### Overview

- A brief description of your project.

This proposal is for the creation of a peer-reviewed academic case study for the application of soulbound tokens within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems by leveraging the Social Recovery pallet and soulbound token use cases developed by the Phala Network and RMRK for digital inheritance. This will be a qualitative case study where we will conduct a literature review of soulbound tokens, as well as interview team members and developers of Phala - Marvin Tong, Joshua Waller, and Wenfeng Wang - as well as team members from RMRK. In addition to the research on soulbound tokens, we will also look to interview members of Parity Technologies who are familiar with the development of the Social Recovery pallet to investigate how it can be applied to digital inheritance. 

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

This project relates to Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama in that all users within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems could implement this digital inheritance model to secure their assets. By leveraging the Social Recovery pallet, users can leverage the Social Recovery Wallet from RFP #1024 to act as a digital executor of user's digital assets. Through this academic research, not only will developers and academic researchers be exposed to the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems, but we will also benefit from the further development and use cases for soulbound tokens, NFTs, and the Social Recovery pallet within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

SydTek is looking to reinvent higher education through the democratization of education and research. After team members have published peer-reviewed academic case studies on Acala (https://bit.ly/3D55XGh) and Bit.Country (https://bit.ly/3wZaHt4) within the Polkadot ecosystem, we look to expand on a theoretical study of soulbound tokens (https://bit.ly/3RnCmMy) that will be published in the Journal of Strategic Innovation and Sustainability
October of 2022 with a practical case study within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

### Project Details
The following excerpt is from SydTek's study on Bit.Country entitled "The Metaverse as the Digital Leviathan: A Case Study of Bit. Country". This provides a primer to the proposed study.

The What?

Older Americans have stockpiled nearly $35 trillion USD over the last few decades and, as a result, contribute up to 27% of all wealth in the United States. Researchers have argued that the time may have come to give this wealth away to the next generation, thereby marking the beginning of “The Great Wealth Transfer.” Kraken, a United States-based cryptocurrency exchange and bank, estimate that Millennials (ages 24 to 39) and Generation Xers (ages 40 to 55) could drive over $1 trillion USD of wealth into cryptocurrencies over the next 25 years as both generations embrace the inherent value of the emerging blockchain technology. While many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have recognized this monetary revolution throughout the past decade, far less have discussed the crucial economic factor that sustains wealth over generations: inheritance, or, in this case, digital inheritance. 

Digital inheritance emerged from the convergence of three previously separate worlds: wealth management, estate planning, and digital assets. Here, a digital asset is something that is stored digitally, is uniquely identifiable, and has some kind of value, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. So naturally, one of the central questions surrounding an individual’s digital assets will relate to digital inheritance: How will individuals pass their cryptocurrencies and NFTs onto their beneficiaries once they pass away? This brings us to a foreseeable rise in digital asset executors, who will be responsible for administering an individual’s last will and testament once they pass away and ensure that their digital assets are appropriately distributed to the relevant beneficiaries through, for example, smart contracts on the blockchain.

Despite the rise of digital asset executors, it would appear that, from a legal point of view, various challenges remain in the way of digital inheritance as being a reliable form of transmitting wealth across generations. In the absence of a private key to an ancestor’s digital wallet, it is neither feasible nor productive to attempt to prove the existence of digital rights through tracing of electronic correspondences, analyses of banking operations, or entries in the registry of rights that reflect transactions with objects certified by tokens. This is where the exploration of the application of soulbound tokens (SBTs) and the Social Recovery Pallet within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems may be a proposed solution.

The Why?

In a 2020 study by the Cremation Institute, 89% of crypto investors worry about dying with their assets while only 23% of those have a documented plan. Of that percentage, only 7% have created a will that includes cryptocurrencies. In another survey, roughly 60% of Americans and over 65% Canadians do not have a will. It was also noted that these numbers could be higher in other parts of the world. This can be attributed to the terror management theory (TMT) and people's fear of dying. We conducted a theoretical case study on soulbound tokens and TMT that can be found here https://bit.ly/3RnCmMy that investigates the possibility of how the introduction of SBTs could alleviate the anxiety and fear of death. Although this use case may be unconventional, it is one that all Web3 users may have to face in their lives.

The How?

This proposal is for the creation of a peer-reviewed academic case study for the application of soulbound tokens within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems by leveraging the Social Recovery pallet and soulbound token use cases developed by the Phala Network and RMRK for digital inheritance. This will be a qualitative case study where we will conduct a literature review of soulbound tokens, as well as interview team members and developers of Phala - Marvin Tong, Joshua Waller, and Wenfeng Wang - as well as team members from RMRK. In addition to the research on soulbound tokens, we will also look to interview members of Parity Technologies who are familiar with the development of the Social Recovery pallet to investigate how it can be applied to digital inheritance.

A message from David Hawig on 6/7/22.
Hi Justin,

Sorry for the late reply. Regarding souldbound tokens and social recovery, that’s actually something we already have in our ecosystem with rmrk (see  
https://twitter.com/bitfalls/status/152929818658155725) and the social recovery pallet on kusama (https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/recovery). But it would be interesting for someone to actually look into it and explore it in more detail and potential future applications. Also most people are probably not aware that this already exists on kusama.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

## Future Plans

After the dissemination of the foundational case study for soulbound tokens and the Social Recovery pallet at institutions and university blockchain clubs globally, we have plans to conduct follow-up research with law students and academic researchers in the field of Law on the potential legal impacts of soulbound tokens on estate law. As Justin Goldston is an Graduate Advisory Board Member at Georgetown University, Law Professors at Georgetown are curious about the impact of NFTs within the legal practice. Additionally, after a presentation for faculty members from the Smeal College of Business and the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State University, which can be seen here https://bit.ly/3AQiH0C on sustainable impacts of the metaverse, Professors from the Dickinson School of Law are also looking to conduct research on NFTs, the metaverse, and law. After the completion and publishing of the original article, the team looks to conduct a follow-up study of the legal impacts of soulbound tokens.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Webinar by David Hawig and David suggested we look into the Social Recovery pallet and SBTs within the Kusama ecosystems via email.
