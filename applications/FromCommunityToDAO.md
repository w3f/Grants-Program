## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkadot Hungary DAO would like to research and develop tools and best practices for
small organizations to help them become better organized, more active within
Polkadot and easier to scale. Having a lot of experience with local and wider
community building (online community as well as long standing regular IRL meetups)
and community participation (active participants in Polkadot Governance and
currently DV delegates in Cohort 4) we think that creating an easy to follow recipe
could be a real help for small decentralized communities to thrive and grow. 

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Automated Proposal Management: Proposals are automatically imported into Notion with details like track, amount requested, links, and content. Prebuilt pages allow DAOs to evaluate proposals efficiently, followed by batch transaction preparation for multisig voting. Post-vote statuses update automatically in the Notion (e.g., ‘Voted Aye’; the extrinsic of the vote and the date of the vote).
- Proxy Voting Flexibility: Votes are cast from a proxy address controlled by the DAO’s multisig, enabling member adjustments without losing delegations.
- Time and Cost Efficiency: Using Mimir’s batching tool, multiple votes are cast instantly for a single $0.3 transaction fee. (Thank you for Mimir’s effort again for the collaboration!) This contrasts with manual voting, where 10-20 weekly votes in a 4/7 multisig could cost $12-$24 and take 15-20 minutes. For 400+ proposals in a cohort, costs drop from $150-$200 to just a $10-20.
- Notion Integration: Unlike tools relying on separate platforms, this tool uses Notion as a database, allowing parallel collaboration with DAO members within an existing task management system.
- Ease of Use: It’s relatively easy to set up, inexpensive to run, unit-tested, and well-documented for modifications and startup.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    - General organisation and community involvement mainly OpenGov.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
    - Any community or emerging DAO wishing to better organise themselves can use it.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
    - Makes it easier to participate in OpenGov voting for communities
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
    - The need emerged from our own experience when we decided to participate and vote on OpenGov as a DAO and amplified when we become DVs.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
    - Permanence DAO’s Telegram bot: Their Telegram bot handles proposal evaluation via Telegram. Using OpenAI integration to summarize comments and automatically post them is efficient. Pretty powerful setup for bigger DAOs.
    - ChaosDAO’s Discord bot: Relies on a single voting method. Hard to see from outside what the reasoning is and it’s based on social trust. Still one of the best tools available for huge DAOs still we would love to see more efforts done on making the voting mechanism more decentralized.
    - Trustless Core’s Google Sheets: While a google sheet is a very simple UI, which can be easily managed by anybody, it isn’t customizable and automated, and requires many manual actions.
    - Hungarian DAO’s voting tool: The tool delivers a powerful, cost-effective, and integrated solution for DAO governance. By automating workflows, reducing costs, and leveraging Notion, it offers a powerful and versatile alternative to tools like Permanence DAO’s Telegram bot and Chaos DAO’s Discord bot or Trustless Core’s google sheet. With exciting future developments, it’s a compelling choice for DAOs aiming to streamline operations.
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?
    - Not relating to voting on OpenGov we know of.

### Team's experience

We are actively following the weekly AAG shows whenever we can and recently started our weekly Office Hours where we did 12 weekly sessions already and all were fully booked. In addition we actively participate in discussions on the Polkadot Forum as well and share our thoughts and ideas on different topics, such as a discussion on the DV program, discussion on OpenGov’s liquid democracy, a discussion on the ambassador program, a discussion on sanctioning fake actors on Polkadot, discussion on the launch of People Chain and many more. Our core members attend the Decoded conference annually, along with smaller regional events whenever possible advocating for Polkadot. We publish weekly news articles based on Polkadotter’s blog, sharing them on both our website and the local news platform Cryptofalka, which has helped us reach a wider Hungarian audience. Educating our community and advocating for Polkadot remains our top priority. We hosted around 30+ Polkadot Meetups in Budapest, Hungary at Mosaic Chain’s office, now an official Polkadot hub, and this year we moved the meetup’s location to Corvinus University. During the January and February meetup we educated attendees about all aspects of Polkadot, including OpenGov, XCM, economics, and parachains as well, such as Polimec, Assethub and Hydration. With extensive experience in organizing in-person events, hackathons, project development, and DAO management, we have built a strong foundation for community engagement. Our largest event to date, Polkadot Day in March 2024, was part of Budapest Blockchain Week and attracted approximately 120 attendees.

## Development Status :open_book:

This voting tool was introduced to seven Polkadot community groups during our regional gathering in Warsaw this March ([**see post**](https://x.com/PolkadotHungary/status/1903541921668067837)). At this community-driven event, representatives from seven Central European Polkadot communities participated. We presented the tool’s functionality and a recommended (but configurable) method of usage. After the live demo and workshop, we forked our own Notion-based workspace, integrated with the voting tool, and shared it individually with all seven communities.

To our knowledge, one of them, Bohemia Fam, aka the [**Czechish DAO**](https://x.com/BohemiaFam) has actively adopted the tool and continues to use it. They have also expressed interest in using it regularly going forward. This shows that some actors within the Polkadot ecosystem are not only interested in but already using the voting tool we’ve developed. We believe this tool can be especially useful for small, locally-organized communities and DAOs, where decision-making processes benefit from lightweight, adaptable governance tools.

It is being constantly tested and refined to ensure ease of use for other communites.

## Future Plans

- Decentralized Version: Plans include a decentralized alternative with DAO management tools and a simplified self-hosted setup.
- Simplified Installation: A setup interface requiring just a Notion API key could make deployment even easier on a VPS or self-hosted environment.
- Browser Extension: An augmented layer (e.g., a custom extension) could enable proposal evaluation directly on platforms like Polkassembly, with DAO members annotating thoughts in real-time, similar to Idriss.xyz’s Twitter tipping layer.
