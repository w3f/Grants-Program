- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in response to the open RFP: https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Open/grant_management_webapp.md

### Overview

The Grant Management Web Application is a comprehensive software solution designed to streamline and enhance the process of managing grants. It aims to provide w3f and other grant-making institutions with a centralized platform to efficiently handle grant applications, evaluation, tracking, reporting, and overall administration. By reducing the number of clicks, the web application will enable better navigation of data, better UI, greater ease and effectiveness in the grant management process.

### Project Details

#### Key Features:

- Organised relevant data.
- Github API integration to carry out relevant actions.

2. Back-End API Integrations

#### Back-End:
1. Front-End API Integrations
2. Github API Integrations
3. Database API Integration
4. Cron Job
5. Data Extractor - Service that extracts data from the MD files for storage
6. Web Hook Handler - Service that will listen to events and then handle the respective functionality

#### Database
![Grant Management Webapp(draft 2)-DB final draft (1)](https://github.com/lawmeskiviahs/Grants-Program/assets/60818312/f133eaba-caca-4ceb-add4-8268d08226a7)

### Things not included in the project:

There is no wallet support/oracle for treasury pallet in this application but these can be integrated upon further discussion.

### Technology Stack

- Front-end: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (React)
- Back-end: Node.js (Express.js)
- Database: MongoDB
- Authentication and Authorization: Github (github apps)
- Cloud Hosting: Github Marketplace

### Ecosystem Fit

The W3F grants program is growing by the day. It is quite a hassle for the grants committee to browse the Grant Program Repositories. This application aims to achieve two things: 1. Consolidate releveant information from the Grant Program Repos; 2. Provide Github Actions functionality to deal with the process of the Grant Program within the app itself.

### Team's experience

- Antier is a thought-to-finish partner for customers in their blockchain journey. We advise and consult our clients on blockchain technologies and tailor solutions utilising our powerful blockchain ecosystem. We help customers experiment and deploy proof-of-concepts on blockchain technologies and incrementally expand to scale to production releases. Our thought leaders regularly educate customers, partners, CXOs on the power of blockchain for today and tomorrow.
- Workdone by Antier in Substrate ecosystem
1. Antier worked on the validator and nominator apps for substrate based blockchains to offer a unique and better user experience .
2. We have also worked on creating an optimised and homogenised design focused on improving the navigation, information architecture, user flow tasks, content design and graphic elements for a seamless and easy browsing experience.
3. We have customised the default reward mechanism in the staking pallet of the substrate chain by integrating the sustainability and reliability score(which is calculated by ESG scores and Uptime of the validators repectively) of the validators in the current reward system.
4. We were able to run EVM and WASM machines natively in the substrate chain so that the chain will be able to support both EVM(Metamask, Remix, Web3.js, etc) and WASM(WebAssembly target, INK framework, etc) tooling.
5. We were able to replicate the whole polkadot ecosystem(Relay chain, Parachains, XCM), Where parachains are use case specific chains and communicate through XCM protocol with each other.

- Our team has been proactively participating in the Substrate Stack exchange and we ask/answer question related to ink!, Substrate, parachain. We rank in the top 6% people in the Substrate Stack Exchange.
