## Project Overview :page_facing_up:



### Overview

##### Executive summary
A freelancing decentralized application (dApp) that allows individuals to create/complete tasks and organize themselves by creating geographically distributed organizations.

##### Brief Description
The creation of Bitcoin allowed for easy exchange of digital tokens of value. Currently, value is created in the real world, and exchanged in the digital world. Our dApp allows for digital creation of value in addition to digital exchange of value.

This dApp will be developed using Substrate. New pallets will create the business logic layer which will allow users to directly interact with each another using tasks. A basic front-end application will be developed as reference.

To be even more concrete, our project improves on the concept of bounties within Polkadot, in the following ways...
- Better UI experience that abstracts out all necessary blockchain knowledge.
- No council approval. Tasks can be created/completed without intermediary.

In addition to the above mentioned points, [universaldot.me](https://universaldot.me) will also have the following features:
- Creation of User profiles with basic metadata. 
- Creation of Organizations with native tokens.
- Transfer of intellectual property through task creation/completion.


The team believes that this dApp will enable an new digital infrastructure for creating digital businesses.

### Ecosystem Fit


 Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- The dApp eventually aims to become a parachain on polkdot. 

Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- Users who want to create decentralized organizations and projects. 

What need(s) does your project meet?
- Easy creation of distributed projects.
- Easier organizations of people who have common vision.
- Guaranteed pay for work done using native tokens. 

Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
- SubSocial due to the social networking similarity. 
  If so, how is your project different?
- Our dApp instead of creating small messages, will create tasks with specified requirements. 
- The People who complete the tasks will be granted a reward. 
- For very complex tasks, organizations are created.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:
### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2.5 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 35,000 USD

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 18,000 USD

| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **video tutorial** that explains how a user can create profiles, tasks and organization. This will demonstrate basic functionality. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Unit tests for each pallet. We will include documentation on how to run tests. (Using Mocks) |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an medium/blog **article** that explains the main features of our dApp.

## Future Plans


In the short term we expect the enhance the functionality of the product using Substrate Builders Program.

We expect to launch a native token from a treasury account. The native coin will be a utility token, and each token will represent unit value of work done (tasks completed on the network).

In the long run, we expect to become Polkadot Parachain.
