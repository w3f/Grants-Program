It utilizes local cryptography and a Substrate blockchain instance to verify, send, and receive messages in real time - just like any other conventional messaging protocol, and can be used to construct messaging apps, or any other application in which real time messaging is needed.</p><p>Substrate is a key part of this solution, as <strong>uke</strong> essentially defies the need for any sort of traditional backend in favor of a <strong>completely DLT based infrastructure.</strong></p><p>Initially, the PoC for this phase will be messaging app, however key components will be built that will allow for many more applications in the future.  The eventual goal is a universal messaging protocol that can be implemented anywhere, and is not dependent on any one centralized backend.</p><p>The purpose of this messaging app is to have it entirely independent of any third party service for both messaging and users - a true representation of web3.</p><p>There is more to uke than just peer to peer messaging - it’s to demonstrate a lot more can be created with DLT than just another cryptocurrency. Rather than exchange currency one another, uke aims to take those same concepts and apply them to data and messaging.</p><p>I am passionate about bringing more value to web3 via this sort of application - something that can be used by people, but also in a wider context of businesses and confidential, secure messaging.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a class="hash-link" href="#project-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>Project Expectations &amp; Goals</strong></p><p>The initial goal for this grant is to allow for the development of a PoC of this messaging protocol in the form of a mobile app.</p><p>In the future, as the protocol becomes more defined, the goal is to develop a suite of SDKs and docs centering around secure and confidential messaging for any use case - with Substrate and its extensive functionality being the core of the solution.</p><p>Uke has a few primary goals and standards to upkeep:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Privacy</strong> - each message sent is completely, and purely, peer to peer - no one else can intercept or decrypt the message.</p></li><li><p><strong>Fault Tolerance / Reliability</strong> - By using DLT, we remove the need for a central server, meaning as long as an amount of nodes are kept online, users can still talk to one another.  This is especially useful in emergency scenarios, as users can even opt to run their own nodes to ensure 100% runtime.</p></li><li><p><strong>Anonymity</strong> - since each user is essentially just a cryptographic key paired with an id, user’s can easily stay anonymous on and off chain if they so wish to choose.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Technology Stack</strong></p><p>For the front end, Ionic will be used for all web, Android and iOS versions.</p><p>The backend will purely be DLT based - for this one, a Substrate instance will be run to send messages back and forth between accounts.  A custom pallet to interact and properly store messages in Substrate storage will be developed to do so.</p><p>Below are the summarized languages / tech stack</p><ul><li>Typescript / Javascript</li><li>Rust</li><li>Ionic</li></ul><p><strong>High Level Architecture</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/922350668264652810/1027258529108721704/Screenshot_2022-10-05_at_12.38.31_PM.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong><em>As a general overview, each message will be a signed extrinsic, and each user is essentially merely an account on the blockchain.</em></strong></p><p><strong>Components</strong></p><p><em>For the purposes of defining the Uke PoC / MVP, the initial functionality of the uke pallet will only handle messaging and message storage.  However, in the future, it is planned to implement further functionality, such as a more robust identity registrar and account filter system.</em></p><ol><li><strong>UKE PALLET</strong></li></ol><p>Using Substrate allows for the creation of a custom pallet, which will have two primary functions for this PoC:</p><ul><li><p>Handle message transmission and conversation storage (via a few key <code>StorageMaps</code> for managing active and ongoing conversations).</p></li><li><p>Basic identity mapping (<code>register()</code> function to allow for a mapping of <code>BoundedVec&lt;u8&gt;</code> to <code>AccountId</code> for easy lookup).</p></li></ul><p>The messages will be stored and read from the Substrate storage via a common <code>StorageMap</code> for the time being.  Functionality will be included to retrieve the conversation state without having to load all messages as well.</p><p>In order to identity unique conversations, an ID (<code>convo_id</code>) is used to retrieval the correct conversation between two particular users. This id is generated by hashing the sender and recipient addresses to create a unique, yet deterministic way to identity conversations in storage.</p><p>For identifying each user, a mapping for cryptographic addresses to more human readable names will also be created within the pallet. It essentially it maps unique, human readable ids to otherwise illegible addresses.</p><p>With this mapping of addresses, users can then look up other users and add them to their contacts, or write them a new message, or any other package of data in theory.</p><ol start="2"><li><strong>Substrate Instance</strong></li></ol><p>The Substrate Instance will allow for all messages to be propagated, consensus to take place, as well as smart contracts to be deployed in a guaranteed environment as needed.  </p><ol start="3"><li><strong>Uke Messaging App</strong></li></ol><p>The eventual conclusion, and primary deliverable of this proposal is representing all of the aforementioned technology into an easy to use, hybrid mobile app that will be released for use.  This app can be used across either Kusama or custom Uke networks, whatever is deemed fit upon launch.  The app will encrypt messages on the client side, where the encrypted text will be stored within the Substrate node.</p><p><strong>Mockups and Design of PoC App</strong></p><p><em>Keep in mind these are mockups, and are subject to change</em></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/922350668264652810/1019031136103579748/uke-collection2x.png?width=1180&amp;height=1226" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a class="hash-link" href="#ecosystem-fit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>The eventual goal is to provide a streamlined way to for the following in the Substrate / Polkadot ecosystem:</p><ol><li>Provide a common, and easy to use identity solution</li><li>Provide an out-of-the-box, flexible, and confidential messaging protocol which can be used for many different usecases.</li></ol><p>The target audience here is our own user-base eventually, but also developers through opensourcing all work done here along with documentation on how one can also setup their own messaging using our tools.</p><p>Currently, there is no standard for how one can build a dapp quickly, and that does something common. This can serve as a baseline for how a dapp can function without the use of cryptocurrency or the like.</p><p>What makes us different:</p><ol><li><p>No traditional backends are used here. Everything is purely based off of Substrate, as shown in the architecture diagram.</p></li><li><p>In our designs, the use of DLT/blockchain is not shown - this is intentional, as it allows users to merely experience a secure messaging experience without the cumbersome interface.</p></li></ol><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team">Team<a class="hash-link" href="#team" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a class="hash-link" href="#team-members" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li>Bader Youssef - Team Lead, Architect, and Fullstack Developer.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a class="hash-link" href="#contact" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Bader Youssef</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:ibnbassem@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ibnbassem@gmail.com</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a class="hash-link" href="#legal-structure" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> N/A</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> N/A</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a class="hash-link" href="#teams-experience" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Bader has previously built over systems on both Ethereum and the NEM/Symbol blockchain - part of which you may see on his Github.
