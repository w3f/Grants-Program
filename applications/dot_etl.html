Furthermore, we intend to develop a framework to ETL Substrate to <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google BigQuery</a>, orchestrated via <a href="https://cloud.google.com/composer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Cloud Composer</a>.  </p><p>The Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems have nurtured a significant developer community, and hosts a number of well-known parachains spanning a diverse series of domains, including Defi lending / liquidity, DEXs, NFTs, RWAs and securitization, as well as identity and privacy applications.  While there has been a great deal of interest in developing on polkadot, there hasn&#x27;t thus far been a simple means to query and visualize transaction-level data and aggregates. </p><p>Dot-ETL will be similar in functionality to the <a href="https://ethereum-etl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum ETL project</a>. In the same way that the ETH-ETL offering Ethereum transaction data as a Public Dataset from Google has helped to establish higher TVL and adoption of the Ethereum network, the goal is that by making PolkaDot transactional data easily accessible without the majority of data engineering tasks that exist in extracting data in usable form from the blockchain will lead to greater development and interest for the protocol by mainstream users of platforms such as Google Cloud. Once data is supported and provided in this format, there are also other potential use cases that can expand adoption of PolkaDot data by the blockchain industry such as easily being able to host Chainlink oracles for this data and provide it in readily available form for a number of different cross-chain applications. The open nature of the google bigquery dataset would allow anyone to query and extract insights from on-chain activity via SQL, or even build visualizations on thedata. </p><p>Upon successful completion of the primary data structures (blocks, extrinsics, events), we plan to provide a framework / pattern to extract extrinsics tailored to specific parachains.  We may explore Defi and RWAs in more depth: we believe that providing focus on DeFi activity related to Real World Assets on Google Cloud is the most promising use of public data to attract attention to the ecosystem.</p><p>We also intend to publish guides on how to query and use the dataset (i.e. medium articles, github wikis, gitbook document site).   The source code for Dot-ETL will be made public through the Web3 foundation. </p><p>The team has extensive technical background in backend software engineering and machine learning / data science, and domain knowledge in machine learning, financial services (both retail as well as institutional), lending, and quantitative risk management. Our expertise and extensive domain experience, particularly in real world usage of data in Fintech and DeFi, will allow for us to build with adoption and practical use in mind.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>(Technical Details)</p><p>The Dot-ETL project will utilize prior work on the SubQuery project to index and source block/event/call data on the Polkadot blockchain.  The SubQuery project is already able to index and parse block / extrinsic(transaction) / event data on Substrate, persist into a postgres data schema, and serve queries on the data via GraphQL. </p><p>Our ETL framework will consume the indexed data on a managed SubQuery node via GraphQL, and save to Google BigQuery in a format similar to existing blockchain-etl projects.  We plan to orchestrate this ETL to BigQuery via the Google Composer offering on GCP as Airflow DAGs, written in Python.  </p><p>The design of the ETL will allow for a varied series of output formats.  Users of the framework can choose to download the code and run their own copy of the ETL locally against the SubQuery node, or they can utilize the GCP BigQuery offering.  We expect most users of the ETL data to utilize the public offering.</p><p>The architecture and process of executing airflow pipelines within GCP composer are fairly well-documented.  We expect that the infrastructure / architectural components for Dot-ETL will be similar to standard deployments within GCP composer - we are unlikely to require anything truly bespoke.</p><p>The first milestone of the project will focus around blocks, extrinsics and events in Substrate, and will produce the same base-level tables (blocks, extrinsics, events).  Subsequent milestones will propose a means to extract specific extrinsics / events from particular pallets and parachains, with a possible focus on Defi / RWAs.  <strong>We believe that providing focus on DeFi activity related to Real World Assets on Google Cloud is the most promising use of public data to attract attention to the Polkadot ecosystem.</strong></p><p>We&#x27;re still investigating the appropriate schema details that will capture data in the most useful /optimal way, but believe that the core tables / schema will be very similar to that of the <a href="https://ethereum-etl.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ethereum ETL project</a>.  </p><p>There are two main components of the project.  The first is the configuration of the SubQuery managed node that will index the components of Substrate that we are interested in. The second component is the Airflow DAG that will communicate with the SubQuery node via a GraphQL API.  The DAG will write updates to underlying formats. The initial focus will be on writing to BigQuery tables, but the framework should be written such that other providers / database formats can be accommodated.  While we may not write drivers / handlers for each provider or database type, the framework will be written in such a way that will allow the community to write specific handlers that can be easily plugged into the existing framework.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>Questions / Answers on Ecosystem Fit: </p><p><strong>Q: Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?</strong></p><p>A: Our aim is to provide a foundational framework and approach to ETLing Substrate data into the GCP BigQuery cloud storage medium (+ other mediums as needed).  A robust illustrative example will allow others to build upon / extend the framework, and run and maintain the ETL process for general community use.  By transforming into GCP BigQuery, we hope to drastically lower the friction required for anyone to analyze and produce insights on the data (developers, analysts, investors, enthusiasts).  </p><p><strong>Q: Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp&#x27;s userbase, yourself)?</strong></p><p>A: Everyone. By building a framework that will make data available in a way that can be queried via SQL, and in conjunction with a repository of query recipes and articles / guides / docs, we allow anyone with some base-level analysis interest to get up and running quickly.  Because transaction-level data will also be available in a standard data query format on Google cloud, it will be possible to create any number of dashboards and visualizations on third-party / cloud-based analytic tools.</p><p><strong>Q: What need(s) does your project meet?</strong></p><p>A: Analysis / Insights - ability for people (all audience types) to query transaction data at any granularity.  Putting this data into an approachable format opens the ability for users to create reports, visualizations, monitors and notifications.  Better visibility =&gt; more engagement / better understanding =&gt; stronger community. Most users of data don&#x27;t have the data engineering skills or capacity to extract data of this form onto a platform like Google Cloud platform, while remaining highly adept at querying, analyzing and modeling this type of data on such a platform. The DOT-ETl project is meant to remove the major data engineering barrier that exists for these individuals to take advantage of the technological offerings Google Cloud platform in working with PolkaDot data.</p><p><strong>Q: Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem? If so, how is your project different?  If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?</strong></p><p>A: There is already a team that has created substrate-etl on Google BigQuery.   However, we believe there is value to creating redundancy by providing a competing approach to the problem.  Our approach differs in two ways (technically): (a) use of the SubQuery indexer, whereas the competing team utilized their own indexer (polkaholic), (b) use of google composer / airflow.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Jonathan</li><li>John</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Jonathan Liang</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:jonathan.h.liang@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jonathan.h.liang@gmail.com</a></li><li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://github.com/liangjh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/liangjh</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> N/A</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> N/A</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>The team has extensive technical background backend software engineering and machine learning / data science, and domain knowledge in machine learning, financial services (both retail as well as institutional), lending, and quantitative risk management (market trading risk as well as bank capital).</p><p>Jonathan has worked in both fintech in backend software engineering, as well as institutional financial firms (investment banks / hedge funds) in quantitative risk roles.
