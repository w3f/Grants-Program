### Development Status :open_book:

Our project is currently in a transition phase, evolving from a GitHub repository into a full-fledged platform. Here's a breakdown of our current status and the work we've conducted before applying:

- **Design Phase**: We have completed the design phase of the project, resulting in a comprehensive [design mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/4JD8UyfvdSgLTKxXZJgYBe/Awesomedot?type=design&node-id=164-7152&mode=design&t=bKm2d6McDV75QVAJ-0) and a high-fidelity [prototype in Figma](https://www.figma.com/proto/4JD8UyfvdSgLTKxXZJgYBe/Awesomedot?type=design&node-id=164-7204&t=bKm2d6McDV75QVAJ-0&scaling=min-zoom&page-id=164%3A7152&starting-point-node-id=164%3A8545).

- **Development Strategy**: Our unique approach positions our [awesome-dot GitHub repository](https://github.com/Awesomedot/awesome-dot/) as the core API for our platform. The repository, currently containing lists in markdown format, will be refined to align with our platform's requirements.

- **Contribution Mechanism**: Recognizing the importance of community contributions, we're designing a user-friendly form UI. This interface will allow users to contribute directly to the repo. By logging in with their GitHub accounts, users can fill the form, which will then generate a PR to the repository, streamlining the contribution process.

- **Previous Discussions**: While we haven't had direct conversations with anyone from the Web3 Foundation about this project, our deep involvement in the Polkadot ecosystem and our contributions, like [dotfordummies.com](http://dotfordummies.com) and translations for the Polkadot website, underscore our commitment and understanding of the space.

Our focus remains on ensuring "awesome-dot.com" is not just a platform but an experience, and our development strategy reflects this vision.
