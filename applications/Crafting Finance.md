# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Crafting Finance
* **Team Name:** [crafting](https://github.com/CraftingFinance)
* **Payment Address:** 34ZrE7cVNGHBiGDTRBaEngAUUv7grgBQTW

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

Crafting Finance is an open financial platform integrating synthetic asset issuance, collateral lending, decentralized exchange and stablecoin. Synthetic asset issuance is a very important part of it, which will bring all kinds of asset classes on the planet into the Polkadot ecosystem. Crafting is committed to making breakthrough contributions to the stablecoin and DeFi in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Overview

The synthetic asset issuance platform created by Crafting Finance is decentralized, multi-asset collateralized and supports cross-chain. The biggest differences between it and existing synthetic asset platforms (e.g. Synthetix on Ethereum) are that it can support multiple assets as collaterals due to the nature of cross chain of Polkadot firstly. Crafting Finance will support the token of the project itself (CRF), Polkadot (DOT), Kusama (KSM), Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH). More importantly, Crafting Finance can issue a variety of synthetic assets which can be fitted into four categories as stablecoins (RaftStable), simple synthetic assets (Raft), custom synthetic assets (UnivRaft), and synthetic bonds (BondRaft). By this way, all the assets of the world can be mapped in this system. In general, the synthetic asset issuance and decentralized exchange in the Crafting Finance constitute a complete Defi system in the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Project Details 
The main functional modules of the entire system include: forging synthetic assets(MintR), decentralized contract exchange (Kingsman), collateral pools, fee pools and oracles.

#### Forging Synthetic Assets(MintR)
The synthetic assets issued by the entire system are all produced by users staking certain collateral. The initial collateral includes CRF, DOT, KSM, BTC and ETH, and the collateralization ratio depends on the variation of the collateral itself. In the future, the collateral and collateralization ratio can be adjusted through community governance. When users stake collaterals and forge synthetic assets, corresponding debts are generated. When the user wants to unlock the collateral, he must repay the debt, that is, destroy the previously generated synthetic assets.

There are mainly four kinds of synthetic assets: stablecoins (RaftStable), simple synthetic assets (Raft), custom synthetic assets (UnivRaft), and synthetic bonds (BondRaft).

##### Stablecoins (RaftStable)
Stablecoins are a very important part of synthetic assets, such as rUSD and rEuro which can be used as denomination currency in the whole system as well as contract trading. Furthermore, stablecoins can also be used as collateral lending. Users can borrow stablecoins such as rUSD and exchange it into real world dollars. 

##### Simple synthetic assets (Raft)
Simple synthetic assets can be cryptocurrencies such as rBTC and rETH, stocks such as rAAPL, gold such as rXAU and any real world assets.

##### Custom synthetic assets (UnivRaft)
Custom synthetic assets means that users can issue any kind of a financial contract through this system. By this way, we can stimulate any financial derivatives and include the whole world’s assets.

##### Synthetic bonds (BondRaft)
Synthetic bonds are synthetic assets paying interest issued by the system.

#### DEX (Kingsman)
It is an exchange that provides conversion of different synthetic assets and contract trading. Due to the design characteristics of Crafting Finance, this DEX does not require a counterparty, and there is no issue of transaction depth.

#### Collateral Pool
The collateral pool is the sum of synthetic assets generated by all users. According to the amounts of synthetic assets generated by each user, the debt pool also records the proportion of each user's debt. Whenever a new synthetic asset is generated, the debt ratio of the system must be recalculated.

#### Fee Pool
Users trading or converting synthetic assets on the DEX will incur transaction fees. The fee ratio is tentatively set at 0.3%, and these fees all enter the fee pool. All the fees are distributed to users in proportion to the debt. The system stipulates that only users whose collateral is the CRF can receive rewards, as an incentive for CRF holders. Because the CRF price fluctuates, it is stipulated that only users who meet the collateralization ratio are eligible to receive rewards.

#### Oracle
Since the price of contract trading needs to be read from outside sources, the oracle is a very critical part of this project. In the initial stage, the system will use the centralized oracles provided by the project team, and in the future, it will introduce more secure decentralized oracles.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  4 FTE
* **Total Costs:** 0.3 BTC

### Milestone 1 — Forging Synthetic Assets(MintR)
* **Estimated Duration:** 1.5 month

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how forging synthetic assets. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. | 
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. |
| 1. | Substrate pallet: MintR | We will create a Substrate pallet that will realize the functions of staking CRF, DOT, KSM, BTC and ETH, forging synthetic assets, including stablecoins (RaftStable) and custom synthetic assets (UnivRaft). |
| 2. | Substrate front end | MintR pallet will interact in substrate-front-end-template. |

## Future Plans
There is still a lot of space for growth in the future, including:

At present, the type of synthetic assets of the project is determined by the project team or community governance. In the future, it is planned to upgrade so that different investors can independently sign any type of contract on this system.

At present, the stablecoin rUSD or other synthetic assets produced by the project are limited to the system. When there are standardized tokens similar to Ethereum ERC-20 on the Polkadot in the future, all synthetic assets of this project can be circulated outside the system in the form of standardized tokens, and even enter other exchanges. Among them, rUSD can become an important stable currency in the Polkadot ecology.
