## Project Overview

### Overview

With the launch of Polkadot Parachain, the browser extension wallet, as an infrastructure, will play an important role in the interaction between Polkadot and parachain. However, the application market currently lacks an experience-friendly Polkadot browser extension wallet, so Doter came into being.  

We are committed to building Doter into a truly user-centric browser extension wallet, attracting users to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem by providing a clear and concise UI experience and rich on-chain governance functions.  

Now, we can already [install Doter](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/doter/abamjefkidngfegdjbmffdmbgjgpaobf) in the Google Chrome extension market.  

### Project Details 

#### Functional structure

#### Core components
The Doter consists of several core components：  

Account part: with the help of Doter, users can create account, retrieve account, and backup account conviently. Through these accounts, users can complete a series of core interactions with the Polkadot ecosystem.  

Transfer part: Users can easily select the transfer person, transfer amount and estimate the cost of miners. Friendly tips help users to operate easily.  

Query part: Doter provides many portals to facilitate users to query some common chain information, such as account balance, transfer records, community governance and so on.  

Setting part: with the help of this part, users can easily set the extension to make it closer to their habits.  

A lot of common community public packages are used to ensure the consistency and correctness of business logic in Doter, such as @polkadot/api, @polkadot/keyring, @polkadot/util etc. In the specific development process, we use a lot of encapsulated public packages based on web technology, so as to ensure a good experience in the browser.

### Ecosystem Fit 

#### Competitive product analysis
Polkadot's browser extension wallet, the currently known competitor is Enzyme.  
* From the perspective of feature richness, the functional modules achieved by Doter's first milestone have exceeded Enzyme (Recently, we have completed the first milestone), and more functional modules that will serve the Polkadot ecology will be implemented in the plan.  
* From the perspective of UI experience, Doter is a real user-centric wallet. A clear and concise UI experience is more attractive to users, and Doter has achieved Chinese and English language switching, which has a wider potential user group.    
* From the perspective of github maintenance frequency, Enzyme has not been maintained for more than 1 year. In contrast, Doter has a clear development roadmap and the code base is constantly updated.   

#### The difference between Doter and polkadot.js extension
Polkadot.js extension is an official account management tool, Compared with polkadot.js extension, Doter's positioning is not only an account management tool. 
Doter will also implements a series of common functions in Polkadot ecology, such as Transfer and receive, query transaction records, wallet management, easy-to-operate on-chain governance modules, etc. This means that doter can not only interact well with other dapps, but also independently complete the functions mentioned above, providing users with a one-stop experience, which polkadot.js extension does not have.   

In addition, Doter will also provide a completely user-centric UI experience to make it easier for users to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem.  

#### Product direction and advantages
Analogous to MetaMask, in the current industry environment, browser extension wallets are more convenient to interact with DApp than mobile wallets. Doter is positioned as a browser extension wallet and has a first-mover advantage in the product direction.    

At the same time, most of the current mobile wallets connected to Polkadot are not dedicated to the Polkadot ecosystem, and there is no in-depth development based on Polkadot. Doter focuses on the Polkadot ecosystem and enables more users to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem through customized and truly friendly interactive experience.  

#### How to maintain the wallet
In the near future, Our team will have someone in charge of maintaining the Doter, Update at least once a month to fix bugs or improve the experience，to making Doter as close as possible to mature browser extension in other ecosystems(such as Ethereum)  

Simultaneously, we will build our own community as soon as possible. We believe that a solid community is the foundation for Doter to seize the market, Through word of mouth from seed users, we will accumulate the first batch of users. After completing all the milestones, we will place advertisements in a number of blockchain media, and rapidly expand the number of users through advertising. Secondly, we will embed a frequently used DApp in the wallet and cultivate user habits through this, so that Doter will gradually become the portal of the Polkadot ecosystem.  

In summary, we have appropriate market timing, clear product direction, reliable development progress, friendly UI experience, detailed operation planning, and the most important thing is that we have a reliable team, We have 3 Years of work experience in NASDAQ listed company, we have the ability to make Doter a competitive product.

## Future Plans

Doter’s development team is ChainBridgeNetworkTeam. As the name suggests, our long-term vision is to be a bridge between different blockchains. We will use trust-free cross-chain asset custody and on-chain mapping to enable digital assets on different chains to be interoperable.  

Doter is our first product. We believe that with the launch of the parachain, Doter will act as an important interaction bridge in the Polkadot ecosystem. After completing the development of 2 milestones, we will design Doter version 2.0. In version 2.0, users can easily manage private digital assets without memorizing mnemonic words. This will be achieved through an innovative technology. We believe in version 2.0 Doter will greatly reduce the threshold for users to use wallets, making Doter a real bridge between Polkadot and ordinary users.  

## Additional Information
ChainBridgeNetworkTeam has just been established for two months, but we have completed the basic module of Doter, and have designed the other two milestones. In the next two months, we will deliver all pre-designed functional modules.  

So far, we have developed at our own expense, but in order to have sufficient funds to support the realization of our long-term vision, we will try to obtain the support of investment institutions.
