# Zeeve - Substrate parachain DevOps Automation

- **Team Name:** [Zeeve](https://www.zeeve.io)
- **Payment Address:** Ethereum (USDT/USDC) 0x5E1257E928aa42E3D0cd9E2A7537E37D108D811B
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 3

### Overview
Blockchain adoption is happening at a very rapid rate, with a lot many use cases being implemented and seeing the light of the day. The concept of the parachain enables the possibilities further. While we focus on building the use cases, code them and implement the business logic of it, including the creation of Parachain and then further logic running upon it, we majorly underestimate the DevOps activity to deploy, maintain, scale and manage the parachain itself. This includes initial launch of the parachain, its thorough testing using Zoombie-net and scaling it further by providing support for users to create and deploy validator, full and archive nodes with ease as well as to have secure RPC endpoints. The most deficit we see is around advanced analytics and proactive monitoring to ensure a production grade incident management of networks and nodes.

### Project Details
Zeeve will provide a command line based tool to setup of new Substrate parachain network with in-depth and flexible configurations in few clicks on the cloud of choice to distribute nodes upon (AWS, GCP, DigitalOcean and Linode) - supporting K8 and native VMs whichever fits the parachains better.

A GUI will be built to allow a quick setup of the parachain with zombie-net with the desired capabilities to test multiple configurations and compare the results. This in turn will allow the developers and parachain teams to try multiple chain configurations while setting up the parachains with Zoombie-net, as well as to choose different nodes to try and test for the best possibilities on the parachain.

This not only will allow configurations on the parachain side but will also allow you to pick different DSL templates on Zombie net as well as creating new templates without needing to write the code. The configurator will be an intuitive graphical wizard based interface to create in-depth [Network definition spec](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/network-definition-spec.html#network-definition-spec) and apply on the go. Furthermore, to allow seamless testing using the dynamic wizard based DSL creation allowing to choose and configure all available [Assertions](https://paritytech.github.io/zombienet/cli/test-dsl-definition-spec.html#available-assertions)

The graphical control panel will support all the other configurations or operations required to enable the developer or parachain team to test with as much flexibility as required. These operations include:

 - Restart - after x seconds, will stop the `process` and start again after the `x`amount of seconds or immediately.
 - Stop - will pause (SIGSTOP) the process)
- Resume - will pause (SIGCONT) the process)
- Sleep - will allow config to sleep the test-runner for `x` ammount of seconds)

**Test result and logs**
The interface will allow the developer to test and see live logs of the test run, post run results and logs on the aforementioned interface and save them for analysis later to be able to compare with the previous executions on demand. Furthermore, a stack of Prometheus and Grafana will allow easy monitoring of the parachain nodes. Along with the mentioned CLI capabilities to the developers.

**Templating**
The control panel will also allow the developer or the parachain team to one-click replicate one of the existing network configurations, save as template or pick from previously saved template and re-create a new test with some rapid tweaks to it.

## Development Status :open_book:

Before applying for the Web3 Foundation Grant, the Zeeve team has built a DevOps automation for Polkadot and other substrate chains, also created substrates based relay chains:

- Automated Polkadot deployments including validator nodes, archive nodes [here](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polkadot-node/)
- Automated Kusama deployments including validator nodes, archive nodes [here](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-kusama-node/)
- Created a relay chain on substrate with some customisations done at the core to accomodate the tokenomics and custom reward mechanism [here](https://axscan.axiacoin.network/#/explorer)
- Published a [blog post](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/how-to-use-substrate-to-create-parachains-in-polkadot/) about the usage and omlememtation of praachains
- The focus for Zeeve will be automating the parachain deployments, dedicated node setups and help with faster testing with zombie-net.
- Spoke with David Hawig, Richard Casey and Gautam Dhameja from the Parity team regarding the development of Zeeve and the Web3 Grant application

## Future Plans
- We will promote the project by giving talks in the community, writing tutorials and videos.
- We will spread the project in Zeeve's developer and client community of 15K+
- We will also work closely with the developers and clients of the Parity ecosystem for getting feedback and refine our project.
- Our long-term plan is to make the tool become one of the default Parachain tools for the Parity ecosystem.
- We will also add more followup, integration with the Zeeve enterprise platform allowing more flexibility for enterprises to built and deploy use case or application specific parachains.
