### Overview

Blockchain adoption is happening at a very rapid rate, with a lot many use cases being implemented and seeing the light of the day. The concept of the parachain enables the possibilities further. While we focus on building the use cases, code them and implement the business logic of it, including the creation of Parachain and then further logic running upon it, we majorly underestimate the DevOps activity to deploy, maintain, scale and manage the parachain itself. This includes initial launch of the parachain, its thorough testing using Zombie-net and scaling it further by providing support for users to create and deploy validator, full and archive nodes with ease as well as to have secure RPC endpoints. The most deficit we see is around advanced analytics and proactive monitoring to ensure a production grade incident management of networks and nodes.

### Project Details

Zeeve will provide a GUI tool to setup the new Substrate zombie-net network with in-depth and flexible configurations in few clicks supporting K8 and native VMs whichever fits the parachains better.

A GUI will be built to allow a quick setup of the relaychain, parachain with zombie-net with the desired capabilities to test multiple configurations. This in turn will allow the developers and parachain teams to try multiple chain configurations while setting up the parachains with Zombie-net, as well as to choose different nodes to try and test for the best possibilities on the parachain.

This not only will allow configurations on the parachain side but will also allow you to pick from a set of predefined DSL templates on Zombie-net as well as upload the new templates without needing to write the code. The graphical control panel will support all the other configurations or operations required to enable the developer or parachain team to test with as much flexibility as required. These operations include:

- Start - Start the network with configured info (templates)
  - Start the network for either evaluation or testing
- Delete - will stop the processes and delete it
- View Info - view execution logs and command

**Test result and logs**

The interface will allow the developer to test and see live logs of the test run, post run results and logs on the aforementioned interface. Furthermore, a stack of Prometheus and Grafana will allow easy monitoring of the Zombienet.

**Templating**

The control panel will also allow the developer or the parachain team to one-click replicate one of the existing zombie-net configurations, save as template or pick from previously saved template and re-create a new test with some rapid tweaks to it.

### Team's experience

  

Founded by a team of experienced professionals and entrepreneurs from industry, Zeeve's co-founders collectively have over 45+ years of experience in technology, product development, and various business verticals. Zeeve has built an enterprise-grade no-code Blockchain Infrastructure Automation platform that enables Enterprises, Blockchain Startups, Blockchain Consulting Companies and Web3 Developers to deploy Blockchain nodes and Decentralised Apps within minutes, and manage them with advanced analytics and real-time alerts. In June 2022, the Startup raised $2.65 Million in a Seed Round from Leo Capital and Blu Ventures. It plans to deploy the funds towards product development, augmenting the technology team and enhancing its reach among DApp developers and global corporations, please consider visiting our prior [work](https://www.zeeve.io/platform).

## Development Status :open_book:

  

Before applying for the Web3 Foundation Grant, the Zeeve team has built a DevOps automation for Polkadot and other substrate chains, also created substrates based relay chains:

  

- Automated Polkadot deployments including validator nodes, archive nodes [here](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polkadot-node/)

- Automated Kusama deployments including validator nodes, archive nodes [here](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-kusama-node/)

- Created a relay chain on substrate with some customisations done at the core to accommodate the tokenomics and custom reward mechanism [here](https://axscan.axiacoin.network/#/explorer)

- Published a [blog post](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/how-to-use-substrate-to-create-parachains-in-polkadot/) about the usage and implementation of parachains

- The focus for Zeeve will be automating the parachain deployments, dedicated node setups and help with faster testing with zombie-net.

- Spoke with David Hawig, Richard Casey and Gautam Dhameja from the Parity team regarding the development of Zeeve and the Web3 Grant application

  

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

  

### Overview

  

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 months
