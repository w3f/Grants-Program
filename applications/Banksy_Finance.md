## Project Description :page_facing_up:

At present, the major NFT trading platforms are all based on Ethereum. However, its high transaction fee makes a huge threshold for users on high valuable NFTs. It hinders the users` participants a lot. Meanwhile, the major NFT trading platforms are isolated from each other without a unified NFT price discovery mechanism that will be much difficult for users to learn and use the different platforms. Thereby, an NFT aggregated trading platform with lower transaction costs, higher liquidity premium, and more friendly usage is an urgent need for NFT creators and enthusiasts.

### Overview

Banksy-Finance is a decentralized NFT financial hub that will provide a Polkadot-based NFT cross-platform ecosystem and NFT financial services infrastructure with high scalability and lower transaction costs. It mainly comes with two aspects: NFT cross-platform aggregated transaction and NFT Oracle. Banksy will be the first NFT financial hub, bringing a greater volume of NFT trading markets in Polkadot ecosystem.

* Cross-platform Aggregated Transactions : Banksy supports cross-chain and cross-platform aggregated transactions. Banksy can connect every parallel chain on the Polkadot ecosystem and other main public chains on the protocol via Parachain and cross-chain bridges. It can achieve NFT transactions and NFT smart contract calling between different main chains with the help of cross-chain bridges. Banksy Market has designed multiple NFT trading methods, including auction, mortgages, rentals, liquidity mining, fragmentation, etc. So, users can view and trade NFTs from other platforms only in Banksy platform. It will much improve the liquidity of NFT.

* NFT Oracle : Banksy collects and integrates all NFT-related data such as historical transaction prices, multi-dimensional attribute characteristics, and similar NFT pricing, and uses artificial intelligence algorithms to evaluate NFT valuations to provide real-time fair and open prices for existing and newly created NFTs . Banksy Oracle provides a complete set of technical solutions to meet the needs of data requests, including providing NFT prices, data verification, arbitration, and incentive and penalty mechanisms. Meanwhile, in order to maintain the diversity and sustainability of data resources, reputation contracts, order matching contracts and summary contracts have been launched.The reputation contract monitors the performance indicators of the data provider, and the order matching smart contract uses the reputation contract to select bids. The summary contract collects the response of the oracle provider and calculates the final result of the NFT Oracle query.

* Transaction Aggregator

  Banksy market can seamlessly connect NFTs across platforms, support ERC721 and ERC1155 protocols, allow users to view and trade all NFTs on the platform, and support cross-platform aggregation of transactions.

* Innovative auction

  The Banksy platform supports regular auctions, including Dutch auction and British auction. Meanwhile, Banksy innovatively has created NFT Vickery auction, in which all the buyers can bid by sealed bid,  the highest bidder will get the NFT being auctioned and pay with the second highest bid price.

* Mortgages and rentals

  NFTs can be mortgaged on the marketplace through the smart contracts. Other users can choose and use the NFTs that they like by providing a mortgage or rental.

* Liquidity mining

  The user mortgages NFTs in the liquidity pool and get incentives with appropriate KSY Tokens released according to Oracle evaluation. Other LP Tokens or KSYs can also be mortgaged for liquid mining.

* Fragmentation

  Banksy supports NFT fragmentation into ERC20 Tokens, which can be traded on the decentralized trading platform. Banksy supports both single NFT and NFT combinations fragmentating.

* DAO

  Users holding with tokens KSY will be able to participate in platform project financing, governance of the community, and sharing value.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Banksy is an integrated trading platform that supports NFT transactions, auctions, mortgages, rentals, liquidity mining, fragmentation, and supports NFT in a variety of categories, including art, games, virtual land, collectibles, music, etc.

* The original NFT Oracle provides fair and objective pricing for existing and newly created NFT. It enables Banksy Market transactions to be completed efficiently and increase the overall liquidity of NFT.

* Relying on Polkadot's cross-chain bridge technology, Banksy can open up other parachains and other mainstream public chains, and can strongly support NFT cross-chain aggregation transactions.

* Comparation with other platforms
