## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of a n earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

#### High-level Summary
- Substrate implementation of [Semaphore](https://semaphore.pse.dev/) and [Rate-Limiting Nullifier](https://rate-limiting-nullifier.github.io/rln-docs/) pallets for use by other pallets and offchain applications

#### Description 
- Context:
    - Semaphore is a tool based on zero-knowledge proofs for anonymously proving membership in a group. This tool boosts privacy, as the group consists of a merkle tree of identity commitments, which may be anonymous.
    - Rate-Limiting Nullifier builds on Semaphore. It is a similar protocol, except that it also involves computing a secret key with [Shamir's Secret Sharing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_secret_sharing) per each epoch of an application, incrementally revealing shares of a sender's key when that sender sends a message. This reveal of someone's share is a deterrent to any individual participant spamming the protocol with messages.

- A brief description of your project.
    - This project consists of core components of Semaphore and Rate-Limiting Nullifier.
        - Circuits, written in Rust, for generating proofs of the above protocols.
        - Pallets for verifying proofs generated by the circuits mentioned above.
        - A: [P2P multiwriter event feed](https://github.com/nabladelta/lambdadelta/blob/master/docs/architecture/general.md) pallet for example purposes. This will be dependent on the rate limiting nullifier pallet.
        - Additional components of Semaphore and Rate-limiting nullifier are not included. 
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
    - This project should be used by others in Substrate interested in integrating:
        - Private/anonymous sets
        - Anonymous rate-limiting(sybil resistance)
    - Example use cases are:
        - Anonymous offchain applications with sybil protection
        - Anonymous onchain transactions
            - NFT auction
            - DAO voting
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
    - Underserved ZK tooling in Polkadot ecosystem in terms of quality and amount of tools.
    - Semaphore and RLN are well-known and researched protocols designed to address challenges around privacy and sybil resistance

### Project Details
- Assumptions: 
    - The pallets will be implemented on the substrate node template
    - We likely will not work on reducing trust assumptions from the circuit to the onchain state
- Proof System
    - The system will rely on Groth16 proofs, supplied through the Arkworks framework as a prover backend. 
    - Groth16 was chosen for matching the original Semaphore project(at first), its efficiency, and widespread use.

#### Pallet Design

Semaphore:
```rust
// Extrinsics
pub fn verify(origin: OriginFor<T>, proof: BoundedVec<u8, T::ProofMaxLen>) -> DispatchResult;

// Storage
pub type ExternalNullifier<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
```

Rate-Limiting Nullifier:
```rust
// Extrinsics
pub fn verify(origin: OriginFor<T>, proof: BoundedVec<u8, T::ProofMaxLen>) -> DispatchResult;

// Storage
pub type ExternalNullifier<T> = StorageValue<_, u32>;
```

Multiwriter Event Feed:
```rust
// Extrinsics
pub fn emit(origin: OriginFor<T>, message: BoundedVec<T::MessageMaxLength>, proof: BoundedVec<u8, T::ProofMaxLen>, relates_to: Option<T::EventId>) -> DispatchResult;

// Storage
pub type Events<T> = StorageValue<_, BoundedVec<Event, T::MaxEvents>>;
```

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
    - This solution consists of Substrate pallets which enable other substrate pallets to take advantage of unique properties of ZK technology.
        - Privacy
        - Anonymous rate-limiting

- Target audience:
    - Substrate or offchain application developers
- What need(s) does your project meet?
    - General Privacy features for Substrate chains
    - Missing rate-limiting features which are required for anonymous decentralized applications
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
    - Webb
  - If so, how is your project different?
      - Provides generic semaphore, meant to be easily accessible to other pallets, and is not tied to a particular application.
      - Focuses on Rate-limiting nullifier, which gives Semaphore and more features, such as rate-limiting, sybil resistance, or identifying users of anonymous protocols based on their behavior.
  - Manta
      - Manta provides anonymous transactions, but not generic solutions for other chains to use anonymous sets or anonymous rate-limiting.
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
      - The most similar are the original Semaphore and Rate Limiting nullifier projects(linked previously)
