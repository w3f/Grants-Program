## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### Background

With the development of Web3, more and more applications will be directly deployed on chain, or partially store business data on chain.  

These applications mainly use a front-end / back-end separation architecture, that is, the applications consist of a user interface and a backend built by smart contracts. In theory, any type of application can run on a network with smart contract functionality, but at the same time, these applications also need to compromise for the relatively scarce computing resources on the decentralized network and the high latency in processing business data.  

![WeTEE-To-Polkadot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wetee-dao/chain/main/docs/images/Grant/WeTEE-To-Polkadot?raw=true)

On the other hand, Web2 has a vast number of applications and a mature technology architecture system. When application developers migrate their Web2 applications to Web3, they are faced with challenges such as addressing the compatibility problem between application and chain, handling application deployment issues, dealing with privacy concerns regarding application business data, and figuring out how to update applications to fix security vulnerabilities.  

In a nutshell, the familiar Web2 application development and deployment paradigms currently lack viable alternatives in the Web3 domain. This gap will likely hinder the emergence of Web3 applications and delay the progression of the Web3 application market.  

#### Current Problems

- Web2 applications are typically deployed in a centralized manner, making business data prone to machine scanning.  
- After Web2 applications are adapted to smart contracts, there will be a significant performance overhead and they will face network congestion.  
- There is a risk of leakage of application business privacy data, resulting in financial losses for individuals and institutions.  
- Smart contracts have inherent limitations and face restrictions in supporting private data, GameFi, AI, metaverse, etc.  
- Web3 lacks software infrastructure similar to Web2, which cannot meet the diverse deployment requirements of Web3 applications.  

#### WeTEE Project

WeTEE is a decentralized application deployment platform integrated with a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).  

WeTEE consists of blockchain networks and multiple confidential computing clusters, collectively providing an efficient decentralised solution for confidential computing.  

Thread-level confidential container service providers need to provide hardware devices that support Intel SGX, and they are required to use IPv4 / IPv6 to access the Internet.  

1. At this stage, Substrate is mainly used as the blockchain framework to implement application deployment and billing-related smart contract functions.  
2. After the application is deployed, its workload will be safeguarded by hardware protection to prevent data leakage. Even confidential computing providers will not be able to access the data.  
3. It integrates with the existing cloud native toolchain for developers, typically requiring no code modifications, and in special cases, only a small amount of code modification is needed.  
4. Developers can view information such as the resource usage and health status of applications in the Web interface provided by WeTEE.

3. **Elastic Expansion:**  
    Equipped with the ability to sense application resource usage, it dynamically adjusts the application's resource quota according to preset policies.  
4. **Application Assurance:**  
    In the event of application failure detection, it will automatically handle the situation in accordance with the application emergency plan and attempt fault recovery.  

Currently, WeTEE's application management mechanism will use a democratic-centered governance mechanism similar to Polkadot OpenGov to govern the network.   

WeTEE replaces the board with DAO and uses a reputation voting system for on-chain decision-making, allowing more people to participate in the chain governance and thus promoting better community development. You can participate in or supervise the WeTEE project research and development, and alter chain parameters by voting.  

#### Technology Stack

![WeTEE-Technology-Stack](https://github.com/wetee-dao/chain/blob/main/docs/images/Grant/WeTEE-Technology-Stack.png?raw=true)

WeTEE implements a mainstream industry layered architecture design to accurately isolate on-chain and off-chain data, with a specific emphasis on optimizing the security storage strategy for off-chain data. The primary advantage of this layered architecture is its ability to determine the optimal storage and processing solutions for diverse types of data, guaranteeing data safety and privacy, and achieving efficient resource utilization and management.  

- **On-chain Core Data:**  
    Within this layered architecture, on-chain data primarily comprises essential transaction details and key state updates. With the non-alterable and decentralized characteristics of the blockchain, WeTEE ensures that all pertinent data is impeccably recorded on the blockchain, thereby enhancing the transparency of business processes in applications and offering key support to ensure data authenticity and completeness.  
- **Off-chain Data Encryption:**  
    Considering the storage needs of certain sensitive user data and a large amount of supplementary data, WeTEE has designed an encrypted storage solution for off-chain data. This encryption scheme employs hardware encryption techniques like Intel SGX / AMD SEV, ensuring that encrypted data retains integrity and offers error tolerance and recovery capabilities, significantly reducing the risk of data leakage.  
- **Data Access Control:**  
    Simultaneously, while sensitive data is encrypted, WeTEE also incorporates proof of data ownership and stringent data access control mechanisms. By utilizing refined data access control policies, unauthorized access can be effectively prevented, thereby further securing the safety of private data.  

Through the above design, WeTEE's layered architecture, using distributed storage and dynamic scaling technology, effectively reduces storage costs. At the same time, the strict access control and encryption techniques significantly minimize the risk of information leakage, achieving efficient and safe storage for off-chain blockchain data.  

### Ecosystem Fit

Within the existing Polkadot ecosystem, there is a discernible gap for requisite application deployment service platforms suited for Web 2.5. This gap is precisely where WeTEE presents its competence - by enabling application developers to expedite the development and deployment of diverse Web 2.5 applications. This accelerates the extension of Polkadot's application realms across a plethora of industries, notably within the sectors of social media, entertainment and finance.  

Web 2.5 applications play a pivotal role in attracting a broader spectrum of Web 2 users towards the growing Polkadot ecosystem. With the expansion of these user bases, Polkadot is not only gaining traction in numerical terms but it also represents a movement towards a more balanced and decentralized internet model.  

In addition, these Web 2.5 applications are potential catalysts for introducing a multitude of new commercial models in the Polkadot ecosystem. This can have a dual effect of fostering Polkadot's growth, as well as collaborating with traditional industries for shared advancements. As such, WeTEE's role in aiding application development projects is a substantial step towards increasing Polkadot's industry footprint.
