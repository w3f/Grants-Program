# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** SubIdentity
- **Team Name:** [TDSoftware](https://www.tdsoftware.de/)
- **Payment Address:** 0x8Db0972d9F40357526B879A002d60CCf6B4a8882
- **Level:** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in response to the [RFP: Substrate Identity Directory](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/identity-directory.md).

### Overview

SubIdentity is a fully client-side web application build with Vue.js in Typescript. The application enables searching of on-chain identities by any identity field in a substrate-based chain that implements the identity pallet. Search results are displayed in a list view. By choosing an identity from the list or providing the address of the on-chain account in a link, it is possible to right away see a human readable representation of the identity. A direct interaction with this account, such as sending tokens, is possible.

### Project Details

The project begins with a design and concept phase, which ensures that the greatest possible benefit is achieved with the application. SubIdentity will be component based, flexible and easily extendable. The responsive design ensures high accessibility on different devices such as mobile phones or desktop computers. The focus is on performance and usability to ensure the best possible user experience. The applications theme (color and branding) can be customized easily by configuring parameters. The final project phase includes manual and automated quality assurance (QA) with Selenium and the creation of unit tests.

#### Search View

The search view includes an input mask for the search term, the option to select a chain and to connect your own endpoint. After searching for the entered term, the list view is displayed.

#### List View

The list view displays all identities that the search parameter entered in the search mask matches any of their identity fields. Clicking on an identity in the list view takes the user to the detailed identity view.

#### Identity View

The detailed identity view contains available data of an on-chain identity in a beautiful card design that is adjustable. Cards can be closed and reordered as desired by the user. If provided, an avatar is displayed next to all metadata available in the identity entry. Tokens can be send from the detailed view directly to the on-chain account.

## Development Status :open_book:

[RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/identity-directory.md)

A concept and initial design was created as part of this application and can be found in the Project Details chapter.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3
- **Total Costs:** 49500 DAI

### Milestone 1 â€” Design and Implementation of the Basic Application

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  3
- **Costs:**  16500 DAI

A basic application with a responsive design is developed which supports querying by address and identity fields. A user can query identities from Polkadot or Kusama. When a search returns multiple results a list view is displayed. If there is only one search result or one identity is selected from the list view, a detailed identity view is displayed.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can use the application. |
| 0c.	| Testing |	Core functions will be covered by unit tests as far as reasonably applicable to ensure functionality and robustness. In the documentation, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 1. | Concept and design | We will create a high-fidelity, responsive, pixel perfect design for a search, a list view and a detailed identity view |  
| 2. | Implement logic for querying identities | Implement logic to receive identities from a substrate-based chain implementing the Identity pallet |
| 3. | Implement UI for search and list view | Build UI with Vue.js |  
| 4. | Implement UI for detailed identity view| Build UI with Vue.js | 

### Milestone 2 - Offline mode and performance improvement

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  3
- **Costs:** 16500 DAI

 A user can query identities from Polkadot, Kusama or provide his own node endpoint. The application can be hosted on IPFS and a backend is developed in order to improve performance.

## Future Plans

After we have provided a flexible, expandable and component-based application with the above-mentioned functions as part of milestones 1, 2 and 3, the development of further components as plugins could follow, as suggested in the [RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/substrate-identity-directory.md) in the Additional Plug-in Ideas chapter.
In addition, TDSoftware can undertake maintenance tasks as part of a maintenance grant.
