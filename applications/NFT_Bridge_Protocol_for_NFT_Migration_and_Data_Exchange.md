## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

This proposal is in response to Polkadot Bridge RFP.
### Overview

In this proposal, we use the following terms and definitions:   

* *NFT:* Intangible asset that is compatible with the ERC-721 standard (i.e. the unique intangible asset is abstracted from the concept of token, which is how the asset is represented on a blockchain). An NFT always exists in a world, which is itself in a universe.   

* *Universe* e.g. a blockchain or parachain, the Web2.0 internet, a private company’s database…   

* *World (within a universe)* e.g. a smart contract or smart contract ecosystem, a website, a private company project…   

* *Migration:* The movement of an NFT from an origin universe to a destination universe.   

* *IOU migration:* An NFT migration where the original token is put in escrow in the origin universe bridge, and a deed that allows the bearer to redeem that original token in the origin universe is created in the destination universe.   

* *Full migration:* An NFT migration which is handled by the publisher of the NFT, who controls the destination world, and thus can allow the NFT’s features and intellectual property rights to be transferred to the new token in the destination universe.   

* *Digital Rights Management:* The systematic approach to prevent unauthorized redistribution of digital rights and intellectual property rights infringement during a full NFT migration.   


The aim of this proposal is to explore and implement what information is sufficient and which are necessary to allow the migration of an NFT from an arbitrary universe to another. Both of the endpoints (origin universe/world and destination universe/world) must be ERC-721 compatible, but they do not have to be blockchains (e.g : domain name tokenization using an ERC-721 compatible API).

There are already Polkadot bridges under development for ERC-20 tokens and other arbitrary data. However, there is no consensus yet on how to bridge NFTs across chains. This project aim is to create a standard to do so at the messaging level.

Our team is building [myNFT.com](https://mynft.com), a marketplace for the world’s tokenized assets and we need this infrastructure for our marketplace to work effectively on the Polkadot Network. Previous to this we also developed [Cryptograph](https://cryptograph.com), an NFT publisher and marketplace on Ethereum.

### Project Details
The deliverable of this proposal is a process specification and it's implementation.

### Ecosystem Fit 
To our knowledge, there was no work being done on a standardized, universal bridge protocol for cross-chain NFT migration.

There were difficulties encountered during implementation, most of them stemming from technical limitations of the EVM and consensus protocols in general. Those include but are not limited to:      
-The limitation of the EVM to a reachable stack depth of 16 words, limiting the amount of data that can be processed without using SSTORE or other gas expensive tricks.    
-Making sure a relay, while trying to provide a better user experience, doesn't jump the gun and mint an IOU before he is sure he have control over the escrowed token.         
-Allow for relays to operate with a private key that could change over time for security reason, and high parallization of tasks without a single low gas transaction stalling their operations.     
   
This required multiple iterations of the code, many man hours, as well as in depth knowledge of the EVM/compilation process way beyond basic solidity coding abilities.     


### Milestone 3 — Testing and Documentation, User Guides. (COMPLETED)
* **Estimated Duration:** ~1 month
* **FTE:** 3
* **Work Days:** 21 days
**Cost per work day:** £300
* **Costs:** £6,300 (8464.24 USD/DAI)
* **Deliverable:** We wrote the standard and documentation for cross-universe migration, which includes “necessary” and “optional” data for optimization. This is a summarized write up of both the previous milestones but written as specifications for implementations, including the predicate and postulate of each message and what they mean in terms of state on the source and destination universe.

## Future Plans 🗺️
* Support for ERC1155
* **Blacklist for IOU
* Have built-in protections against “bad” migration by preventing migration to non-registered destination worlds.
* Allowing Polkadot parachains to migrate NFTs from one parachain to another using SPREE/XCM in a trustless manner.
* Perform Full migration (which requires Digital Rights Management at the bridge level).
* Trustless migration process formal specifications once a working implementation has been achieved (will only work within the same consensus sovereignty so between any polkadot parachain, for example). Current exploration done with RMRK. The process will consist of three main steps. The first step is to call the bridge contract and inform it about the migration. A hash is then emitted that needs to be signed by the owner of the NFT. The second step is to change the owner of the NFT by attributing it to the bridge contract. Finally, the third step is for the bridge to emit an escrow hash that also needs to be signed by the original owner of the NFT. That signature is sent to the arrival bridge, giving it the permission to mint an IOU token.


## Scope Update (Jan 2022) 🔍
* This scope is an updated version of an original grant proposal submitted in January 2021.

* A few weeks into the work of the grant, we realised that the milestones were a lot more intertwined than we envisaged, and that we needed to implement a full bridge + working relay in order to create a robust standard protocol and migration procedure. This turned out to be a lot more work but a great decision as it raised issues that earlier versions of the protocol didn't not take into account. We are now very confident in the robustness of the protocol, procedure and implementation we have built.

* We ran into EVM limitations (namely stack too deep) which had profound consequences on the UX and the "checked migration" vs "unchecked migration" process. The division of checked/trustless migration was deprecated because of gas cost/UX issue. Replaced with signature of owner + incentivisation of relay for IOU redemption to be signed before they mint the IOU. We realised that most of the demand for migrations is for IOU of NFTs to allow for higher liquidity, rather than Full Migrations. When publishers migrate NFTs, the commonly (and cheaper) accepted way of migrating projects is to burn the original token and re-mint on a new chain. Publishers often have their own, “closed garden” burn/minting process and as such have much less demand for a bridge system. Henceforth, the full migration was removed for the scope of the grant, and it has been moved to future plans which we intend on developing this feature once we have completed this grant. Because of the increase in complexity of the protocol, we decided to remove the ERC-1155 compatibility from the scope of this grant, but we also plan on developing this feature once we have completed this grant.

* To complete the updated scope of this grant, we had to bring in 3 extra people to the team due to the sheer scope of the necessary backend. The costs for Milestone 1 remained unchanged, the cost for Milestone 2 (originally encompassing milestones 2 & 3) increased fivefold, and the cost for milestone 3 increased slightly.
