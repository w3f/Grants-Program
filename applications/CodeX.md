- **Relation to Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama:** CodeX will utilize the Substrate framework to develop its infrastructure, encompassing features, consensus mechanisms, and a governance model. Prior to deployment on the Polkadot network, we will conduct thorough testing and experimentation on Kusama. Testing on Kusama allows us to validate the blockchain's performance and ensure compatibility within the Polkadot ecosystem. Upon successful testing, our blockchain will be deployed on the Polkadot network as a parachain, provided it aligns with our project's goals. Deploying as a parachain on Polkadot enables our blockchain to harness Polkadot's interoperability features and security. This approach enables us to leverage the advantages of both Substrate and Polkadot for development and deployment. Additionally, it allows us to take full advantage of Kusama's testing environment to guarantee that our blockchain functions as intended and seamlessly integrates within the broader network.
- **Why Your Team is Interested:** Our team is dedicated to achieving mass adoption in the blockchain space, with a focus on "no-code implementation" to make blockchain accessible to all, regardless of technical background. We believe in inclusivity, breaking down traditional barriers to blockchain participation.Our vision also includes embracing the multi-chain landscape, allowing users to deploy applications across various chains for flexibility. Security is paramount, and we've integrated advanced consensus mechanisms like Proof of Stake and Proof of Contribution to enhance security, scalability, and cost-effectiveness.In summary, our team is committed to democratizing blockchain, enabling multi-chain compatibility, and prioritizing security through advanced consensus mechanisms.
