Whether you&#x27;re a developer, investor, or simply a curious enthusiast, Awesome Polka provides a one-stop-shop for accessing comprehensive and detailed applications about the projects. With this cutting-edge platform, you can discover the latest updates and developments, connect with project owners, and stay up-to-date with the most innovative projects in the Polkadot community.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>Project showcase platforms face several challenges that hinder their effectiveness in promoting and highlighting various projects. The most significant challenges include sustainability and limited ecosystem partner (admins - authorized ones like someone from a DAO) authorities on the platform. These challenges significantly affect user experience and discourage project owners and ecosystem partners from utilizing the platforms fully. To address these issues, there is a need to develop innovative and user-centric strategies that enhance the functionality and sustainability of showcase platforms.</p><p>General overview of Awesome Polka:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40897846/223079422-f5d8a6bc-da20-4be8-a0a9-2f1f84f15795.png" alt="Awesome_Polka_Mindmap" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="problems">Problems<a href="#problems" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Problems" title="Direct link to Problems">​</a></h3><p>Let&#x27;s take a closer look at some of the issues of project showcase platforms that I have encountered: </p><p><strong>Sustainability</strong>: The long-term sustainability of a platform depends on its ability to consistently deliver value to its users. Manual updates to listed projects through forms and limited content control can result in outdated or inaccurate information, reducing user trust and engagement.</p><p><strong>UI &amp; UX</strong>: The user experience (UX) of a website or platform can significantly impact user engagement and satisfaction. Poorly designed UIs, slow loading times, confusing navigation, and other factors can all contribute to a low UX, hence reducing user engagement.</p><p><strong>Poor Search Algorithms</strong>: A platform showcasing tens of projects will require an effective search algorithm to help users easily find the specific project they are looking for. Weak search algorithms can result in irrelevant search results, leading to frustration and decreased user engagement.</p><p><strong>Static Project Pages</strong>: A project page should provide detailed information about the project, such as its objectives, methodology, team members, progress, and impact. A page that only includes a brief description can leave users with unanswered questions and reduce their interest in the project.</p><p><strong>Educational Materials &amp; Articles</strong>: For users interested in a particular project, educational materials and related articles can provide valuable context and additional information. Making these resources easy to find and linking them directly to the relevant project pages can enhance user engagement and interest.</p><p><strong>Ecosystem Partner Rights</strong>: Partnerships with DAOs or other ecosystem partners can bring significant benefits to a platform, such as increased visibility, funding, and community support. However, without proper rights and access, these partners may not be able to fully leverage their resources and expertise to help the platform grow and succeed.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="solutions">Solutions<a href="#solutions" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Solutions" title="Direct link to Solutions">​</a></h3><p>Awesome Polka is a social platform that aims to benefit the broader Polkadot developer ecosystem in several ways. Firstly, as Polkadot is one of the fastest-growing protocols, having a platform like Awesome Polka that aggregates all the projects in the ecosystem can help to further increase its size and diversity.</p><p>Additionally, Awesome Polka provides a fluent user experience that enables more people to stay informed about what&#x27;s happening on Polkadot. By making it easy to access detailed information about projects and events, Awesome Polka helps to promote collaboration and engagement among developers and enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Finally, the platform will be continually supported through Twitter sharing and events, ensuring that it remains a vibrant hub of activity within the Polkadot ecosystem. </p><p>Awesome Polka provides solutions to the problems mentioned in the previous statements in the following ways:</p><p><strong>Solution to Sustainability</strong></p><p>Awesome Polka has 2 personas for managing the platform: <strong>Project owners</strong> that want to publish their project on Awesome Polka, and <strong>ecosystem partners</strong> that is authorized ones like someone from a DAO, or from Polkadot team.  </p><p>Project owners can send a request to publish their project. After review and approval, they will receive login information to publish and edit their project&#x27;s page via their web3 wallets on a special dashboard. This enables project pages to be updated by project owners all the time and have unique dynamic pages.</p><p>On the other side, ecosystem partners can have admin access to Awesome Polka. They can approve or reject projects and request to remove any harmful content with an explanation. This allows ecosystem partners to help manage Awesome Polka and ensure that all projects are aligned with sustainability goals.</p><p>In summary, Awesome Polka provides a platform where project owners and ecosystem partners can work together to create long-term sustainable platform. By empowering project owners to create and manage their own projects and providing ecosystem partners with the tools to manage and monitor the platform, Awesome Polka helps to create a sustainable future for all.</p><p><strong>Improvement on UI &amp; UX</strong></p><p>Awesome Polka has a simple and effective user interface that makes it easy to navigate the website and find the information you are looking for. With just a few clicks, users can access general information and project details on the platform. The user interface has been designed to be fresh and cross-platform compatible, which ensures a seamless and enjoyable user experience regardless of the device or browser used.</p><p>The platform is continually undergoing UI developments to enhance the user experience further. At the final stage of development, the user interface will be fully responsible and optimized for all screen sizes, ensuring that users have a consistent and enjoyable experience across all devices. Overall, Awesome Polka prioritizes usability and user experience to create a platform that is both informative and easy to use.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="center">Home Page</th><th align="center">Projects Page</th><th align="center">Articles Page</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40897846/223079619-cd90d6e0-f406-4d0f-bfda-00126b4d41d5.png" alt="Awesome Polka Home Page" class="img_ev3q"></td><td align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40897846/223079640-0e47ab39-b667-4819-a20f-f1257449bf5c.png" alt="Awesome Polka Projects Page" class="img_ev3q"></td><td align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40897846/223079652-157a8c4e-a28f-40ea-9aa4-feadc5386e8d.png" alt="Awesome Polka Articles Page" class="img_ev3q"></td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Solution to Poor Search Algorithms</strong></p><p>Awesome Polka has a powerful search infrastructure that uses Algolia to deliver detailed and lightning-fast search results. </p><p>On Awesome Polka, category list exist to organize projects in detail. Ecosystem partners can add categories to this category list according to ecosystem needs, while project owners can select their category and subcategory while adding their project to the platform. Awesome Polka automatically integrates new categories into relevant pages to increase search efficiency.</p><p>Moreover, Awesome Polka&#x27;s search infrastructure uses a detailed searching matrix. Unlike most showcase platforms that only use titles to search for anything, Awesome Polka&#x27;s range of parameters is much wider, ranging from titles to project descriptions. This ensures that users can find what they are looking for more easily and with greater precision.</p><p>In summary, Awesome Polka&#x27;s search infrastructure is designed to provide a seamless and efficient user experience.
