## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
With the rapid development of public chain technology and ecology, more and more developers, technical communities and companies have begun to pay attention to entering the blockchain field, and try to gain their business through blockchain technology.
However, due to the relatively high technical threshold in the blockchain field, it is difficult for these groups to quickly and truly use blockchain technology to benefit their businesses.

In order to lower the technical threshold and allow more people to participate in the blockchain field, we proposed a low-code multi-chain smart contract development platform.
It is a platform that supports one-click parameterized deployment of standard smart contracts to different target public chains in a code-free manner.

### Overview

With the rapid development of public chain technology and ecology, more and more developers, technical communities and companies have begun to pay attention to entering the blockchain field, and try to gain their business through blockchain technology.
However, due to the relatively high technical threshold in the blockchain field, it is difficult for these groups to quickly and truly use blockchain technology to benefit their businesses.

In order to lower the technical threshold and allow more people to participate in the blockchain field, we proposed a low-code multi-chain smart contract development platform.
It is a platform that supports one-click parameterized deployment of standard smart contracts to different target public chains in a code-free manner.

### Project Details 

#### Architecture

The platform includes standard contract sets, on-chain deployers, multi-chain DApp, multi-chain SDK, platform open protocol, etc. The outline of the system architecture is shown below:  

![](https://seor.io/static/arch/overview.jpeg)  
    

* **Standard contract set:**  
A set of pre-defined parameterized standard contracts on the platform. It is implemented in different techniques such as Solidity, ink!, Python to support different public chain technology stacks.  

* **Smart contract deployer:**  
A set of smart contracts that do not belong to different public chains, but the centralized contracts of standard contracts will be deployed on different target chains through the deployer.  

* **Multi-chain DApp:**  
The platform carries all interactions and supports multiple public chains. Users can configure parameters, one-click deployment, and contract interaction through DApp.  

* **Multi-chain SDK:**  
A front-end library that supports the platform's interaction with different public chains, bridges the technical differences of different public chains, provides a unified interaction interface, and allows DApps to switch between different public chains for interaction at any time without recoding.  

* **Open platform:**  
Through standard protocols, other developers are allowed to access the platform, providing more users with multi-chain codeless access capabilities.  


#### Interaction preliminary design  
According to our preliminary assumptions, users can deploy contracts that meet their needs on the designated blockchain system in just two steps.
* Step1 - Through the smart contract market, choose the smart contract that meets the demand

* Step2 - Enter the required parameters to deploy

#### Advantages 

* Blockchain and smart contract technology can be used without contract coding, which reduces the threshold for using blockchain technology.  

* Hold a variety of blockchain technology architectures, without worrying about the underlying implementation, so that users of blockchain technology can focus on the business level.  

* Unify the blockchain access interface, smooth out the technical differences of heterogeneous block links, and implement a set of codes to access public chain systems with different technical architectures.  

#### Overall plan

We expect to implement a codeless smart contract platform that can support multiple chains through four phases.  
* Implement some popular standard parameterized multi-chain contracts, such as ERC20, ERC721, etc. At the same time complete the basic contract deployer, multi-chain support SDK and a multi-chain DApp that allows users to operate.  

* Add some standard parameterized contracts for complex businesses to the contract set, such as DEX business and liquid mining business. At the same time upgrade the supporting SDK and DApp.  

* Carry out business integration within the contract collection to enable some composite businesses to form a more complete business flow, such as one-click completion: ERC20 Token issuance + Token sales + DEX listing + liquidity mining mine. And upgrade the contract deployer, multi-chain DApp and other infrastructure.  

* Support more parallel chains and public chains that support smart contracts, upgrade SDK and DApp, and propose a complete standard access protocol to implement an open platform.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 95 days
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  3
* **Total Costs:** 12500 DAI

### Milestone 1 - Multi-chain smart contract set
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  3
* **Costs:** 5000 DAI

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | License | Apache License 2.0 |
| 2. | Contract set Repository | A git repository containing the source code of 4 contracts: parameterized ERC20, liquidity mining, contract deployer and Uniswap protocol connector. These smart contracts are all developed to realizes parameterized during deployment, not copy the standard contract such as ERC20 directly. All of contracts will be will be implemented using both solidity and ink! technologies. |
| 3. | Testing Guide | All contracts will have a proper unit-test coverage (min 80%) to ensure the robustness and safety of the contract. All of the test cases, test codes and test guide will be add to the repository. |
| 4. | Documentation | Related documents such as interface definitions, usage instructions, deployment tutorials, etc. of the contract set. These documents will be added to the git repository, and a pdf file download link will be provided on the project website. |
