## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

#### Background
It is clear to us that building a better, faster and cheaper Ethereum is not nearly enough. Just like Ethereum can do things Bitcoin can never do and subsequently inspired many new innovations, Substrate and Polkadot are categorically different from Ethereum that will empower many new types of innovations outside of the sandbox. 

On a domain-specific chain like the Acala chain, there're many domain specific runtime optimizations. For example, there’re DeFi primitives, liquidity and users that can be tapped into, there are also innovations that are simply not possible on Ethereum - customizable economic policy, for example Acala’s Flex-Fee allows users to pay transaction fee with any supported tokens; native cross-chain capability; on-chain governance apparatus (no more locked funds); full upgradability (no more contract migrations) and more.

We’d love to have all of these and EVM compatibility.

#### Current Solution

Current solution i.e. Frontier in principle is to emulate the Ethereum node experience. It aims to implement the full set of Ethereum RPC and emulates Ethereum block production process. This allows existing Ethereum tools such as Metamask and Remix to work with a Frontier enabled node seamlessly.

Integrating Frontier have revealed the following challenges by their severity:
1. Confined inside the EVM Sandbox (High): users will need to use a Substrate wallet (e.g. Polkadot-js Extension) and Metamask at the same time if they ever want to taste the real power of Acala, Substrate or Polkadot for that matter. This is certainly a deal-breaker for us. 
2. Making Nodes more Expensive (Medium-High): Substrate does not store transactions by hash nor historical events, nor does it provide any event filtering ability. Frontier injects special block importing logic, storing the transactions and events into an off-chain auxiliary store in order to power the query API required by Ethereum. This kind of goes against the goal to have a lightweight node to lower barriers for people from anywhere to run nodes which helps the network to be more decentralized. 

#### Our solution - Project Bodhi: Composable & Innovative Stack for EVM on Substrate
![solution](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1_tD0lZkvqbhrJNRW6aIVMV3AhBnBCBSz)

Project Bodhi offers these benefits
1. Full-stack composability: expose pallets API as EVM precompiled contracts 
2. Single-wallet experience: emulate full Ethereum JS SDK client (bodhi.js)
3. Lightweight while Queryable: Substrate node + Indexer node
4. Iterate fast with Typescript
5. Revamped EVM economics 

This solution can be very useful for any domain-specific chains that want to offer the full experience of runtime and Smart Contract.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

#### Details documentations of the project
- Project overview PPT [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CfEFz3a5hLN2R-G25E32wNFTENVwRtO3m2JHTf5KJZI/edit?usp=sharing)
- Project brief & plan [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iqkgei9RoXQnZlDp3IoSsnNDIylTCcBAB5RJJQeu0Ec/edit?usp=sharing)

#### PoC
We have completed a proof-of-concept to verify feasibility of the project [here](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/evm-provider)

#### Technology Stack
- The SDK (bodhi.js): this will be a new provider SDK which gets injected into existing web3.js, and wraps around polkadot-js to do Ethereum and Substrate translations (transactions, RPC calls, weights to gas etc.). Written in Typescript.
- The Substrate Node: implement additional RPC to interact with EVM
- The Indexer server: integrate it with bodhi.js, EVM event logging etc. Current implementation [here](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-web3.js/tree/master/packages/indexer) which both Laminar and Acala testnets have been using.

#### Scope
There are a lot of work involved to get all of these into a product-ready state, which is what we always aiming for, but it'd be too big to fit into one single open grant. Therefore we have carved out a scope specifically for this grant, followed by details for future work. 

**Grant Scope: Project Bodhi MVP**
The MVP scope involves 
- building all necessary components for ERC20 playground
- integrate with an existing Ethereum project that is reasonably sophisticated and requires us to build address mapping between Substrate & EVM addresses
- integrate with one existing Ethereum deployment tool e.g. Waffle

Future development
1. Expose [orml-currencies](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/currencies) precompiles to EVM
2. Expose [orml-nft](https://github.com/open-web3-stack/open-runtime-module-library/tree/master/nft) precompiles to EVM
3. Implement and integrate with Indexer Node
4. Integrate fully with Polkadot Extension
5. EVM economics: state renting, contract existential deposit, contract deployment economics
6. Replace Gas system with Weights system

### Ecosystem Fit 
Nope, if so we'd be more than happy to leverage it than build it ourselves.

## Future Plans
Our vision is to provide a composable and innovative stack for EVM on Substrate. We've seen the power of composibility in DeFi on Ethereum, and it's not limited to one domain. Meanwhile we also want to break-free from Ethereum constraints, and offer innovative economic models, fight scams, and improve usability. We're determined to make this next level unified experience happen on Substrate, through the the Project Bodhi stack. We are going to eat our own dog food to use it for Acala. And we believe it will be useful for most domain-specific parachains/parathreads who have custom runtime and also want to leverage smart contracts.
