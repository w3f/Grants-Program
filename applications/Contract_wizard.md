## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
​
The Polkadot Contract Wizard has successfully completed its initial phase, making it easier for users to create and deploy standard smart contracts on the Polkadot  ecosystem. In the next phase, we aim to expand the scope of the project by implementing additional features and supporting multiple chains. Our goal is to continue enhancing the user experience and versatility of the Polkadot Contract Wizard, making it a powerful tool for both developers and non-developers.
​
### Overview
​
In the next phase, we plan to implement the following features:
​
1.- Rename from Polkadot Contract Wizard to just Contract Wizard
​
2.- Interaction with deployed contracts through the wizard's UI.
​
3.- Interaction with smart contracts deployed by the user.
​
4.- Shareable Contract Interaction Links
​
5.- Support for multiple chains
​
6.- Create and publish videotutorials about how to use the tool
​
These enhancements will allow users to create, modify, deploy and interact with smart contracts on different parachains, making the Contract Wizard an indispensable tool for the community within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
​
### Project Details
​
#### <a name="step1"></a> 1. Rename from Polkadot Contract Wizard to be just Contract Wizard
We belive the naming is very important and we plan to cover the entire ecosystem, that's why we suggest to rename the tool to be Contract Wizard.
​
#### <a name="step2"></a> 2. Interact with deployed contracts
We will create a functionality that enables users to directly interact with their deployed contracts via the user interface of the wizard. This functionality will be generated dynamically according to the metadata of the contracts. With this, users will be able to conveniently and effectively manage their contracts and carry out interactions using the same tool.
​
#### <a name="step3"></a> 3. Interaction with custom smart contracts
Our platform will offer the capability to interact with any contract of their choice. To utilize this feature, they simply need to provide the metadata, network, and address associated with the contract. Once this information is ready, the user interface will automatically generate a customized user-friendly layout for allowing people to easily interact with their custom contracts. 
​
#### <a name="step4"></a> 4. Shareable Contract Interaction Links
To enhance the user experience and encourage collaboration, we plan to implement a feature for shareable contract interaction links.
Once a developer deploys a contract or uploads the metadata for interacting with it on our platform, they can generate a unique, shareable link. This link will contain all necessary information for interacting with the contract, essentially encapsulating the contract's ABI (Application Binary Interface) and its address on the blockchain.
Users receiving this link can interact with the contract directly, without needing to reupload the metadata or know the contract's specifics. This feature not only simplifies the process of contract interaction but also fosters collaboration and sharing within the developer community.
​
#### <a name="step5"></a> 5. Support for multiple chains 
This tool will offer a feature that enables users to connect to parachains implementing the contracts pallet. We will provide a list of some of these parachains in Polkadot, Kusama, and Rococo networks. Additionally, users will have the option to connect to a network that is not listed by specifying the web socket.
​
#### <a name="step6"></a> 6. Create and publish videoturials about how to use the tool 
To further support the community and enhance user adoption, we will create and publish a series of video tutorials that explain how to use the Contract Wizard effectively. These tutorials will cover various aspects of the tool, including creating and deploying standard contracts, interacting with deployed contracts, editing contracts within the interface, and connecting to multiple chains. By providing easy-to-understand, step-by-step video guides, we will make it even more accessible for users with different levels of technical expertise and contribute to the growth and success of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
​
Incorporating video tutorials will help to:
​
- Provide an alternative learning method for users who prefer visual demonstrations over written documentation.
- Enhance the understanding of the Polkadot Contract Wizard and its features by showcasing real-life examples and use cases.
- Reach a broader audience and encourage more people to engage with the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
- Strengthen the community by offering comprehensive resources that help users get started quickly and easily.
- Boost user confidence in using the tool, promoting greater adoption and utilization of the Polkadot Contract Wizard.
​
By creating and publishing video tutorials, we aim to further support the community and facilitate the adoption of the Polkadot Contract Wizard, making it an even more valuable resource for developers and non-developers alike.
​
### Ecosystem Fit
​
The Polkadot Contract Wizard aims to streamline the onboarding process and enhance usability within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
​
This project will contribute to the ecosystem in the following ways:
​
1. **Simplifying smart contract creation**: The Polkadot Contract Wizard will offer a user-friendly interface that allows individuals with varying levels of technical expertise to create smart contracts without the need for extensive programming knowledge. This will empower more people to participate in the ecosystem and explore the possibilities offered by smart contracts.
​
2. **Enhancing user experience**: By providing video tutorials, detailed documentation, and an intuitive interface, we will create a welcoming environment for new users, making it easier for them to get started with smart contracts on Polkadot and Kusama.
​
3. **Expanding the ecosystem's reach**: With the inclusion of multiple chains and custom contract creation, the Polkadot Contract Wizard will cater to a broader audience, encouraging more projects and developers to join the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
​
4. **Encouraging community growth and collaboration**: By offering comprehensive support and resources, we aim to foster a strong, collaborative community around the Polkadot Contract Wizard, encouraging users to share their experiences, contribute to the project, and help one another succeed.
​
5. **Driving innovation and adoption**: By simplifying the process of working with smart contracts, we hope to inspire more users to experiment with new ideas and solutions, driving innovation and adoption within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem.
