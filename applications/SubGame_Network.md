# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** SubGame Network
* **Team Name:** SubGame
* **Payment Address:** 14eKFGCjESvx63jouJXrpWQRoMw9kGacMN

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Overview
#### Introduction
SubGame is a decentralized game platform. There are a large number of game templates running on the platform, so that participants can quickly start the game. The NPOS consensus mechanism is adopted to ensure the fairness of the entire platform. After the mainnet is launched, community autonomy allows the entire ecosystem Cycle forward.
SubGame will also provide a friendly game front end, allowing players to enjoy the joy of the game.
#### Integration
SubGame is based on the Substrate 2.0 Framework. Substrate's powerful non-fork upgrade solution will provide more help to the changing game platform. We will also use OCW to introduce more game random factors. SubGame will serve as a parachain , To provide more possibilities for the entire Polkadot ecology
#### Team Interest
All members of the team are convinced that blockchain will change the world, and have been working hard to create more transparent rules of the game. We have been observing and learning Substrate technology for more than a year. From the current point of view, substrate is our best choice.
### Project Details 
#### Architecture
The SubGame project contains SubName Node, Game Template Library, Gamee Chips, Game Center and Front End.
![modules](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SubGame-Network/graphics/main/subgame-core-modules.png)
* **SubGame Node** is the customized chain node for SubGame network build by Substrate 2.0 ,it contains the basic functionalities as a normal chain node but also provides the ability to fetch external data needed for games with the OCW (Off-chain Worker) from Substrate 2.0 Framework.
* **SubGame Token $SGT** is the native token of the SubGame Network, and it will play the role of governance and other utilities. **$SGT** like **$DOT**
* **Game Chips:** is one of the core modules of SubGame, mainly including chip purchase, redemption and income distribution.
* **Game Template Library** is an ever-increasing library of game templates, and new game additions continue to increase through public chain upgrades.
* **Game Center** stores all game instances and player data. It is the data center of the entire platform
* **Front End** will adapt to the basic game front end to ensure a friendly user experience

### Ecosystem Fit 
At present, there is no real decentralized game platform, but more decentralized games. Unlike the past, this time we are going to build a truly decentralized game ecological platform.
