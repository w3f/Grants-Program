## Project Overview

It’s the first application of DeTech.World to the Grants Program


### Overview

DeTech.World is a Web3 startup focused on creating an all-in-one infrastructure for technology assets as a new asset class. Our goal is to make technology assets liquid and to facilitate the sound technology transfer and monetization processes even in early tech development phases. We do this by introducing multi-chain IP-NFTs and custom IP-NFT marketplaces to showcase unique portfolios of DAOs, research hubs, or any corporate tech R&D.

According to ARK Invest, we will face a $210T cap for disruptive technology by 2030. We want to be at the forefront of making them liquid! By analogy, we build a sort of “Ebay for disruptive technologies and DeSci”. 

Our Web3 platforms enable features that blur the line between investing and innovating, such as trust-enabled showcasing technology assets, instant IP protection, IP-NFTs, custom IP-NFT marketplaces, new forms of collaboration and co-creation, AI based tech assessment, matching investors and innovations, and providing novel funding, monetization, licensing, and DeFi tools for a new class of assets: Tech Assets. 

Thus, we would like to drive the introduction of the DeSci segment within the Polkadot ecosystem. 

Initially, we’ve built our platforms based on Graphene blockchain and now would like to implement Substrate based pallets for the introduction of DeTech service logic and platform, firstly on Kusama following with a Polkadot parachain. In this approach we are focusing on delivering technology show-casing, co-creation, IP assessment and early stage research funding tools for the DeSci community and growing number of technological DAOs.  

We would like to introduce a DeSci segment within the Polkadot ecosystem and to be the first Polkadot all-in-one platform for DeSci applications and to support numerous technology DAOs with our technology show-casing, co-creation, tech IP assessment, IP-NFTs and funding DeTech tools. We also would like to introduce custom IP NFT marketplaces to feature technology DAOs portfolios in a unique way which will strengthen the DeSci community. 

Moreover, we target a multi-chain approach and thus would like to utilize XCM and XCMP for our DeSci applications. 

In fact, we have already implemented a variety of features for the technology transfer process and tested the product idea on TTOs. So we have realized that for keeping delivery fast and being flexible we need to enhance our DLT solution. That's why we look at Substrate as a cutting-edge framework for fast delivery. And we believe that Decentralized science is a segment that could enrich the Polkadot ecosystem to attract new users and to increase adoption.

#### Architecture and overview of common interfaces 
Each portal has following elements:

- **Client** - Platform UI that can sign blockchain transactions and have an integration with Polkadot wallets to identify Users on the portal.
- **Server** - Back-end part of application. Applies some business logic + Communicate with Blockchain and Database to fetch/store data.
- **Substrate node** - DApp that runs base business logic and contains DeSci pallets.

[![photo-2023-03-02-12-55-37.jpg](https://i.postimg.cc/FzHgmZHr/photo-2023-03-02-12-55-37.jpg)](https://postimg.cc/dkgTjGCp)

Common interfaces:

- Main Blockchain validator - Substrate validator that provided telemetry/analytics/transactions for explorer.
- Transaction explorer - Custom transaction explorer for the DeSci applications.
- MongoDB - Offchain data storage.
- Stores sensitive data like users personal data
- Stores read models
- File Storage - S3 storage to hold NFT files and other content related to technology.

Sensitive data protection:

- As we build an application for EU countries we have to apply GDPR. To apply GDPR we will store User personal data in a Database that will be hosted in the EU region (Mongo Atlas). MongoDB already has an encryption mechanism: no one without a security key has no access to the database data.
- Also it will store legal and other sensitive content on MongoDB.
- Public project and technology data and references will store on ipfs/s3 and on-chain within related metadata.


#### Data Model

### Ecosystem Fit

We would like to introduce the DeSci segment within the Polkadot ecosystem and to enable an all-in-one DeTech platform as a parachain for DeSci organizations and tech DAOs. We also would like to make use of XCM and XCMP for the multi-chain framework. 

Our target audience is: DeSci community, technology DAOs, research Hubs, Tech Transfer Offices, tech investors, NFT marketplaces

There are no similar projects in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem. Thus, we would like to introduce the DeSci segment within the ecosystem.

### Project Motivation

DeTech.World is a DLT platform that enables liquidity of Technology Assets, from ideation to commercialization, enhances technologies commercialization process and creates a new class of assets – Synthetic Tech Assets. 

Tech assets refer to any intangible technology-based resources and technological innovations such as know-how inventions, scientific creations, proprietary algorithms, unique design, frameworks or any other kind of intellectual property (IP).

**Tech transfer challenges**

There are several potential ways to address the challenges facing technology transfer today. 

One potential solution is to develop a more comprehensive and standardized process for technology transfer, including clear guidelines and resources for innovators to help them navigate the process and find the right partners.

Another potential solution is to provide increased access to funding and investment for early-stage technology projects. This could include the development of new financing mechanisms, such as crowdfunding platforms, to help innovators secure the resources they need to develop their ideas.

Additionally, reducing barriers to entry in the technology transfer market, such as simplifying intellectual property laws and increasing education and awareness among potential partners about the value of new technologies, could help improve the technology transfer process.

Finally, improving communication and collaboration among different stakeholders in the technology transfer process, including innovators, investors, and potential partners, could help bring new technologies to market more quickly and effectively. This could involve the development of new platforms and tools to facilitate communication and collaboration among these stakeholders.

|     7. | Monitoring and enforcement                  | It is important to monitor and enforce the IP rights to ensure that the IP is being used and commercialized as intended.                                                                                                                                            | Digital identification of IP allows to use analytics and dashboards for monitoring IP usage, Hash IP verifications of evidence of ownership are available to 3rd parties                           |

From DeTech.World perspective, most important and relevant Web 3.0 features are:
- Immutability, traceability, security and auditability of all transactions
- Time-stamping of all transactions
- Tokenization of high-value Tech Assets in form of F-NFT and DeFi instruments
- Creation of DAOs as new-gen communities owning & driving Tech projects development
- Collateralization of IP for underlying Tech Assets to issue stable coins, early loans
- Staking of DeTech tokens to yield farm on the most profitable technology segments

### Market Fit

In today's knowledge age, corporate assets are increasingly dominated by intangible assets. Right now, roughly 90% of assets in S&P 500 companies are intangible, a trend that will only keep growing. An intangible asset is an identifiable, non-monetary asset that lacks physical substance. 

[![Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-15-43-15.png](https://i.postimg.cc/Gm9tPYVD/Screenshot-2023-02-15-at-15-43-15.png)](https://postimg.cc/87QTNF1k)

The primary characteristics of such assets is that it’s based on contractual or legal rights.

From another side, due to the valley of Innovation Death hinders many disruptive technologies to reach a commercialization phase.

In the nutshell, there are three main areas we would like to focus on:

### Product Idea and Goals

We guess that the reasons why the current legal and IP system are unable to make tech assets liquid are the following:
- **No Value:** the value of technology assets is not established and unknown to the market.
- **Bad Portability:** it’s a cumbersome process to transfer technology asset ownership.
- **No Ways to Exchange:** there’s no fast and secure way to trade technology assets.

On the other hand, non-fungible tokens (NFTs), or cryptoassets representing proof of title to a unique digital version of an underlying asset provide a fast and secure way to exchange. In the sports and digital arts sectors, recent NFT issuances have sold out in seconds, netting their creators millions. And the idea of DeTech.World is to provide a technical solution based on NFTs as an IP metadata container with multichain compatibility and opportunity to use DeFi tools and list assets to marketplaces.

The goals of the our product are the following:	
1. Enhance capability of IP showcasing using up-to-date cryptography methods.
2. Boost experts' collaboration via economics incentives and DAO mechanism.
3. Enable quick investment decisions and add value to Tech Assets by creating statistical models of assessment.
4. Provide tools for making liquid of any Tech IP.


Generally, NFTs are available and traded globally because DLT platforms operate beyond borders. And it allows to create a multiply effect for distributing Tech Assets as a new class of tradeable liquidity.

The actors or user segments of DeTech.World:
- **Inventor** - creator of the Technology, owner of IP;
- **Expert** - contributor to the Technology, who provides expert opinion and makes assessment of the technology;
- **Investor** - the trader of NFT or consumer of IP.
