## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in response to the [anti-collusion infrastructure RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Open/anti-collusion_infrastructure.md).

### Overview

Helping to empower the realization of trust in, and verification of, voting systems within Substrate parachains.

The goal of this proposal is to provide a minimum viable implementation of Vitalik Buterin’s [“Minimal Anti-Collusion Infrastructure”](https://ethresear.ch/t/minimal-anti-collusion-infrastructure/5413) as a substrate pallet and CLI (for performing off-chain work,  i.e. encrypting votes, processing messages, and generating proofs). 

The scope of this proposal is intended to be a proof of concept, of which contributes to the development of a genuine *minimal* anti-collusion infrastructure within the Substrate ecosystem. 

Governance, and by extension voting systems, are critical facets of society at large and have become a crucial value proposition of many blockchain applications. It is therefore imperative to develop systems which not only promote a sense of underlying trust, but also can intrinsically verify their own integrity.

The team is interested in cryptographic voting as a research domain. They would like to further explore this area in order to provide a meaningful contribution to the community. Refer to “Future Plans” section to preview how we’d like to see this project evolve.

### Project Details

There are two primary deliverables outlined in this proposal: 

1. A Substrate pallet which facilitates the voting apparatus and on-chain verification of poll results, and;

2. A CLI tool to facilitate the generation of arguments passed to the methods exposed by the pallet. 
 
The goal of this system is to deincentivize collusion between participants given that any participant can secretly change or nullify their vote.

<ins>Deliverables:</ins>

1. Substrate pallet
    1. Description
        1. Facilitates transparency and provenance of poll interactions and outcome. Users can register as either coordinators or participants, create polls, and interact with polls. On-chain verification of zero-knowledge proofs (which have been generated off-chain) that establish the correctness of the poll tallying computations (which have been performed off-chain) must occur prior to the acceptance of, and publishing of poll outcome. 
    2. Public methods 
        1. `registerAsCoordinator` Permits the caller to create polls, and stores their (public) keys. 
        2. `rotateKeys` Permits a coordinator to rotate their keys used for verification and voting process. Rejected if called during an ongoing poll.
        3. `registerAsParticipant` Permits a user to participate in a poll. Rejected if called after voting period. 
        4. `createPoll` Instantiates a new poll object with the caller as the designated coordinator. Emits an event with the poll data.
        5. `interactWithPoll` Inserts a message into the message tree for future processing by the coordinator. Valid messages include: a vote, and a key rotation. Rejected if sent outside of the timeline specified by the poll config. Participants may secretly call this method (i.e. from a different address) to override their vote, thereby deincentivizing bribery.
        6. `mergePollState` Used by the coordinator to compute roots of message state tree, which is used as a commitment value by the proof verification logic. Rejected if called prior to poll end.
        7. `commitOutcome` Verifies batches of proofs corresponding to the correctness of message processing and vote tally in order. Once every proof has been successfully verified the outcome is committed to storage and a `PollOutcome` event is emitted containing the result of the vote. Rejected if called prior to `mergePollState`.
    3. Runtime storage 
        1. Public key store: mapping between coordinators and their public keys (which are used by participants to encrypt their votes)
        2. Verifying key store: mapping between coordinators and their verifying keys used in the on-chain verification of proofs
        3. Poll store: mapping between poll id and the current state of the poll
        4. Poll message state: mapping between poll id and a merkle tree of secret participant messages (i.e. votes and/or nullifiers)
        5. Poll Result: mapping between poll id and outcome
    4. Dependencies
        1. We will rely on the [Groth16](https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/260.pdf) verifier provided by [bellman](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman/blob/main/src/groth16/verifier.rs) under the [MIT license](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bellman/blob/main/LICENSE-MIT).
2. CLI tool
    1. Description
        1. Facilitates off-chain computations performed by participants and trusted operators. In particular, generating the values (e.g. encryption keys, proofs) required by the function signatures specified in the first deliverable (1.Susbtrate Pallet). This will be provided as a TypeScript library (in order to serve as a starting point for future integration into dApps) with a simple CLI wrapper.
    2. Technologies used
        1. Circom
        2. Typescript 
        3. Node.js
        4. snarkjs
    3. Commands available to users 
        1. `generateKeypair` Used by both participants and coordinator. Outputs a keypair used for encrypting and decrypting the messages which represent poll interactions. 
        2. `generateProof` Used by the coordinator. Generates a proof of correctness for the current batch of message processing computations (including final vote tally).
        3. `encodeMessage` Used by participants. Accepts their vote as input, and outputs an encoded message which may only be decrypted and read by the coordinator.


<ins>Poll lifecycle:</ins>

1. Poll is created (by a coordinator). Prior to the start time of the poll:
    1. The coordinator may perform any permitted alterations to the poll configuration, or close the poll
    2. Individuals can begin to register as participants in the poll
2. Poll starts:
    1. Coordinator may no longer preform any alterations to the poll (e.g. update signing key) 
    2. Participants may interact with the poll (vote, revote, nullify vote, switch keys) 
3. Poll ends:
    1. Participants may no longer sign up or interact with the poll
    2. Coordinator may start to compute the outcome of the poll
4. Poll result becomes “finalized” once:
    1. The coordinator publishes the result of the poll alongside proofs of the computations
    2. The result of the poll is committed to storage if and only if every proof passes verification
    3. At this point it is sensible for external actions to be taken in response to the outcome of the poll

<ins>Constraints and limitations of the deliverables to be aware of:</ins>

- A coordinator may only manage a single poll at a time (there may be multiple coordinators each with their own poll at any given time)
- Users can only cast a vote of weight 1
- Votes must be processed, and tallied, in batches
- Non-transparent proof system (Groth16); requires a trusted setup

We intend to improve upon these limitations in future work (see the section below).

### Ecosystem Fit

- Useful in governance schemes, e.g. crowd funding applications.
- The target audience is parachain developers, e.g. a candidate integration could be the [imbue network](https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue).
- The overall intended trajectory is to help establish a sense of integrity within democratized systems. Participants in these systems are empowered to verify by default.
- The team is not aware of any projects in the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama which are currently attempting to achieve feature parity (or beyond) with MACI in the Ethereum ecosystem.

## Future Plans

1. Experimentation with alternative architectures 
    1. In particular, we are interested in architectures which support on-chain tallying utilizing partial or fully homomorphic encryption, and verifiable computation schemes such as [Rinnochio](https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/322.pdf?ref=blog.icme.io). 
    2. Secure multi-party computation architecture which relies on multiple coordinators; this would enable complete secrecy of individual voter preferences. Ideally this would be combined with (1.i).
2. Features and enhancements to deliverables
    1. Integration of transparent zk-SNARKS
    2. Reduce number of extrinsic calls required in the tallying phase, e.g. with [Nova](https://github.com/microsoft/Nova)
    3. Support for different voting schemes, e.g. quadratic, ranked choice
3. Additional systems and example integrations
    1. Off-chain worker (and potentially a backend service) to automatically perform the message processing, tallying, and proof generation computations
    2. dApp which provides a rich user interface for creating and participating in polls
    3. Example ink! smart contract demonstrating how to interface with the pallet, e.g. a fungible-token contract wherein the voting power of a single participant corresponds to the number of tokens they own
4. Outreach 
    1. Obtain a security audit of infrastructure
    2. Network with faculty and peers with the aim of collaborating on research goals
    3. Seek out possible integrations with a parachain, e.g. [imbue](https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue)

Where appropriate, we would like to deliver some subset of these in follow up proposals.
