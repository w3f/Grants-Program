### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).

: Candy Mint
- A brief description of your project.

: Candy Mint is a tool built for Asset Hub for building scalable nft mint dapps built with the use polkadot-js/api and react-js
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

: Candy Mint is Deployed with the use of React-js and @polkadot/api within Aseet Hubs of Polkadot and Kusama
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

: We're intrested in building this project because the new Asset Hub parachain provides multiple different functionalities for nfts like public minting of nfts which can be very useful when it comes to the deployment of mint dapp without writing smart contract we all have tried ethereum based nft mint dapps so we wanted to build the same thing on Polkadot-Asset-Hub with some extra functionality

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components

: ![Candy Mint UI](https://github.com/AshutoshSingh00001/Grants-Program/assets/138657449/90790d44-b115-4917-b8b2-562a5c2d5e82)

- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

: @polkadot/api for nft mint by the user and for setting minted nft metadata and chain state for identifying next item id
- An overview of the technology stack to be used

: React-js + @polkadot/api + firebase (firebase will be replaced by polkadot chain state fetch api for collection next item id data)
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

: ![Components](https://github.com/AshutoshSingh00001/Grants-Program/assets/138657449/d5a0bd0a-f121-4f5d-abfb-984298cedc26)

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

: ![poc](https://github.com/AshutoshSingh00001/Grants-Program/assets/138657449/87319be8-2ea3-4493-9581-a1376b348bbc)
- What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
: public mint , free mint , whitelist mint , content metadata revealable after mint


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):

- The (future) tokenomics of your project
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

: on Asse Hub for Creating nft mint dapps easily with different functionality
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

: developers , artits
- What need(s) does your project meet?

: Pre built Tools for nfts
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?

: Kodadot Drops but it cannot be customised and dosent supports different mint functionality plus Mint dapp page creation isn't quick you'll need to submit form to host mint
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
