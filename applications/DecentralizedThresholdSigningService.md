## Project Description :page_facing_up:

### General Overview

This project is a continuation of [this one](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2250) and aims to build a decentralized threshold signing service leveraging the Olaf protocol. The service will operate off-chain, providing a secure and cost-effective alternative to on-chain threshold signature mechanisms within the Substrate/Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem.

### Technical Details

Each participant in the threshold signing group will run a dedicated node application. This application will include:

- Core Threshold Signing Protocol: The service will use the Olaf threshold signature protocol, which was implemented in the previous grant.

- Peer-to-peer networking via [`rust-libp2p`](https://github.com/libp2p/rust-libp2p) (Milestone 1):

    - Peer discovery: nodes will identify and discover each other through a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) that maps their Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama public addresses to their peer IDs.

    - Secure communication: [`libp2p_noise`](https://docs.rs/libp2p-noise/latest/libp2p_noise/) provides secure, authenticated channels between participating nodes for exchanging protocol messages.

- Integration of the Olaf protocol with the underlying network (Milestone 2), managing:
    - Distributed Key Generation (DKG) and signing rounds.

    - Local storage of key shares and protocol state.

- A Command Line Interface (Milestone 3) that allow users to:

    - Configure node settings (network addresses and peer IDs).
    
    - Configure protocol settings (threshold and number of participants).
    
    - Execute the Olaf protocol.

### Ecosystem Fit

This project is useful for any Substrate/Kusama/Polkadot based project that wants to use a secure off-chain decentralized threshold signature service that is cheaper than using the theshold signing funcionality of the network directly.

## Future Plans

- Develop a webwallet for the user interface or integrate it in an established webwallet of the ecosystem, if there is interest.
