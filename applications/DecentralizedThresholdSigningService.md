## Project Description :page_facing_up:

### General Overview

This project is a continuation of [this one](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/2250) and aims to build a decentralized threshold signing service leveraging the Olaf protocol. The service will operate off-chain, providing a secure and cost-effective alternative to on-chain threshold signature mechanisms within the Substrate/Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem.

### Technical Details

Each participant in the threshold signing group will run a browser-based application that performs decentralized key generation and signing operations through the Olaf threshold signature protocol, compiled to WebAssembly (WASM). The networking layer is built using JavaScript and `libp2p` for peer discovery and communication.

#### üåê Networking Layer (JavaScript)

##### Transport
- Peers connect to a relay server using WebSockets.

##### Discovery
- When a peer connects, it sends its Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama address to the relay server.
- The relay server assigns the peer a random `libp2p` Peer ID and stores the mapping:  
Address ‚Üí Peer ID

- Peers can query the relay server with a known blockchain address to obtain the corresponding Peer ID.

##### Direct Peer Communication
- Once a Peer ID is obtained, the peer establishes a WebRTC connection using `libp2p`.
- All protocol messages are exchanged via this secure, direct P2P channel.

#### üîê Cryptographic Protocol (Rust ‚Üí WASM)

The cryptographic logic is written in Rust and compiled to WebAssembly (WASM) for browser use.

##### Core Functionality
- Distributed Key Generation (DKG) to derive a shared threshold public key.
- Threshold Signing for signing Substrate/Kusama/Polkadot extrinsics.

##### State Management
- Key shares and protocol state are stored in browser-local storage (e.g., `IndexedDB`).

### Ecosystem Fit

This project is useful for any Substrate/Kusama/Polkadot based project that wants to use a secure off-chain decentralized threshold signature service that is cheaper than using the theshold signing funcionality of the network directly.

## Future Plans

Build a production-ready, secure Progressive Web App (PWA) that includes:
- Robust asynchronous peer-to-peer communication.
- Support for configurable t-out-of-n threshold schemes.
- Add proof of ownership to prevent address spoofing.
- Implement a network of relay servers to achieve full decentralization.
