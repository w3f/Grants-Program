on October of 2022 with a practical case study within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>The following excerpt is from SydTek&#x27;s study on Bit.Country entitled &quot;The Metaverse as the Digital Leviathan: A Case Study of Bit. Country&quot;. This provides a primer to the proposed study.</p><p>The What?</p><p>Older Americans have stockpiled nearly $35 trillion USD over the last few decades and, as a result, contribute up to 27% of all wealth in the United States. Researchers have argued that the time may have come to give this wealth away to the next generation, thereby marking the beginning of “The Great Wealth Transfer.” Kraken, a United States-based cryptocurrency exchange and bank, estimates that Millennials (ages 24 to 39) and Generation Xers (ages 40 to 55) could drive over $1 trillion USD of wealth into cryptocurrencies over the next 25 years as both generations embrace the inherent value of the emerging blockchain technology. While many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have recognized this monetary revolution throughout the past decade, far less have discussed the crucial economic factor that sustains wealth over generations: inheritance, or, in this case, digital inheritance. </p><p>Digital inheritance emerged from the convergence of three previously separate worlds: wealth management, estate planning, and digital assets. Here, a digital asset is stored digitally, is uniquely identifiable, and has some value, such as cryptocurrencies and NFTs. So naturally, one of the central questions surrounding an individual’s digital assets will relate to digital inheritance: How will individuals pass their cryptocurrencies and NFTs onto their beneficiaries once they pass away? This brings us to a foreseeable rise in digital asset executors, who will be responsible for administering an individual’s last will and testament once they pass away and ensure that their digital assets are appropriately distributed to the relevant beneficiaries through, for example, smart contracts on the blockchain.</p><p>Despite the rise of digital asset executors, it would appear that, from a legal point of view, various challenges remain in the way of digital inheritance as being a reliable form of transmitting wealth across generations. For example, in the absence of a private key to an ancestor’s digital wallet, it is neither feasible nor productive to attempt to prove the existence of digital rights through tracing of electronic correspondences, analyses of banking operations, or entries in the registry of rights that reflect transactions with objects certified by tokens. This is where the exploration of the application of soulbound tokens (SBTs) and the Social Recovery Pallet within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems may be a proposed solution.</p><p>The Why?</p><p>In a 2020 study by the Cremation Institute, 89% of crypto investors worry about dying with their assets, while only 23% of those have a documented plan. Of that percentage, only 7% have created a will that includes cryptocurrencies. In another survey, roughly 60% of Americans and over 65% of Canadians do not have a will. It was also noted that these numbers could be higher in other parts of the world. This can be attributed to the terror management theory (TMT) and people&#x27;s fear of dying. We conducted a theoretical case study on soulbound tokens and TMT that can be found here <a href="https://bit.ly/3RnCmMy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3RnCmMy</a> that investigates the possibility of how the introduction of SBTs could alleviate the anxiety and fear of death. Although this use case may be unconventional, it is one that all Web3 users may have to face in their lives.</p><p>The How?</p><p>This proposal is for the creation of a peer-reviewed academic case study for the application of soulbound tokens within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems by leveraging the Social Recovery pallet and soulbound token use cases developed by the Phala Network and RMRK for digital inheritance. This will be a qualitative case study where we will conduct a literature review of soulbound tokens, as well as interview team members and developers of Phala - Marvin Tong, Joshua Waller, and Wenfeng Wang - as well as team members from RMRK. In addition to the research on soulbound tokens, we will also interview Parity Technologies members who are familiar with the development of the Social Recovery pallet to investigate how it can be applied to digital inheritance.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:</p><ul><li>Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?</li></ul><p>As of September of 2022, there are 1.05 million holders of DOT tokens and over 267,000 holders of KSM tokens. In addition to these numbers, many others hold tokens from projects throughout the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. With these numbers, users throughout the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems could benefit from this study as not only will this study bring awareness to the importance of digital inheritance and the Social Recovery Pallet, but this study could also create cross-chain solutions that would bring users from other ecosystems to leverage this offering.</p><ul><li>Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp&#x27;s userbase, yourself)?</li></ul><p>The target audience for this study would be developers to create a solution for digital inheritance through the use of the Social Recovery Pallet, as well as dapp users. We are in initial discussions with Intentionally Designed Solutions - <a href="https://ids.company/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://ids.company/</a> - an organization we have worked with in the post to create a proof of concept in a future proposal if this proposal is accepted. Additionally, as highlighted in the Future Plans section below, a follow-up study is planned with Law Professors to investigate the legal components of digital inheritance within the Web3 space.</p><ul><li>What need(s) does your project meet?</li></ul><p>As the number will grow exponentially in the coming years, this project meets the current need of 320 million identity-verified crypto and Web3 users globally. With the issue of verifiable proof of assets such as land in emerging economies such as Africa, there is also a social impact component to this study where NFTs could provide verifiable ownership of physical assets. </p><ul><li>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?</li></ul><p>Although there are research-based projects that have received grants from the Web3 Foundation, after a quick search, the team was unable to find a study focused on digital inheritance and the Social Recovery Pallet within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.</p><ul><li>If so, how is your project different?</li></ul><p>N/A</p><ul><li>If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?</li></ul><p>Two projects outside the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems offer digital inheritance solutions - Vault12 and Safe Haven. For Vault12, although users can store crypto and NFTs, at the current state, the Vault12 solution is only for Ethereum-based assets. For SafeHaven&#x27;s Inheriti product, the website notes only 350+ users, which leads to the question of can this solution support ecosystems the size of Polkadot and Kusama?</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Justin Goldston, PhD</li><li>Justyna Osowska</li><li>Jordi Chaffer</li><li>Suyeon Han</li><li>Assune Cotlage</li><li>Joshua Waller</li><li>Charles von Goins II</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Justin Goldston, PhD</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:justin.goldston@sydtek.ai" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">justin.goldston@sydtek.ai</a> </li><li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://sydtek.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sydtek.ai/</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> SydTek is a registered LLC in the state of Maryland in the United States</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>Dr. Justin Goldston - Justin Goldston is a Professor at Penn State University, as well as a Visiting Professor and Graduate Advisory Board Member at Georgetown University and the University of Southern California.

Also most people are probably not aware that this already exists on kusama.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-roadmap-">Development Roadmap 🔩<a href="#development-roadmap-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Roadmap 🔩" title="Direct link to Development Roadmap 🔩">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview-1">Overview<a href="#overview-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Total Estimated Duration:</strong> 4 months</li><li><strong>Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):</strong>  5FTE, the listed members would contribute to different deliverables based on their skill-set.</li><li><strong>Total Costs:</strong> 29,600 USDC </li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="milestone-1--state-of-the-industry-on-soulbound-tokens-and-digital-inheritance">Milestone 1 — State of the Industry on soulbound tokens and digital inheritance<a href="#milestone-1--state-of-the-industry-on-soulbound-tokens-and-digital-inheritance" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Milestone 1 — State of the Industry on soulbound tokens and digital inheritance" title="Direct link to Milestone 1 — State of the Industry on soulbound tokens and digital inheritance">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Estimated duration:</strong> 1 month</li><li><strong>FTE:</strong>  5</li><li><strong>Costs:</strong> 15,600 USDC - link to budget details outlined in the Additional Information Section</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th align="right">Number</th><th>Deliverable</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">0.</td><td>Rights</td><td>All developed materials and raw data will be publicly accessible and public domain via a GitHub repository.

After the dissemination of the foundational case study for soulbound tokens and the Social Recovery pallet at institutions and university blockchain clubs globally, we have plans to conduct follow-up research with law students and academic researchers in the field of Law on the potential legal impacts of soulbound tokens on estate law. As Justin Goldston is an Graduate Advisory Board Member at Georgetown University, Law Professors at Georgetown are curious about the impact of NFTs within the legal practice. Additionally, after a presentation for faculty members from the Smeal College of Business and the Dickinson School of Law at Penn State University, which can be seen here <a href="https://bit.ly/3AQiH0C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/3AQiH0C</a> on sustainable impacts of the metaverse, Professors from the Dickinson School of Law are also looking to conduct research on NFTs, the metaverse, and law. After the completion and publishing of the original article, the team looks to conduct a follow-up study of the legal impacts of soulbound tokens. Next, we also look to continue to work with the team at Phala to build out a proof of concept with Intentionally Designed Solutions for the Kusama ecosystem with hope that this concept could be moved to Polkadot once the Social Recovery pallet is available on Polkadot. To continue the awareness of the Social Recovery pallet and the proposed digital inheritance tool, we mentioned the concept to Ray Lu - the Founder of Bit.Country - and we hope to introduce this tool within the Bit.Country metaverse within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. Finally, with the recent annoucement that the Klaytn blockchain has developed a strategic partnership with Parity, in an effort to demonstrate the interoperability of Substrate, we will also work with Neo Yiu and Dr. Sangmin Seo on integrating the proposed solution into the Klaytn metaverse.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="additional-information-">Additional Information ➕<a href="#additional-information-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Additional Information ➕" title="Direct link to Additional Information ➕">​</a></h2><p><strong>How did you hear about the Grants Program?</strong> Webinar by David Hawig and David suggested we look into the Social Recovery pallet and SBTs within the Kusama ecosystems via email.</p><p><strong>Milestone budget breakdown</strong>
