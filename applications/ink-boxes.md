## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Ink boxes are a collection of helpful Ink smart contract boilerplates along with it's frontend. It will already have polkadot.js library using which frontend can talk with the smart contract deployed. Got inspired by truffle boxes on how easily one can spin up the boilerplate code in no time.

### Ecosystem Fit
 - Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Anyone who wants to quickly spin up boilerplate can use our platform.
 - Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Anyone who wants to create Smart Contracts on top of Ink are our target users.


### User Journey
 - User visits Ink boxes website.
 - User selects the dApp they want to download.
 - User will be able to download the entire dApp code in zip format.
 - Contributors can also submit a new dApp if it is fit for the substrate ecosystem. They need to provide the GitHub repo link for the ink box.
