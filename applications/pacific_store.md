## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

When it comes to the rise of crypto collectables, it’s no surprise that many secondary markets have arisen for the exchange of these unique assets.

For those unfamiliar with non-fungible tokens (better known as NFTs), they are tokens which are unique from one another due to special characteristics or identifiers which distinguish them from others in a similar set.

Specifically within DeFi, we’ve seen NFTs play a role in the tokenization of assets and contracts alike, all of which play a larger role in the notion of composability – or different products interacting with one another towards a larger ecosystem.

In this overview, we’ll dive into PacificStore – an industry-leading decentralized exchange (DEX) for NFTs built on Polkadot/Kusama.

PacificStore is an open-sourced crypto collectible marketplace which allows users to trade popular tokens built on interoperable standards like .

Prior to PacificStore, there was no easy way to trade crypto collectables other than brokering over-the-counter (OTC) deals – a situation which invokes a large amount of trust and counterparty risk.

With PacificStore, users can bid directly for items owned by other users, with assets being exchanged instantaneously in the event the seller accepts a bid or a buyer accepts an offer.

While there are a number of other crypto collectible marketplaces on the market, PacificStore currently leads as the defacto choice for swapping NFTs.

Perhaps one of the more novel aspects is the “Rankings” feed which allows users to see which platforms and collectables are most in-demand at any given time.

How Does it Work?
To get started with PacificStore, simply connect a wallet and over to the “Browse” tab.

The application automatically scans your wallet for any collectables you may have, along with the assets needed (like DOT/KSM) to purchase items off the marketplace.

When interacting with listed items, users will have the option to either enter an offer – assuming no price has been set by the seller – or accept the listed price similar to eBay’s “Buy it Now” feature.

When placing an offer, be sure to take note of what asset the offer is being placed in (DOT, KSM, etc.) as it can vary from item to item.
Once an offer has been placed, users will receive an email if their purchase is successful.
On the selling side of things, simply click Account in the top right then “My Items” and choose the item you wish to sell.
Here you will have the ability to select the price and duration of the sale along with the type of offering it is.

Listing is free, and upon the successful sale of items, PacificStore will take a 2.5% fee on the final sale price.

### An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

PacificStore is a decentralized exchange platform. It will have three high-level components.

- A Parachain on Polkadot for bringing liquidity from Polkadot’s interoperability community.

### An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

We are amused by the PacificStore of centralized institutions cropping up around the decentralized idea of open, peer to peer, programmable internet of value. Decentralized Exchanges are built on the idea of non-custodial interoperability. Polkadot and Substrate are the most promising blockchain interoperability platforms. We want to provide our users with maximum liquidity, security, and world-class user experience. Hence, we are excited and confident that building a DEX on Substrate, supported by Polkadot’s interoperability, will increase user engagement and overall trading experience when combined with our trading expertise over the years.

### Project Details

- PacificStore Storefront
- PacificStore White-label
- PacificStore SDK
- Instant set-up
- Customizable
- Fixed-price selling
- Dutch auctions
- Bid-based auctions
- Gifting
- Bundles
- Gas-free listings
- Revenue share
- Referral / affiliate program
- Custom domain
- Full control over customization

1. The most advanced marketplace feature set
   PacificStore's platform provides the most powerful way for your users to buy and sell their items—auctioning, bidding, bundling, you name it. All developers get instantaneous access to our suite of marketplace features:
1. Product Listing Items can be sold at a set price or gifted
1. Dutch Auctions Item's price can fluctuate up or down in a set timeframe
1. Item Bidding eBay-style Bidding Auction your items to the highest bidder
1. Bundle Sales Items can be sold in groups

#### Time-tested, audited smart contracts

PacificStore is powered by the Protocol, a set of robust Polkadot/Kusama smart contracts specifically designed for buying and selling unique digital assets. The smart contracts are security audited and have been used in production with high-volume games. You won't need to deploy any additional smart contracts (other than your contract) in order for your items to be instantly tradeable with our SDK.

#### Full customizability

You can tailor your marketplace exactly how you want it. Whether you're building with our instant PacificStore Storefront solution, on your own domain with our white-labeled integration, or with a DIY approach using the PacificStore SDK, you'll be able to get the exact look and feel you want for your marketplace experience.

#### Exposure on the largest decentralized marketplace

Thousands of users are already browsing PacificStore to discover the best-priced items. When you build your own PacificStore marketplace, your items will be instantly cross-listed onto the general PacificStore marketplace for discovery.

By using PacificStore, you plug directly into this liquidity pool and truly allow the market for your items to thrive.

#### Earn revenue from secondary sales

Every time a user sells an item, they pay a fee — a percentage of the price it was sold. When you host a marketplace on PacificStore, you get a piece of this fee. With increased volume and increased exposure, this makes using PacificStore substantially preferable to building an isolated marketplace.

You can take a very small cut to encourage more trading, or a larger cut to try to maximize revenue.
The process is simple — simply specify the percentage fee you wish to take on secondary sales and an address to which the funds will be paid. To learn more about setting your fees, check out our docs.

#### Host your initial item sale on PacificStore

Many of our partners also host their initial item sales on PacificStore. This can be done entirely on the PacificStore platform, and is detailed in the PacificStore Crowd Sale Tutorial.

#### PacificStore SDK

Build your own marketplace on PacificStore, using our SDK

Want to build your own integration on top of PacificStore? Check out our SDK for the underlying toolset that allows you to power your in-game marketplace with our platform.

With the SDK, developers can build your own marketplace from scratch and integrate it more deeply in your game. Perhaps you're building a custom backend for your game and want to create trades server-side, or perhaps you need people to be able to create auctions in a deep area of gameplay. The sky is really the limit with the SDK.

#### PacificStore frontend portal

Get up and running today with a customizable PacificStore integration

The simplest way to leverage PacificStore is through the PacificStore Storefront feature. As long as your contract is stardard compliant, this option works instantly. Just follow the PacificStore developer tutorial to set up your items and get an instant marketplace for your items. Developers have called the process "magical".

##### Instant buying and selling

With the PacificStore storefront, your items are instantly tradeable through PacificStore's platform. This means that your users will be able to immediately sell items without paying gas, bid on items, sell bundles of items, and gift them to other users. You get all of this for free!

##### Pricing

Not only is PacificStore storefront feature entirely free, but it comes with the additional benefit that every single secondary sale on PacificStore earns you revenue! You can set your fee in the storefront editor.

#### PacificStore White-label

Run an PacificStore marketplace on your own domain, fully customized to your brand

##### SUGGEST EDITS

For partners who want a more customized marketplace integrated directly into their website or mobile app, we provide a white-labelled solution. Check out our repo for how to embed your marketplace directly into your site using an iFrame

Full customization, on your own domain or app
PacificStore white-label allows you to customize the look and feel of your main marketplace page, as well as each individual listing. Host the marketplace directly on your domain, directly accessible for your users from your in-game experience, or allow users to leverage the experience directly in your mobile application.

##### Choose your own economics

Allow users to buy and sell in your own token, and place the necessary restrictions on how items can be traded in the PacificStore experience. PacificStore offers full support for custom ERC20 tokens, and includes built-in affiliate incentive programs to encourage users to find buyers for your items.

##### PacificStore Crowd Sale

Run the crowd sale for your items on PacificStore

The PacificStore Crowd Sale integration allows you to run a crowd sale for your items entirely using the PacificStore infrastructure. If you're looking to distribute ownership of items in your game, or new items in an existing game, our tools maximize exposure to the crypto gaming community and provide robust infrastructure for auctioning items.

#### PacificStore Basic Integration

Integrate an existing mainnet project into PacificStore

##### SUGGEST EDITS

This page is designed for developers who have already written their contract and wish to integrate it with PacificStore. However, if you're starting fresh, we recommend following the official PacificStore Developer Tutorial.

Viewing your existing items on PacificStore
Good news! If you've deployed your contract on the Polkadot/Kusama mainnet, your items are already tradeable on PacificStore. Just go to our listing flow to view your storefront.

#### Metadata Standards

How to add rich metadata to your NFTs

Providing asset metadata allows applications like PacificStore to pull in rich data for digital assets and easily display them in-app. Digital assets on a given smart contract are typically represented solely by a unique identifier (e.g., the token_id ), so metadata allows these assets to have additional properies, such as a name, description, and image.

##### Implementing token URI

For PacificStore to pull in off-chain metadata for assets, your contract will need to return a URI where we can find the metadata. To find this URI, we use the tokenURI method and the uri method . First, let's look closely at the tokenURI method in the Creature contract.

The tokenURI function or the uri function in your contract should return an HTTP or IPFS URL When queried, this URL should in turn return a JSON blob of data with the metadata for your token. You can see an example of a simple Python server for serving metadata in the PacificStore creatures repo here.

If you use IPFS to host your metadata, your URL should be in the format ipfs://ipfs/<hash>.

##### Metadata structure

PacificStore supports metadata that is structured according to the official metadata standard or the Enjin Metadata suggestions.

Additionally, we support several other properties that allow for multimedia attachments -- including audio, video, and 3D models -- plus interactive traits for your items, giving you all the sorting and filtering capabilities on the PacificStore marketplace.

1. image This is the URL to the image of the item. Can be just about any type of image (including SVGs, which will be cached into PNGs by PacificStore, and even MP4s), and can be IPFS URLs or paths. We recommend using a 350 x 350 image.
2. image_data Raw SVG image data, if you want to generate images on the fly (not recommended). Only use this if you're not including the image parameter.
3. external_url This is the URL that will appear below the asset's image on PacificStore and will allow users to leave PacificStore and view the item on your site.
4. description A human readable description of the item. Markdown is supported.
5. name Name of the item.
6. attributes These are the attributes for the item, which will show up on the PacificStore page for the item. (see below)
7. background_color Background color of the item on PacificStore. Must be a six-character hexadecimal without a pre-pended #.
8. animation_url A URL to a multi-media attachment for the item. The file extensions GLTF, GLB, WEBM, MP4, M4V, OGV, and OGG are supported, along with the audio-only extensions MP3, WAV, and OGA.

##### Attributes

To give your items a little more pizazz, we also allow you to add custom "attributes" to your metadata that will show up underneath each of your assets. For example, here are the attributes for one of the PacificStore creatures.

To generate those attributes, the following array of attributes was included in the metadata:

Here trait_type is the name of the trait, value is the value of the trait, and display_type is a field indicating how you would like it to be displayed. For string traits, you don't have to worry about display_type.

##### Numeric Traits

For numeric traits, PacificStore currently supports three different options, number (lower right in the image below), boost_percentage (lower left in the image above), and boost_number (similar to boost_percentage but doesn't show a percent sign). If you pass in a value that's a number and you don't set a display_type, the trait will appear in the Rankings section (top right in the image above).

Adding an optional max_value sets a ceiling for a numerical trait's possible values. It defaults to the maximum that PacificStore has seen so far on the assets on your contract. If you set a max_value, make sure not to pass in a higher value.

##### Date Traits

PacificStore also supports a date display_type. Traits of this type will appear in the right column near "Rankings" and "Stats." Pass in a unix timestamp as the value.

If you don't want to have a trait_type for a particular trait, you can include just a value in the trait and it will be set as a generic property.

We also support the Enjin Metadata style.

While we advise against storing metadata on chain, if you decide that it's important for your use case, contact us at support@PacificStore.io and we'll get back to you with questions and next steps.

##### Attribute guidelines

A couple important notes when coming up with your attributes! You should include string attributes as strings (remember the quotes), and numeric properties as either floats or integers so that PacificStore can display them appropriately. String properties should be human-readable strings.

##### Deploying your metadata API

You're welcome to deploy your metadata API however you see fit: you can host it on IPFS, cloud storage, or your own servers. To get you started, we've created a sample API server in both Python and NodeJS:

##### Python&NodeJS example API server

We'll create a tutorial on building and deploying your metadata server to Heroku soon.

##### Storing on IPFS

If you plan to store on IPFS, we recommend Pinata for easily storing data in IPFS.

##### Contract-level metadata

Customizing the metadata for your smart contract

- SUGGEST EDITS
  You can add a contractURI method to your contract that returns a URL for the storefront-level metadata for your contract.

- Text
  This URL should return data of the JSON format:
  JSON

```
{
  "name": "",
  "description": "",
  "image": "g",
  "external_link": ""
}
```

### Ecosystem Fit
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
To the best of our knowledge, there is no project working on creating collectables NFTs in Polkadot. There are some existing projects that create NFTs in Ethereum ( OpenSea etc.). 

PacificStore will make it to mint and transfer collectables NFTs in Polkadot/Kusama. It aims to close the gap and enable more business use cases for collectables NFTs in Polkadot ecosystems.

PacificStore is deeply committed to web3 and our stack is focussed firmly on helping make it simple for developers to bring truly decentralized applications, online autonomy and new business models to users. Adding the ability to interface with parachains, as a bridge to the Polkadot ecosystem opens up a world of financial and other tools to those developers, and provides developers working in or interested in the Polkadot ecosystem a fast simple way to get started. collectables NFT in Defi is the perfect proving ground for this.

Main diffiences:
* Support Chinese
* Base on Polkadot/Kusama
* Build smartcontract parachain
