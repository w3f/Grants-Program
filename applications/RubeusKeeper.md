## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
This application is not in response to an RFP, but it fully complies with a potentially interesting project “Sign-in with your Polkadot, Kusama, etc. account” mentioned in [Open Source Polkadot Stack](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source) page in the “ browser extensions” section.

### Overview

Remembering passwords from all resources is a challenging task. It doesn’t need any introduction as all Internet users use passwords dozen times a day. The most common, but less reliable way of password managing is using the only password for all resources – not a good idea, but true. The other one, next most popular – using password managers built in your browser. Quite reliable for low critical data, but for privacy critical data this is not the way to store passwords as there are several ways for third parties to obtain passwords from these centralized systems. Users that value privacy usually use offline desktop applications for managing passwords – it’s safe, but has disadvantages as different devices won’t sync, so one has to manage them separately.

The aim of this project is to develop a decentralized password manager that stores data in a blockchain and uses personal Polkadot wallet credentials to access the passwords manager dApp. Saved passwords will be added automatically to appropriate forms on websites after logging in with user’s wallet private key in the browser extension.

### Project Details

The Rubeus Keeper dApp will consist of two functional modules:
1.	An Ink! smart contract for seсure password storage using a Polkadot or Kusama account. Just log in to your Polkadot wallet and get access to your passwords DB. The smart contract will includes methods for writing and getting passwords, as well as categorizing.
2.	A browser extension for password managing: registration, log in, password generation, categorizing, saving, retrieving, autocomplete functionality.

Under this MVP we consider security in the next attack vectors:
 1. Transferred data unauthorized interception and decryption (categories, URLs/logins, passwords).
 2. Malicious data substitution by a node.
To solve the above mentioned tasks the data will be encrypted using the ChaCha20-Poly1305 streaming algorithm with message authentication. The protocol is standardized by IETF in RFC 7539, in software implementations it is much more efficient and faster than AES.

### Ecosystem Fit

The Rubeus Keeper dApp will be used by all the community and even all Internet users as it simplifies and secures daily interaction with web applications – web2 or web3 – our dApp will be comprehensively useful. The target audience is “a web user”.

In the [Open Source Polkadot Stack](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source) we see the [Logion network]( https://github.com/logion-network/logion-node) project, that represents a separate parachain with very wide functionality. Unlike Logion we offer a simple Ink! contract and an extension that can be used in any Substrate based parachain with no need for setting nodes and etc. Fast, easy and no need for a separate wallet.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

We plan to execute 2 deliverables in two milestones:
- an Ink! smart contract for password storage;
- a browser extension for password management (tested under Chrome browser).

The project will be supported by a team of 2 developers, 1 UI/UX designer, 1 DevOps engineer and 1 QA.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2,5 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 30,000 USDT

### Milestone 1 — Design and development of a smart-contract and a testing page

- **Estimated Duration:** 1,5 months
- **FTE:**  2 FTE
- **Costs:** 22,000 USDT

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
