# Homebase - Real Estate Tokenization Protocol on Polkadot

> This is an application for a Level 3 grant to build a comprehensive real estate tokenization protocol native to the Polkadot ecosystem.

- **Team Name:** Homebase by HanPay  
- **Payment Details:**
  - **DOT**: 13QrJsxfwEabrYuDAjQfuEt1iFPJdxWERRVUkAuLbGSv6og8 (≥50% of total grant)
  - **Payment**: TX5tekNYLZXaVtje6QUMKjEsx9RxteSzC4 (USDC) - TRC-20 Address
- **Level:** 3  

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- **Tagline:** Bridging physical real estate and DeFi through trustless tokenization on Polkadot
- **Brief Description:** Homebase is a Polkadot-native RWA protocol that enables fractional ownership, liquidity, and programmable governance of real estate assets through tokenization, cross-chain integration via XCM, and compliant on-chain trading.
- **Polkadot Integration:** Built as a custom Substrate parachain with specialized pallets for RWA management, utilizing XCM for cross-chain liquidity and governance across the Polkadot ecosystem.
- **Team Interest:** Real estate represents the world's largest asset class (~$280 trillion globally) but remains illiquid and inaccessible. We aim to democratize real estate investment while showcasing Polkadot's capabilities for complex real-world asset management.

```

**Core Components:**

1. **Substrate Runtime Pallets:**
   - `pallet_rwa_core`: Property registration, metadata management, IPFS document storage
   - `pallet_rwa_asset`: Fractional token minting, supply management, ownership tracking
   - `pallet_rwa_marketplace`: On-chain order book, trading, settlement mechanisms
   - `pallet_rwa_xcm`: Cross-chain asset transfers and governance via XCM
   - `pallet_rwa_governance`: Token-weighted voting, proposal management

2. **Backend Services (Node.js/Express):**
   - REST and GraphQL APIs for frontend integration
   - KYC/AML compliance management
   - Event streaming from Substrate chain
   - Admin dashboard for property onboarding
   - Integration with legal custodians and notaries

3. **Frontend Application (React/TypeScript):**
   - User dashboard for asset management
   - Property browsing and investment interface
   - Governance participation tools
   - Multi-wallet support (Polkadot.js, Talisman, SubWallet)

**Technology Stack:**
- **Blockchain:** Substrate framework, Rust programming language
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Polkadot.js API
- **Storage:** IPFS for document storage, on-chain metadata
- **DevOps:** Docker, GitHub Actions, Prometheus, Grafana

**Data Models:**

Property Registration:
```rust
pub struct Property {
    pub id: PropertyId,
    pub owner: AccountId,
    pub metadata_hash: Hash, // IPFS hash
    pub valuation: Balance,
    pub legal_documents: Vec<Hash>,
    pub status: PropertyStatus,
    pub token_supply: Balance,
    pub created_at: BlockNumber,
}
```

Fractional Token:
```rust
pub struct PropertyToken {
    pub property_id: PropertyId,
    pub total_supply: Balance,
    pub circulating_supply: Balance,
    pub holders: BTreeMap<AccountId, Balance>,
    pub trading_enabled: bool,
}
```

**What the project provides:**
- Trustless real estate tokenization infrastructure
- Cross-chain liquidity for real estate assets
- Compliant governance and trading mechanisms
- Integration with existing legal frameworks

**What the project does NOT provide:**
- Direct property management services
- Legal custody of physical assets (handled by partners)
- Traditional real estate brokerage services
- Guaranteed returns or investment advice

### Ecosystem Fit

**Position in Polkadot Ecosystem:**
Homebase fills a critical gap as the first dedicated real estate RWA parachain in Polkadot, providing:
- Specialized infrastructure for real estate tokenization
- XCM integration enabling cross-chain DeFi access for real estate assets
- A bridge between traditional finance and Web3 for institutional adoption

**Target Audience:**
- Primary: Real estate investors seeking fractional ownership and liquidity
- Secondary: DeFi protocols wanting exposure to real estate assets
- Tertiary: Property developers seeking alternative funding mechanisms

**Market Need:**
The global real estate tokenization market is projected to reach $3.7 trillion by 2030 (according to Boston Consulting Group, 2021). Current pain points include:
- Lack of liquidity in real estate investments
- High barriers to entry (minimum investment requirements)
- Limited geographic diversification options
- Complex legal frameworks requiring specialized solutions

**Evidence of Need:**
- 40+ inquiries from potential users during our testnet phase
- Interest from 3 property management companies in Nigeria and Serbia
- Positive feedback from real estate lawyers regarding our compliance approach

**Similar Projects Analysis:**
- **In Polkadot Ecosystem:** No direct competitors focusing specifically on real estate RWA
- **Other Ecosystems:** RealT (Ethereum), Lofty (Algorand) - our differentiators include:
  - Native cross-chain capabilities via XCM
  - More flexible governance mechanisms
  - Lower transaction costs through Substrate optimization
  - Better regulatory compliance tools
