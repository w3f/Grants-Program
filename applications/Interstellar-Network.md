## Project Overview :page_facing_up:



### Overview


“The blockchain ecosystem needs an easy to use interface with hardware wallet security to reach the mass market.”
 
The main pain points of non-custodial wallet solutions still are:
- **User experience**  [Can an easy to set-up wallet be an efficient customer acquisition tool for DeFi players?](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/can-be-an-easy-to-set-up-wallet-an-efficient-customer-acquisition-tool-for-defi-players-8600812fe01e)  
- **Security** [Are cryptocurrency wallets more at risk than ever?](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/are-cryptocurrency-wallets-more-at-risk-than-ever-cf1ce9725de7) 

> We think that current wallet solutions slow down the DeFi adoption.


Interstellar is a novel non-custodial peace of mind mobile wallet with a hardware security level. Based on a Substrate blockchain and SubstraTEE/IntegriTEE workers.

**We can now provide the same hardware security level as hardware wallets with only a mobile and a blockchain**

**Thanks to Trusted User Interface TUI on mobile and Trusted Execution Environment on both mobile and blockchain nodes**

Because TUI is not yet avalaible on all mobile devices we use a Garbled Circuit/Visual Cryptography scheme which provides an alternative that will be complementary down the road to mitigate potential flaws in TUI.

#### Features:
- **Hardware security Level** - TEE on nodes and mobiles (incl. TUI), garbled circuits and visual cryptography secure interface
- **Just download an app** - no registration, PIN, password, passphrase, private key or any secret to store or remember
- **Multichain Wallet** - securely store and interact with native cryptocurrency coins and tokens from multiple blockchains
- **Confirm a transaction with ONLY ONE SCREEN** - no SMS to wait for, no additional 2FA app to use, no QR code to scan

- **Up to 1,000,000 tps** - no tps limit due to slow consensus, thanks to IntegriTEE layer 2 based on hardware enclave technology 
- **Social Recovery Service** - leverages the existing Substrate pallet and a novel decentralized autonomous recovery service 
> We hope that we will be able to provide a response to the related RFP in the following phases
- **Features to securely send coins with social network messages (even to persons with no-wallet)** - explained in [Can an easy to set-up wallet be an efficient customer acquisition tool for DeFi players?](https://medium.com/@jlleleu/can-be-an-easy-to-set-up-wallet-an-efficient-customer-acquisition-tool-for-defi-players-8600812fe01e) 


#### Our solution is designed to support blockchain and DeFi mass market adoption with:

- **A decentralized key & asset management service** where the user’s privates keys and signature programs are stored and executed in TEE nodes
- **A decentralized Trusted Transaction Validation protocol** that leverages TEE and TUI features on mobile, combined with One Time Garbled Circuits and Visual Cryptography to provide a **Trusted Authentication and Trusted UI layer** on user devices





The **Interstellar - Wallet Phase 1** W3F Grant Proposal focuses on two of the core components of the Interstellar solution: 

- A Substrate Off-Chain Worker OCW Garbled Circuit Factory GCF to manage an external garbled circuit generator service (designed to be used by Substrate developers regardless of the Interstellar solution)
- An implementation of the Trusted Transaction Validation protocol in Substrate pallets to demonstrate the usage of GCF within a Substrate framework and with a mobile  Garbled Circuit evaluator client

Following are other use cases of the Garbled Circuit Factory:

- Every schemes  based on Garbled Circuit generators and evaluators
- Multi Party Computation MPC protocol (when Oblivious Transfer OT will be managed in pallets)
- Proof of history of legitimate computation with reusable Garbled Circuit (Interstellar ongoing research: Detection of adverse code execution during short transaction sessions - work in progress)
- Post Quantum encryption and signature scheme implementations (NIST candidate examples)


### Project Details


#### [Detailed documentation](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RTPx4EeA0Ek33f-8_Dj7p-qjzBp6VqLrrXNhIrwvFWI/edit?usp=sharing) on the project

- **OCW Garbled Circuit Factory**
- **Transaction Validation protocol pallets (including mobile registry)**
  - **Transaction Validation Screen Technology (Trusted/Secure UI)**
  - **Mobile client GC evaluator** 




#### Garbled Circuit Factory **previous work**
The team has already developed a strong authentication solution with circuits based on JustGarble implementation https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/groups/justgarble/ that we customized with Free XOR and Half Gates and other specific improvements for our needs (pre-computation of our Visual Cryptography Circuits).
We achieved a production ready platform with significant performance on the logic circuit and garbled circuit production with AES-NI. The whole pipeline uses optimized memory management and avoids serialization/deserialization of the different circuit formats: HDL->non-garbled->garbled.

### Ecosystem Fit

> Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

This project is the first phase of a wallet project. Although, we think that our Trusted Transaction Validation protocol could bring a novel approach to address UX/UI security issues regardless of other features of our frictionless wallet.
We designed our validation transaction protocol to benefit to other wallets or Dapps. We think it could also be complementary down the road to mobile light clients like Substrate Connect (check **Future Plans** section).

>Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

We want to target Dapp providers in the DeFi ecosystem with developer tools to integrate our solution with their Dapps. We think that our value proposition should be attractive to them.
At the same time we want to target newcomers with a Robinhood wallet for Defi that includes an average dollar cost feature.
> What need(s) does your project meet?

The need for a wallet to be simpler to set-up and use, as well as the need for higher security to address the growing malware/banking trojan threats.

> Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

Math Wallet and Gluon are close to our solution.

We think that we could bring a better user experience, security and performance, thanks to a highly scalable layer 2 based on SubstraTEE: 

- Math Wallet is based on MPC that requires heavier computation resources. They also envision smartcards with a screen for their users. It's comparable to our level of security, but more expensive, cumbersome to use, less flexible and more complex to deploy than our solution.
 
- Gluon QR code based transaction confirmation that requires 2 screens is more cumbersome for the user. Moreover, this scheme is already exposed to banking trojans with overlay capabilities*. Although their TPM based approach could be complementary down the road to TEE, to mitigate potential future flaws on Intel SGX.

## Future Plans



>How we intend to use, enhance, promote and support your project in the short term:

- We aim to create a user community and get in talks with Dapp and especially DeFi players with a tailored value proposition for them
- Game Theory inspired Tokenomics paper
  - Continuous Liquidity Pool (native cross-chain swaps)
  - Seignorage
  - Quadratic Voting
 

- Wallet MVP launch with basic features including Social Recovery and Key management service (potential following grant application submissions)

- Garbled Circuit Evaluator in WASM to enable its use on browser and nodes - Transaction Validation variants on browsers
- Improvement of our Visual Cryptography scheme by reintroducing full Visual Cryptography frames to display characters, figures and images. This should increase the complexity, cost and resources required for an attack
- Potential research grant on our real-time malware detection scheme
- Add Oblivious Transfer OT in our pallet to enable the usage of MPC with our GCF
- Add behavioural biometric feature

> Medium-term plan

- Bounty to crack our transaction validation protocol when both Android protected confirmation and detection of adverse code execution will be deployed

 - Continuous Liquidity Pool (like THORChain but with higher security and performance that leverages TEE/MPC/TTS + Trusted Transaction Validation protocol with multisig options (mobiles + yubikey) for validators and large liquidity owners
 
 - Seignorage mechanism by creating synthetic assets (like UST on the Terra blockchain)
 
 - Quadratic Voting/Funding features to incentivize the CLP and Seignorage functions and address potential future use cases

>The team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.


- Include a TEE layer 2 to manage a Root of trust based on full HSM hardware (with YubiHSM type of solution) to provide a 3 tier distributed HSM capability



- Investigate potential integration with Substrate Connect to increase the security and flexibility of our solution with potential additional on-chain/off-chain data/features at mobile/browser level
