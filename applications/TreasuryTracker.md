## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Problem Statement

The community is plunging into collectives without any established budgeting mechanisms. This absence of financial oversight is compounded by misunderstandings and a general lack of clarity concerning the specifics of different operations within the ecosystem. Without a clear grasp of current spending on categorized requests, it's impossible to set up appropriate budgets, resulting in a lack of control and potential misallocation of resources.

### Overview

TreasuryTracker is an innovative analytics portal designed to provide comprehensive insights into the OpenGovernance referenda on Polkadot and Kusama. Through intuitive charts, tables, and reports, the platform aims to track, analyze, and present vital data, allowing the community to understand areas of treasury funding and obtain a holistic overview of the governance process.

Our interest in creating this project comes from a shared vision of providing the community with the tools needed to actively engage in the governance process, ensure efficient utilization of treasury funds, and create a more accountable and transparent ecosystem.


### Project Details

#### Mockups/Designs of UI Components

Mockups have been created to display essential features, including interactive charts, tables, and reporting tools. The main dashboard will include an intuitive navigation menu and provide visualizations of various metrics related to the OpenGovernance referenda on Polkadot and Kusama. 

Within the following grant, we plan to implement following two analytics:

- A Weekly Cumulative Overview: Tracking New Referenda by Project Categories

- A Weekly Overview Of Approved Referenda Relative to Referenda Tracks and Requested DOT Fundings

The following examples are mockups of the future platform functionality and are NOT part of this grant. They present the prior research and the work showing the long-term vision for the platform and guide development beyond the initial phase, ensuring alignment with the defined goals after delivering a functional platform.

The summary table with all relevant data will be available to download in several formats.

#### Core Components, protocols, architecture

The governance website is built using Node.js for the backend and CakePHP for web application. Data is managed with MySQL or MariaDB, while the front-end utilizes JavaScript libraries like Chart.js and jQuery.

### Ecosystem Fit

TreasuryTracker fits within the non-core infrastructure category of the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, with a specialized focus on OpenGovernance referendums. In particular, the platform focuses on referenda that are seeking funds from the treasury offering automated data collection, analytics, and long-term oversight over treasury activities.

The target audience for our platform includes token holders interested in the long-term success and ROI of treasury-funded projects, active OpenGov participants seeking an overview of the types of projects and amount of funding allocated and the new projects requiring oversight over similar past projects, their funding, and voting success.

While there are no projects in the ecosystem that address treasury components and provide the same level of analytics as our proposed platform, there are a few with related functionalities:

- [doTreasury](https://www.dotreasury.com/dot/)  focuses solely on treasury statistics, lacking the wider analytical range that our project aims to offer
- [Grant Management Web Application RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/grant_management_webapp.md) are focused on the W3F grants UI and are not including the analytics component our platform intends to deliver.

## Development Status :open_book:

At the current stage of the project, extensive research and preparatory work have been carried out to lay the foundation for successful grant application. Below is a detailed description of the work conducted before applying for the grant:

UI Mockups and Functionality:
Prior to the proposal, careful planning and design were undertaken to create UI mockups that accurately represent the intended functionality of the platform. These mockups serve as a guide for the development process, ensuring that user experience and visual aesthetics align with the project's objectives and future plans.

On-Chain Data Reading:
Initial testing and development of functions for reading on-chain data have been performed. This represents a crucial step in achieving the project's goals, as it allows for accurate and real-time retrieval of referenda and treasury data directly from the blockchain.

Research and Community outreach:
Comprehensive research has been conducted to understand the needs of the community, the gaps in existing solutions, and the potential challenges in implementing the project.

## Future Plans

The TreasuryTracker analytics portal is set to bring a significant change to how OpenGovernance data is tracked, analyzed, and presented. However, the development of a proof of concept (POC) under this grant proposal represents only the first phase in our strategic roadmap for the platform. We have a comprehensive set of short and long-term plans intended to maximize the potential of this project:

### Short-Term Plans

After delivering a working POC, we plan to work on extensive user feedback collection and rigorous testing to further enhance and refine the platform. We aim to make necessary modifications and improvements based on this feedback to ensure the platform aligns with the needs and expectations of the community. Promotion and support will be crucial at this stage, and we intend to conduct extensive outreach to raise awareness about the project and encourage its use among our target audience.

### Long-Term Plans

As for the long-term vision, we plan to further expand the data collected and the analytical capabilities of the platform. This expansion will provide a broader range of data analytics. A particular focus will be put on enhancing the user interface and overall user experience inspired by our existing graphical mockups. The focus will be on presenting platform data in a more modern and user-friendly UI to enhance user interaction and understanding. This redesign process will prioritize clarity, ease-of-use, and intuitive navigation to best serve the platform's diverse audience.

In addition to the live analytics side, we're exploring the idea of producing periodic reports (e.g., quarterly or annually) that provide a comprehensive review of the OpenGovernance referenda on Polkadot and Kusama networks. These reports can serve as invaluable resources for the community, giving in-depth insights into trends and significant happenings in the ecosystem.

Ultimately, our goal is to make TreasuryTracker a go-to platform for all OpenGovernance data analysis and reporting needs. As the platform grows and matures, we'll continue to identify and explore new opportunities to further its reach and impact within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.
