It enables the fractional buying and selling of tax credits that historically have been inefficient, opaque, and centralized. It has already processed tax credits ranging in orders from $2K -$70k USD.</p><p>Afloat was built on a private Ethereum clone but wants to migrate to Polkadot due to its technology, identity management, and community. Parachains like Kilt and their identity services would be crucial at validating government roles and professional certifications like accountants and institutional sellers.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="background">Background<a href="#background" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Background" title="Direct link to Background">​</a></h3><p>A common tax credit is for land preservation. The inhabitants of a geographic area recognize that their shared quality of life may be positively impacted if more land was preserved rather than developed. If the owner of land property in that area agrees to preserve land, they may be eligible to receive a tax credit in an amount associated with the value of the land property. However, some owners of tax credits do not have enough tax liability to take full advantage of the reward. Because of this, a number of states allow credits to be transferred. State transferable tax credits are typically bought and sold at a discount.</p><p>Historically, the tax credit industry’s transfer process has been deeply inefficient. Due to a lack of trust between buyers and sellers, accountants and lawyers act as middlemen. This added financial and procedural cost creates an entry barrier for the majority of taxpayers into the tax credit market. What remains is a tight-knit group of wealthy buyers, sellers, and policymakers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product">Product<a href="#product" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Product" title="Direct link to Product">​</a></h3><p><a href="https://stayafloat.io/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Afloat</a> uses blockchain technology to add trust and liquidity to the market, allowing smaller fractional shares of tax credits to be transferred. So far, Afloat has facilitated the transfer of over $500,000 worth of tax credits between multiple buyers and sellers, 90% with whom Afloat anticipates an ongoing relationship. One of the platform’s sellers is an international company with over 10,000 employees, and the value of tax credits purchased per buyer has so far ranged between less than $2,000 and over $70,000.</p><p>With the ability to tap into a market sector that knows nothing about blockchain or cryptocurrency, Afloat has the potential to lay the foundation to onboard traditional companies into the Polkadot ecosystem beyond using only Afloat. We have 120 active users, many of which are CPAs (public accountants) and represent a network of taxpayers (credit buyers and sellers). We purposefully haven&#x27;t had any marketing campaigns and have been cautious with growth so far. As of April 15, 2022, we have successfully processed more than twice the total number of tax credits processed in 2021. We had a large batch of users enroll in December 2021 (end of tax year) and material increase (4x) year over year.</p><p>Having started in the US, Afloat, Inc., a Wyoming company, is compliant with existing federal, state, and local regulations and takes care of the entire transfer process with the following functions:</p><ul><li><p>Uploading proof of tax credit ownership

For example, the network will:</p><ol><li>&quot;mint or burn DOTs in order to reward the nodes that run the consensus protocol, to fund the treasury, to control the inflation rate, etc.&quot;</li><li>&quot;<!-- -->[ensure]<!-- --> DOTs also play a role in slashing protocols designed to disincentivize attacks or adversarial behaviors,&quot;</li><li>&quot;let DOT holders express their opinion in governance decisions&quot;,  and</li><li>&quot;decide which projects are allocated a parachain slot&quot;.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="migration">Migration<a href="#migration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Migration" title="Direct link to Migration">​</a></h3><p>Initially we will run on a standalone chain as a pallet. This provides the most latitude and flexibility. The initial phase is primarily focused on function, usability, and ensuring the core asset type design is secure and composable. It also includes existing user and asset migration. We will have a one-time process per user to teleport their account and assets. Most likely, we will not teleport any orders or redemptions currently in process. They would close out on the old platform, and users would create new ones after they migrate.</p><p>We did not include any scope or fund request in the proposal related to the migration work. The scope of the w3f proposal is focused on building the open source components. These will be available for the community, and Afloat will be an implementation of them. Making the pallets and tooling as general purpose as possible should help with reusability, for us and other projects.</p><p>To handle fractional tax credits in Substrate we are using &quot;fruniques&quot;. That is our name for <em>FRactional UNIQUES</em>. It&#x27;ll be compatible with the Uniques pallet and eventually with RMRK as well. It allows the user to spawn a new NFT from an existing NFT, repeatedly, while specifying an associated amount. The integrity of the total quantity must remain intact, along with metadata, but each of these NFTs can be priced, transferred, and redeemed individually.</p><p>An earlier implementation of this used a fungible token to represent the parts of the tax credit, but we&#x27;ve found that fractional NFTs fit the mental model a bit better and more ergonomically in existing tools. A user is buying a &quot;thing&quot;, see that thing in their wallet, where they may hold 7 of them. Holding various quantities of 7 different fungible tokens seemed to increase the complexity more than necessary. This is a design element we frequently brainstorm on though. In a future release, it may be useful to have fruniques support both use cases.</p><p>This proposal covers the migration or creation of the following:</p><ol><li>User onboarding (set and verify identity with gatekeeper parameters) and slides.</li><li>Sign and Login with email.</li><li>Originate and configure a tax credit and create sales orders for tax credits.</li><li>Support for encrypted files attached to tax credits.</li><li>Sell the entire or a fraction of the tax credit to interested buyers using fruniques pallets.</li><li>Ability for buyers to place buy orders.</li><li>Asset redemption workflow (tax credits require a &#x27;redemption specialist&#x27;).</li><li>Launch materials, videos and speaking arrangements.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow">Workflow<a href="#workflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow" title="Direct link to Workflow">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7217054/160020369-b64ae31d-8cc5-49ce-8c4d-82dea85546cf.png" alt="Image" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h2><p>Afloat serves tax payers that want to buy and/or sell tax credits. These users will benefit by Polkadot&#x27;s improved security and by gaining compatibility for liquidity. Polkadot will benefit from the influx of non-technical users into the ecosystem. Tax Credits trade with a heavy discount to face value, and Polkadot participants will likely want to hold them during that lifespan even if they aren&#x27;t the final redeemer. If a 5-year expiration credit is priced at $0.60-to-the-dollar by its impatient originator, it could be purchased via a more patient market maker to perhaps be sold at $0.90 in year 3 or 4, just as an example.</p><p>The secondary target audience are the community of developers that will benefit by leveraging the open source components and integrations with tax credit fruniques.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="community">Community<a href="#community" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Community" title="Direct link to Community">​</a></h3><p>As the perfect technology for record-keeping, blockchain makes a lot of sense for accountants.
