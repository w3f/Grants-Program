## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Cyclops keeps a watchful eye on your Polkadot validators, giving you a clear vision of their performance and rewards.

Cyclops aims to provide a comprehensive validator dashboard application for network validators. Cyclops will help validators to keep track of all their validators' performance and income, making it easier to manage and optimize their operations. With Cyclops, validators can access real-time data, view historical data, and receive notifications on key performance indicators, making it a vital tool for those who want to optimize their operations.

We became interested in building this project due to the popularity of our close-sourced proof of concept validator dashboard, available at [dashboard.decentradot.com](https://dashboard.decentradot.com). Currently our PoC product is monitoring over 80 validators for 50+ validator operators. We recognized the need for a similar open-sourced solution which supports parachain validators, and is developed in a future proof way.

Cyclops will provide a user-friendly interface for validators to monitor their nodes' performance, income, and network stats. The app will feature customizable alerts that notify validators of critical events, such as downtime or poor parachain performance.

#### PoC

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34348870/219812313-94c0f79c-f5b9-42c2-a724-04c6cbfaccec.png)

We currently have an operational proof-of-concept [here](https://dashboard.decentradot.com).

Initially this PoC was developed as a passion project, only meant as a closed-source tool for monitoring our own validators. After much interest from other 1kv community members, we decided to create a simple registration module and allow other network operators to use our tool. Currently our PoC has over 50 active users, monitoring 80+ validators. Even though this PoC is currently functional, it was never built with the intention to become a public service, and much of the back-end code and database structure reflects this.

The front-end is fully developed using vanilla Javascript, and the back-end runs on a node-js server utilising SocketJS for data transfer. Because of this, the current dashboard is not future proof and is hard to maintain / add additional features. Adding support for parachain validators would require a full code refactor.


#### Front-end stack

- Angular
- Typescript
- SCSS
- jQuery
- Chart.js

The combination of Angular and TypeScript will provide a powerful toolset for building the front-end of Cyclops, allowing us to easily implement API features and manage data / requests.

#### Back-end stack

- Node-JS
- Express framework
- Subscan API
- coingecko API

Cyclops will use the Express Node framework for a custom middleware solution, fetching data from the Polkadot subscan API, processing it, and providing it to the frontend application. The middleware will also handle any necessary authentication and rate limiting that may be required.

#### Features

- Login & registration system
- Support for Polkadot and parachain validators
- Elected / waiting status information
- Daily income tracking
- Token price tracking
- Network ERA progress information
- 1kv statistics
- Stash balance tracking
- Per-session ERA point performance tracking
- Monthly income reports (PDF overview of all reward transactions, handy for TAX purposes)
    Reward date
    Amount
    Monetary value at time of payout
    Extrinsic hash
- E-mail alert system
    downtime
    poor performance

### Ecosystem Fit

#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Cyclops is an important addition to the Polkadot ecosystem as it addresses a key need for network validators. Validators are a critical part of any blockchain network, and they play a key role in securing the network, validating transactions. However, managing a large number of validators can be a complex and time-consuming task, and there is a need for tools that can help validators to manage their operations more efficiently.

Cyclops fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a validator dashboard application that provides a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for validators to manage their operations. The application also provides detailed analytics and insights to help validators make informed decisions about their operations.

Cyclops complements other tools and services in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Polkadot-JS, Polkadot telemetry, and Polkadot wallet applications.

#### Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Validator operators

#### What need(s) does your project meet?
We meet several critical needs for validators in the Polkadot ecosystem, including:

Efficient Validator Management: Validator management can be a complex and time-consuming task, especially for validators who are managing a large number of validators. Cyclops provides a user-friendly dashboard that allows validators to easily monitor and manage their validators' performance and income, enabling them to optimize their operations.

Real-Time Performance Monitoring: The Polkadot network is constantly evolving, and validators need to stay on top of performance metrics to ensure that their validators are operating effectively and efficiently. Cyclops provides real-time data on key performance indicators, enabling validators to quickly identify and address any issues.

Historical Data Analysis: Historical data analysis is critical for validators who need to understand their validators' performance over time. Cyclops provides historical data and detailed analytics, allowing validators to make informed decisions about their operations.

Notifications and Alerts: Validators need to stay on top of network events and changes that can impact their validators' performance and income. Cyclops provides notifications and alerts to help validators stay informed about critical events and make informed decisions about their operations.

#### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
As far as I am aware, there are no similar projects on either Polkadot nor other blockchains. Grafana validator dashboards exist for Ethereum, though do not offer a similar level of insight and income management tools.
