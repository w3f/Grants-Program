## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- This project is going to Build a bridge between China’s clean energy market and global standards using blockchain-based hourly-matched RECs.
- The target of the project is developing a core business closed-loop of "Green Certificate Registration - Hourly Matching - Trading & Transfer - Evidence Storage - Cancellation" within the Polkadot ecosystem, Use the DOT token to pay for network fees generated by actions such as registration, trading, transfer, and cancellation.
- Develop application and deploy as a set of smart contracts on Hub during MVP Validation Period, and initially register as a parathread, Both of them need to be intergrated in Polkadot(XCM,Parathread etc)
- Key advantages of Polkadot for a carbon asset registry include: Native Interoperability and Breaking Down Data Silos. XCM protocol allows parachains to exchange messages and data seamlessly, securely, and without the need for trust.Establishing a strong, decentralized network of validators is a highly expensive and lengthy process for a new chain built specifically for carbon asset registration. Polkadot's shared security model provides 'plug-and-play' access to top-level security—this is essential for financial and environmental assets requiring utmost credibility.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Adopt simplified UI specifications, adapt to mainstream browsers like Chrome, Edge, Safari, maintain unified page style (e.g., buttons, form layouts), focus on operational process simplicity

#### Data Interface Platform
1. API Interface Management
- Provide standardized RESTful APIs: API for generation devices to report generation data, API for consumption devices to report consumption data, define JSON data format (including device ID, timestamp, electricity value).
- Fixed interface keys (assign a unique key to each device, no dynamic rotation needed), provide simplified API documentation (including request examples, error code descriptions), built-in basic interface testing function (simulate sending test data).
2. Data Validation and Cleaning
- Format Validation: Check field completeness of API reported data (e.g., presence of device ID, timestamp), correctness of data types (e.g., electricity value is numeric), return prompts for format errors.
- Logic Validation: Judge data reasonability based on device type (e.g., PV device night generation should be 0, mark as "Abnormal" if beyond reasonable range), missing data requires manual supplementation, no AI repair needed.
- Backend Development: Spring Boot (Java) - High development efficiency, mature ecosystem, facilitates quick integration with Polkadot API
Frontend Development: Vue.js + Element UI - Concise components, suitable for quickly building simplified Web interfaces
Database: MySQL 8.0 (Primary Data), Redis 7.0 - MySQL supports transactions, Redis used for caching frequently accessed data
Blockchain:	Polkadot Ecosystem(Westend, Parathread etc), @polkadot/api - Testnet is free, API library supports basic on-chain/query functions
Payment Integration: Alipay Sandbox SDK, Polkadot.js Wallet - suitable for functional verification
Deployment & Ops: Single Linux Server, Shell Monitoring Scripts - Lightweight deployment, reduces operational complexity
#### Core Business Processing System (Focus on Closed-loop Verification)
1. Green Certificate Registration Engine
- Receive cleaned power generation data pushed by the data interface platform, generate hourly green certificates according to EnergyTag Configuration 3 standards (including unique certificate number, electricity amount, type, generation time).
- Simplify the on-chain strategy to "Daily Batch On-chain" (summarize the previous day's certificate data and submit it to the Polkadot testnet daily at midnight), no distributed lock needed, certificate inventory only records basic status (Not Listed / Listed / Traded).
2. Matching Calculation Engine
- Execute matching based on the basic rule of "Hourly Time Alignment + Take the Minimum of Generation and Consumption", only process matching between traded certificates and corresponding consumption data.
- Simplify edge scenario handling: Only cover common exceptions like missing data (marked as "To Be Supplemented"), zero generation (PV at night), handle abnormal records manually.
3. Blockchain Evidence Storage Core (Polkadot Ecosystem Adaptation)
Connect to the Polkadot ecosystem, implement basic functions via the @polkadot/api library:
- Data On-chain: Calculate the SHA-256 hash of data to be stored (certificates, transactions, matching reports), submit it to the Polkadot chain and record the transaction ID.
- Evidence Query: Query on-chain evidence records (hash value, on-chain time) by business ID (e.g., certificate number, order number).
- No high concurrency adaptation needed, support less than 10 on-chain/query requests per second.
4. Business Data Middle Platform
- Aggregate data from core modules (client operation records, certificate data, matching results), establish a simplified data model, only retain key association fields (e.g., association between certificate and generation device ID).
- Simplify data consistency check to "Local Hash Comparison" (e.g., if the local hash of certificate data matches the on-chain hash, it is deemed compliant), no cross-chain data processing needed.
#### Core Functional Module Design
1. Power Generation Enterprise Client
- Enterprise Information Management: Maintain basic enterprise information (name, nature), upload core qualification documents (e.g., Electric Power Business License), support information modification and viewing.
- Metering Data Management: View hourly generation data from generation metering devices in real-time (filterable by device/date), support manual upload of historical generation data in Excel format (with data validation, e.g., format error prompts).
- Green Certificate Trading Management: Publish green certificate listing information (select time period, set unit price, minimum purchase quantity), view listing review status (Pending Review / Approved / Rejected), manage transaction orders (Confirm Transaction / Reject Transaction, track order status).
- Evidence Storage and Reporting: View hourly green certificate generation records (certificate number, electricity amount, generation time), query evidence storage vouchers on the Polkadot chain for certificates and transaction records (including hash value, on-chain time), view basic matching reports (daily/weekly cycles).
2. Electricity Consumption Enterprise Client
- Enterprise Information Management: Maintain basic enterprise information (industry type, annual electricity consumption), register electricity consumption production lines and metering devices, support information viewing and modification.
- Metering Data Management: View hourly electricity consumption data from consumption metering devices in real-time (filterable by production line/date), view enterprise-level hourly electricity consumption summary data.
- Green Certificate Trading Management: Filter listing information by certificate type, time period, price, initiate green certificate purchases (select purchase quantity, generate order), track order status (Pending Confirmation / Completed / Canceled).
- Evidence Storage and Reporting: View matching reports (including total electricity consumption, matched amount, matching rate), verify the authenticity of the report's Polkadot chain evidence storage (query hash by inputting report number).
- Our first pilot was completed in May 2025 with Wanhua, ShanDong province, and a second completed in August 2025 with Midea (both large SOEs), Guangdong province, based on EnergyTag standard to issue timestamped, verifiable certificates under Configuration 3 of the EnergyTag standard. AsiaREC enables Chinese RECs (GECs) to be layered with hourly generation and consumption data, increasing transparency, trust, and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) readiness.  

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- AsiaREC sits at the intersection of public chain infrastructure, climate data, and cross-border compliance tooling. Our pilot bridges the opaque Chinese clean energy data systems with the transparent, public infrastructure that ecosystems like Polkadot offer. The application will be building on hub and bring an Energy Tag accredited solution to the Polkadot ecosystem. This project focus on developing a core business closed-loop of "Green Certificate Registration - Hourly Matching - Trading & Transfer - Evidence Storage - Cancellation" within the Polkadot ecosystem. Use the DOT token to pay for network fees generated by actions such as registration, trading, transfer, and cancellation.
- The target users of AsiaREC are: Energy consumers (e.g., multinationals with factories in China), Power generators, Carbon market infrastructure builders, Developers building ESG/impact verification dApps, Governments and ESG auditors seeking verifiable energy data.
- AsiaREC meets the following needs for the above users:
- Power consumers: allows them to track and offset their energy consumption on an hourly basis, giving them insights to adjust operations to reduce their carbon footprint. This will also allow them to meet the reporting requirements and significantly reduce costs imposed on them by regulations like CBAM and national ETS.
- Power Generators: hourly matched GCs give them power generators incentives to supply renewable energy during the horse when the grid needs it the most, because if they are able to generate GCs during hours they are needed the most, supply & demand will cause the price to increase. Power generators are also dealing with intermittency and volatile power prices, sometimes negative. So a robust certificate market will allow them to cover costs and become economically viable without the government subsidies. 
- Carbon Market Infrastructure Builders: will be able to use our data to make critical decisions that continue to drive decarbonization of the grid. 
This also has the potential to act as a tool for governments and regulatory bodies to directly monitor the progress and compliance to their regulations. Organizations like the EU to enforce CBAM and RE100.
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
- There are no other projects doing this in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Future Plans

the APAC GC Alliance and eventually become self-sustaining through our revenue model of registry fees (ie. annual account, issuance/matching, and retirement fees). The current grants and funding schemes we are taking advantage of are the following:
Cyberport Incubation Program: https://www.cyberport.hk/en/entrepreneurship/cyberport_incubation_programme/
Green Fintech PoC Program: https://greenfintechpoc.cyberport.hk/
Web3 PoC Program: https://www.web3poc.cyberport.hk/
PolyU’s International Future Challenge: https://www.polyu.edu.hk/kteo/entrepreneurship/international-future-challenge/?sc_lang=en 
 
To give you an idea of previous pilots that we have completed, please see our write up on the Wanhau Case study ( https://energytag.org/projects/china-first-hourly-matched-pilot/ ) and the Midea Case study ( https://energytag.org/projects/china-first-hourly-matched-ppa/ ).  We plan on running multiple pilots like these cited above on the MVP that we build on Energy Web infrastructure. Each pilot will be highlighted by strategic partners globally and domestically in the China market. Eventually we will partner with large SOEs and become accredited by Energy Tag so that we have international recognition and can be promoted by industry leaders like RE100 and GHG Protocol. We also plan to do a large marketing campaign around the COP 30 conference. We believe the best way to gain market adoption is through continuing to run these pilots and educate the market on the benefit of GCs. Through these pilots AsiaREC will form a GC Alliance that is committed to growing the adoption of GC tracking across the Greater China region. These SOEs and AsiaREC users have a strong incentive to promote GCs because it will act as a tool to reduce the costs imposed on them by CBAM and other regulatory requirements. 

Our long term plan is to establish AsiaREC as a neutral GC registry for all of Asia through establishing a cross industry GC Alliance. This will act as a Polkadot-powered trust layer for clean energy markets in APAC and support China's clean energy exporters in meeting global requirements like CBAM, GHG Protocol, and RE100. We believe AsiaREC will help Hong Kong turn into a global carbon markets hub and the government will increasingly support us as we continue to make progress. Eventually we will need to trade these Granular Certificates and even set up a futures market for them, similar to the GC Trading Alliance in the US.

While we are developing the MVP and running the initial pilots on Energy Web infrastructure, we remain open to building a solution directly on the Polkadot SDK that is tailored for the Greater China region if Energy Web proves not to be the best long-term fit. Testing Energy Web allows us to run fast, low-risk pilots while also preparing our team to engage more deeply with the Polkadot ecosystem. In the longer term, we plan to launch our own tokenized market for standardized Granular Certificates (GCs), enabling efficient trading, settlement, and liquidity provisioning across Asia. This token will serve as the foundation for scaling the China REC market and integrating it with regional and global REC markets.
