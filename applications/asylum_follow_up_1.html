We can use the analogy with the Internet - there are a lot of different components, services, and content that are united into a single system due to the defined standards and protocols.</p><p>And as the Internet was started by defining the basic standards we should start building the Metaverse in the same way. That&#x27;s why the main focus for Asylum will be creating a set of open standards and protocols that will be a basement for future Metaverse. We call this set of standards IMP - Interoperable Metaverse Protocol. And such standards cannot be proprietary - we&#x27;re not trying to make it a part of our product. We are building it open and free for everyone.</p><p>And the Asylum product will consist of the etalon implementation of our standards, tools to make it usable for devs, and immersive apps for Users.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>Here we will show two parts of our work in detail - IMP and Asylum product.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="imp">IMP<a href="#imp" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to IMP" title="Direct link to IMP">​</a></h4><p><strong>What is it?</strong></p><p>IMP (Interoperable Metaverse Protocol) - is a set of open standards and protocols that will be a basement for the Metaverse - a virtual open space with a life-like experience for the user.</p><p><strong>Why is it important?</strong></p><p>A real Metaverse, that will be open and consistent can be built only with a down-top approach when firstly we are building an infrastructure and only after that start creating User-side solutions. IMP (and its implementation by Asylum) will be the fundamental layer for Metaverse, which will natively connect different spaces, games, and apps into a single space. And unlike infrastructure products that are not separate the standards and protocol to the separate entity - <strong>IMP will give an ability for every new project to implement its version of it, remaining compatible with other implementations</strong>.</p><p><strong>Who will work on it?</strong></p><p>We understand the open standard can not be built only by some particular company - that&#x27;s why we plan to gather a strong community of key players from the Metaverse market around IMP and make it owned by this community.</p><p><strong>What components will be in?</strong></p><p>IMP will consist of 6 loosely coupled blocks:</p><ol><li>Metaverse objects standard</li></ol><p>Within this standard, we are using a new approach to use NFT technology for building digital objects for Metaverse. We&#x27;ve reworked the concept of NFT as an image and concept of the NFT collections. We are seeking to make every object maximally independent from any client applications, store its history, be <strong>natively</strong> interoperable between different kinds of spaces (applications/games/etc inside the metaverse) and have fixed value to support balance between these spaces.</p><p>We wrote the main pieces of this standard within our <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/asylum.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first grant application</a>.</p><p>Here are the main materials that describe our work:</p><ul><li><a href="https://asylum.space/files/AsylumPitchDeck.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PitchDeck</a>.</li><li><a href="https://asylum.space/files/litepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Litepaper</a>.</li></ul><p>Here is also a diagram to have a quick overview of the standard:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gitlab.com/asylum-space/imp/-/raw/50a8a1bd1ba8a90b833e4cca128736d25f3e9357/standards/metaverse-object-0.1/docs/img/metaverse-objects-entities-flow-diagram.png" alt="img" class="img_ev3q"></p><ol start="2"><li>DAO protocol</li></ol><p>DAO for the Metaverse is th necessary foundation to exist - it provides ownership and participation for a User, which creates the feeling of the real life, and guarantees community-driven evolution.</p><p>As the Metaverse is a huge space that consists of many various smaller spaces and components it is not suitable to have only one big DAO to rule them all. That&#x27;s why we&#x27;re seeing this protocol and the <strong>agile framework to build multiple layers of DAO inside the Metaverse</strong>, connected to the incentivize model.</p><p>For different purposes it is suitable to use different solutions - in one place it could be critical to have fast decision making time, in another - to make sure that some proposal will be the right change for everybody. Because of this reason, we will include the different mechanisms of governance for different DAO layers.</p><p>Main layers that we see for now:</p><ul><li>DAO of the Metaverse</li><li>DAO of the space</li><li>DAO of the object</li></ul><p>The development of the last one will be included in the scope of this grant.</p><ol start="3"><li>Identity protocol</li></ol><p>For the metaverse, it is critically important to have a definition of the identity of every User. That will be the primary goal of the Identity protocol.</p><p>Besides this, it will serve to provide an interoperable NFT Avatar(s) for the User, partially by utilizing the Metaverse objects standard.</p><ol start="4"><li>Exchange protocol</li></ol><p>In our vision Metaverse spaces should be interoperable not only in a &quot;gameplay&quot; way by also economically. For example, the problem of current games and web2.0 apps is that every such app has its own closed economy and there is no possibility for, for example, usage of some in-game currency on the social platform. This block the possibility of both products growing in synergy.</p><p>We can think about Exchange protocol as the base economic laws and rules in the Metaverse. Every space can create its own, more detailed, rules as it wants, but working on the same ground it will make these economics connected.</p><p>Particularly Exchange protocol will define the base standards and workflows for exchanging currencies (FTs) and objects (NFTs). The important part of it will be incentivized model that will fairly reward ecosystem Creators and Participants (DAO participants, artists, developers, space owners, etc) for their contribution to the ecosystem.</p><ol start="5"><li>L1 - L2 sync protocol</li></ol><p>A protocol for the L2 solution is necessary here because almost every space in the Metaverse will need a fast and secure backend. Usage of the blockchain for every space need is not the best solution and that is why we need to define the L2 standard for the Metaverse.</p><ol start="6"><li>World protocol</li></ol><p>World protocol is designed to standardize the structure and rules of space inside the Metaverse. It will include space DAO, space access rights, revenue model, economy rules, versioning and control rights of client&amp;backend code, and so on.</p><p>It will be the high-level organization block and will be coupled with every block mentioned above.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asylum-product">Asylum product<a href="#asylum-product" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Asylum product" title="Direct link to Asylum product">​</a></h4><p>After we&#x27;re described the IMP structure let&#x27;s give a presentation of the Asylum product.</p><p>On the high level it can be divided into two significant parts:</p><ul><li><p>Metaverse provider</p><p>Which includes complete and ready-to-use implementation of the IMP</p></li><li><p>Metaverse ecosystem</p><p>Which includes applications, SDKs, tools, and frameworks for Creators and Players - to make the entrypoint to the Metaverse easier.</p></li></ul><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="metaverse-provider">Metaverse provider<a href="#metaverse-provider" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metaverse provider" title="Direct link to Metaverse provider">​</a></h5><p>Just like Internet has a set of standards and has providers - Asylum will develop the reference implementation of the IMP, becoming the Metaverse provider.</p><p>As the concept and functionality of IMP were described above here will be provided a short description of our implementation.</p><p>For every part of the IMP, we will implement a Substrate pallet, which will be the basement for Asylum node. For the L2 solution, we&#x27;ll use TEE technology. We plan to become firstly Kusama and then Polkadot parachain to achieve interoperability on the chain level.</p><p>For every part of the IMP we will implement a Substrate pallet, which will be the basement for Asylum node. For the L2 solution we&#x27;ll use TEE technology. Our plans are to become firstly Kusama and then Polkadot parachain to achieve interoperability on the chain level.</p><p>We&#x27;ve already partially implemented a pallet for Metaverse objects within our first grant application. Here you could find all materials and code related to it.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="metaverse-ecosystem">Metaverse ecosystem<a href="#metaverse-ecosystem" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Metaverse ecosystem" title="Direct link to Metaverse ecosystem">​</a></h5><p>To make our product accessible for the Creators and Users we will provide necessary apps and tools that will lower the barrier of entry and attract more businesses and people to become participants in this ecosystem.</p><ul><li><strong>SDK for game engines</strong></li></ul><p>As the Metaverse is about the more immersive approach to the applications - game engines are the best tools for builders of future apps. We&#x27;ve already started the development of the Unity SDK within our first grant application, here you could find all materials and code related to it. By our launch on the Kusame we also plan to deliver SDK for the Unreal engine to cover most of the market.</p><p>Working on the SDK and Creato studio we&#x27;re creating an environment where game/space developers and artists will not deal with some blockchain-specific tech but will work in their comfortable environment.</p><ul><li><strong>Creator studio app</strong></li></ul><p>Creator Studio - is the web interface for the exploring and management of the Asylum ecosystem designed for artists and developers. It was partially delivered within our first grant application, here you could find all materials and code related to it. After the last milestone delivery, it was already extended with new features and now going through the design improvement stage.</p><p>Finally it will be a single application with the different &quot;mods&quot; designed specifically for every actor: artist, developer, and space owner. It will cover functionality to set up and manage the space, work with objects, integrate them into a client, explore existing spaces and objects, etc.</p><ul><li><strong>Asylum App</strong></li></ul><p>Asylum App - the entrypoint to the Metaverse for User. As Metaverse is about immersive interfaces it will be a 3d space with life-like interactions with the system. We&#x27;re working on a design that will bring a new kind of user experience and make actions more intuitive.</p><p>This application will provide a &quot;room&quot; for every User where he can work with his inventory and avatars and dive into available spaces.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><ul><li>Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?</li></ul><p>One of our main values is interoperability, this is why Polkadot ecosystem is a good fit for us. While we&#x27;re working on intreroperability on the Metaverse layer - Polkadot is providing native interoperability on the chain level. We&#x27;re seeking to be a chain agnostic platform, because for different types of our customers there will be different chains that better fits their needs. This is why interoperability in Polkadot is so suitable solution for our platform.</p><p>From our side we will provide the first open Metaverse platform in the Polkadot ecosystem, that will be valuable for many parachains.</p><ul><li>Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp&#x27;s userbase, yourself)?</li></ul><p>Our target audience is applications, that want to become a part of united Metaverse - connect with their partners, open their economic, power up their content.</p><p>We see here three basic areas: gaming, events, education and social.
Because of games are natively attractive, have immersive approach to interactions and smooth UX - we see this field as a first and a big target for us, as it will be a starting point for the Metaverse adoption.</p><ul><li>What need(s) does your project meet?</li></ul><p>As the large-scale fundamental project we see gathering community as one of the main need now. The community with witch we will build and implement IMP so can the real world can be built.</p><ul><li>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?</li></ul><p>There are few projects in ecosystem that are working in the similar direction with Asylum:</p><ol><li><a href="https://www.rmrk.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">RMRK</a>.</li><li><a href="https://ajuna.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ajuna Network</a>.</li><li><a href="https://cyphermod.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CypherMod</a> by PhalaNetwork and RMRKAPP.</li></ol><ul><li>If so, how is your project different?</li></ul><p>Asylum is operating on the fundamental layer, working on the standards and its implementation for the whole Metaverse ecosystem. There are no such projects for now, that are working on the infrastructure solution for the whole Metaverse ecosystem (not focusing only on NFT, or other spheres) and meanwhile implementing it as an open and extendable solution, not a closed (like Sandbox).
Because of this, almost all projects operating in this market are good candidates to work together, for example including their infrastructure solutions in our ecosystem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Illia Abrosimov</strong> (Founder and СEO)</li><li><strong>Markian Ivanichok</strong> (Co-founder | СEO of Supercolony)</li><li><strong>Maria Yaremenko</strong> (Co-founder)</li><li><strong>Sven Seven</strong> (Head of Engineering | Supercolony)</li><li><strong>Horacio Lex</strong> (Rust Blockchain Developer | Supercolony)</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Illia Abrosimov</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:illia.abrosimov@asylum.space" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">illia.abrosimov@asylum.space</a></li><li><strong>Website</strong>: <a href="https://asylum.space/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Asylum</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> 68 Circular Road, #02-01, 049422, Singapore</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> Asylum Labs PTE LTD</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p><strong>Illia Abrosimov</strong> - CEO and Founder of Asylum.</p><p>Illia used to be a backend developer since 2015, started coding at Unit Factory, had experience with algorithms, graphics, and game engines.
