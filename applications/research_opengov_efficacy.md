## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in resonse to an open RFP titled [Action Research for OpenGov](https://grants.web3.foundation/docs/RFPs/action_research_opengov)

This project will deliver high quality, actionable research that fully characterizes the OpenGov governance framework on the Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate Chains. Statistical data analytics methods described below will be used to identify key performance indicators to be evaluated before and after OpenGov implementation. Participant and workflow case studies will be completed so that organizational sentiment can be analyzed. Organizational performance and culture will be evaluated. Agile governance feedback mechanisms may be suggested, as well as other opportunities identified to better align OpenGov with desired results. 

### Overview

This project will perform both qualitative and quantitative research into the governance structure known as OpenGov for the Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama blockchains. This report will compare the previous Governance V1 framework with the OpenGov framework. The basis for the assessment of OpenGov will be grounded in the stated objectives within the governance system, as well as typical sentiments associated with political decentralization. Quantitative data, as outlined below, will be collected and compared to identify any key performance indicators, correlations, trends, and insights. This will be presented in standard statistical output methods such as graphs, charts, tables, etc. Qualitative data will be collected in the form of case studies, narratives, and sentiment analysis to understand the experiential aspects, morale, and satisfaction levels of participants and stakeholders. A comprehensive final report will include recommendations for monitoring and improving the OpenGov framework, along with data collection methods and sources for reproducibility and verification.

The final technical report will be a very large research paper using the APA style of research writing delivered in the form of an open-source EPUB and PDF, under the CC BY 4.0 license. Feedback will be accepted and implemented from the Web3 Foundation at each milestone prior to any milestone payment.

The final output will follow the outline listed above. The final structure of headings and titles may vary. A technically experienced ecosystem reader should be able to read the final report and identify the sentiment behind each outline item as being completed, even if not explicitly titled as such. By reading each bullet point in the outline above with the phrase, "Does the report discuss...(outline item)" and answering in the affirmative, with content deemed satisfactory by the Web3 Foundation or their agent, that deliverable shall be considered satisfied.

Data collection tools used for this project will be included in the final report repository, along with limited instructional documentation.

- Relevant Related Work
Relevant related work will be identified and reviewed as part of the background research and case studies. This work will be documented with a reference section at the end of each chapter in the final manuscript and within each document presented for milestones.

- Intended Venue for Results Publication and Timeline
The final results will be delivered to the Web3 Foundation as an epub ebook and a PDF available for download from my GitHub repository, and as attachments to the milestone submissions. I will distribute the results as requested by the foundation.

- What the Project Is Not or Will Not Provide or Implement
The project will not research the full viability or implementation of improvement recommendations and roadmaps.
This project will provide general feedback and a continuous improvement scheme for OpenGov but will not research full feasibility or implementation methods.  
There will be recommended action items or identified dimensions that need improvement, but overall this publication is generally a fact finding mission and will be an accelerated jumping off point for stake holders to further discuss and ratify an official roadmap.  Recommendations and roadmaps presented in this project will assume the highest level of access to funds and resources.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - Continuous improvement through key performance indicator (KPI) identification and analysis of OpenGov governanace framework versus Governance V1.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - The target audience consists of Polkadot / Kusama / Substrate informed individuals ranging from community member, governance participants, to developer.  The report may have some sections that are geared to highly technical audiences. At a minimum all major deliverables outlined will be summarized in the document at a 12th grade reading comprehension level. It may be of interest to persons inside and outside of the organization, other DAO's, and educational institutions. I will be self publishing the technical report as a book once it has been peer reviewed. 

- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - Formal / scholarly data analyitics relating to OpenGov since implementation.
  - Identification of key performance indicators and analysis of trends prior to and after OpenGov implementation.
  - Participant and stakeholder narratives and experiences backed by data.
  - Continuous improvement suggestions for the OpenGov framework.
  - Initial data sets for future or continuous OpenGov analysis.

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - None known of at this time.
