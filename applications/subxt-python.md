## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- `subxt-python` is a one-to-one wrapper library of the official `subxt` library, built with [PyO3](https://github.com/PyO3/pyo3)
- Subxt is a powerful library that enables developers to interact with Substrate-based blockchains, such as Polkadot and
Kusama, by providing a user-friendly and type-safe API. By creating a Python wrapper for `subxt`, this project will
make it easier for Python developers to integrate their applications with Substrate-based networks. Python is one of
the most popular programming languages, known for its simplicity, versatility, and extensive ecosystem. Providing a
Python interface to Substrate will lower the entry barrier for Python developers, allowing them to build and deploy
applications on Polkadot and Kusama more easily. 
- The `subxt-python` wrapper will integrate seamlessly with the existing Substrate infrastructure. It will leverage the
features and functionalities provided by the subxt library, ensuring compatibility and consistency with the Substrate
framework. Python developers will be able to interact with Substrate nodes, query chain state, submit transactions, and
subscribe to events using familiar Python syntax and conventions. By exposing the full functionality of `subxt` to Python
developers, this project will contribute to the growth and adoption of the Substrate ecosystem. It will enable Python
developers to build a wide range of applications, such as wallets, explorers, tools, and dApps, on top of
Substrate-based networks like Polkadot and Kusama.
- Interest in creating this project:
  - We believe that `subxt-python` will have a significant impact on the adoption and usability of Substrate. It could
  also be used for advanced on-chain data analysis. Right now, it's challenging for the community to learn the Rust language in
  order to derive useful actionable insights from on-chain data. It's also challenging to build indexers that DApp
  developers could use for their specific applications or to build a scanner for a specific use case.

### Project Details

- API: One-to-one mapping of the existing [subxt library](https://docs.rs/subxt/latest/subxt/index.html)
- An overview of the technology stack to be used:
  - PyO3 - The framework to create Python bindings for the Rust code. Why a wrapper and not native Python implentation?
    - PyO3 is explicitly designed for creating Python extensions from Rust code, making it ideal for wrapping existing
      Rust libraries. Less maintenance on the Python side and future updates from the `subxt` library will be easier to
        integrate to keep the library up-to-date. 
    - Bindings generally have minimal overhead, meaning that the Python wrapper can closely match the speed of the
    native `subxt` library. Native Python implementation will be significantly slow. 
    - It allows maintaining the type safety guarantees offered by `subxt` Rust implementation
- Documentation of core components:
  - **Client**: main entry point for interacting with a Substrate node. Establishes a connection to the Substrate node using
  the provided configuration and allows sending requests and receiving responses.
  - **Storage**: provides a way to interact with the storage of a Substrate runtime. Allows querying storage values using
  the generated storage API. Developers can retrieve storage items, decode the stored data, and subscribe to storage
  changes.
  - **Extrinsics**: construction and submission of extrinsics to the Substrate node. Developers can sign and submit
  extrinsics, either as signed transactions or unsigned transactions.
  - **Events**: allows subscribing to runtime events and receiving notifications when specific events occur. Developers can
  define event handlers and react to events in real-time.
  - **Subscription and Streaming**: supports real-time subscriptions and streaming of data from the Substrate node.
  Developers can subscribe to storage changes, events, or other real-time updates and receive them as a stream of data.
  This would enable building reactive and event-driven applications on top of Substrate.
- What the project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement:
    - The Python wrapper complements, not replaces, the `subxt` library. Parity's `subxt` remains the primary and most
    up-to-date source for Substrate interactions.
    - Potential performance overhead compared to native `subxt`. Optimization might be a future goal but not an initial
    priority.
    - While the goal is to make the library friendly for Python developers, it might initially heavily reflect the
    structure of the Rust `subxt` library. Additional Pythonic interfaces could be developed in later stages. 


### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - Serves as a bridge between the Python developer community and the Substrate ecosystem, allowing Python developers
  to easily build and integrate applications with Substrate-based networks. `subxt-python` leverages the existing
  `subxt` Rust library and provides a Python wrapper around it using PyO3. This allows Python developers to benefit
  from the features and functionality of `subxt` while working in their preferred language.
- Who is our target audience?
  - Python developers interested in building applications that interact with Substrate-based blockchains.
  - Developers working on parachains, dApps, wallets, or UI projects who want to use Python for their development stack.
  - Researchers and data analysts who want to query and analyze data from Substrate-based networks using Python.
  - Existing Python-based projects or organizations looking to integrate with Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystems.
- What need(s) does the project meet?
  - Provides a Python interface for interacting with Substrate-based blockchains, enabling Python developers to build
  and integrate applications easily.
  - Allows Python developers to leverage the extensive Python ecosystem and libraries for data analysis, machine
  learning, and other use cases in conjunction with Substrate-based blockchains.
  - Facilitates the adoption and growth of the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem by attracting Python developers and
  expanding the developer base. Existing Substrate teams could leverage Python developers to build their projects. 
- How did we identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
  - An analysis of the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem reveals a lack of mature and actively maintained Python
  libraries for interacting with Substrate-based blockchains, indicating a gap that `subxt-python` aims to fill.
  - There's about 104 questions on [substrate stackexchange](https://substrate.stackexchange.com/search?q=python) 
    signaling the need for Python support in the Substrate ecosystem.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - Yes, there is a project called [py-substrate-interface](https://github.com/polkascan/py-substrate-interface) which
  is a Python library for interacting with Substrate-based blockchains. `subxt-python` is built on top of the subxt Rust
  library, leveraging its features, performance, and type-safe API. It provides a one-to-one mapping of `subxt`'s
  functionality to Python allowing developers to quickly iterate on their projects. `subxt-python` benefits from the
  active development and maintenance of `subxt`, ensuring compatibility with the latest Substrate versions and features.
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?
  - In the Ethereum ecosystem, there are Python libraries like [web3.py](https://web3py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and
  [eth-brownie](https://github.com/eth-brownie/brownie) that provide similar functionality for interacting with
  Ethereum-based blockchains. These libraries have gained significant adoption and have proven to be valuable tools for
  Python developers working with Ethereum.
