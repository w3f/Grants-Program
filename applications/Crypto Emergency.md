### How are we better than other projects?

 **We solve the problem of cryptocurrency awareness of the population of the planet, as a lot of people want to acquire knowledge in the field of cryptography and crypto industry.
The main resources are paid or not informative enough. Our project is absolutely free for every user and gives an opportunity to improve your crypto literacy and earn your first cryptocurrency. We also unite users on a single platform, providing convenient tools for interaction with the crypto-world as a whole. And it doesn't matter what language you speak or what country you're from. **
 

**Today there are thousands of exchanges, hundreds of thousands of tokens, and millions of platforms. Such abundance of tools misleads the average user and reduces the final impression from the use of these products to uselessness and blurred opinion, inability to use them. On our platform, the user can get information online 24/7 on all matters of interest to them. From any corner of the globe.**

**The world's first cryptocurrency social network will help unite crypto-enthusiasts in one place. **
**Wallet and NFT platform will also be available without restrictions to anyone, regardless of their country's political conditions. **
