## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Standard proposal - <https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/22>

### Overview

Our mission within this project is to make ink! usable, and achieve its wide adoption.

In order to be successful with this mission, we have outlined several steps that need to be taken.

1. OpenBrush is an open source library for secure smart-contract development on ink! as
[OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) on Solidity.

2. Openbrush should serve as a starting point for every developer entering a Polkadot(ink!) ecosystem.
3. In addition to having a standard implementation, Openbrush should also have macroses to simplify and abstract up applications(smart contracts) development.
4. In order for Openbrush to work and fulfill it's purpose, several changes must be made/several blockers overcome in `ink!` and substrate's `contract-pallet`. We are commited to do that in the context of this project.

This project is important to us as it's our strategic goal to accelerate Polkadot ecosystem development. Applications on Ink! are a huge part of it.

### Project Details

The open brush should be the starting point for smart contract developers from Ethereum.
It will contain the same folder structure as openzeppelin and documentation that describes the differences
between ink! and Solidity, how developers should change their mindset, how to design their project,
how to deploy contract and test them, etc.

The library will provide the default implementation of standard contracts, which
can be customized by developers. Also, the library will provide additional
features which are not available in ink!(and our team will try to integrate them into ink! later),
but which can be useful for development.

Our team aims to improve the smart-contract development experience,
and wants to improve ink!, make it more user-friendly and to popularize it.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The necessity of a solution like this seemed rather urgent to us when we started to work with ink!. We quikcly realized that we strategically would like to become the company that builds in the ecosystem. We decided that we want to commit and help ink! become widespread and used. Right now usability of ink! is very low. Openbrush is dedicated to change that.
  
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience are smart contract developers on ink!.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

Our project is the starting point for smart contract developers, coming from other ecosystems like Ethereum, and it aims to improve smart contract development on ink!.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  
We are only aware about one project [metis](https://github.com/patractlabs/metis). We partnered with them to collaborate on the ecosystem as we have the same commmon end goal.

* If so, how is your project different?

Our project isn't restricted to only providing the base implementation of contracts.
Objectively speaking based on what we know, and what was listed in their proposal here are key differences:
* At the moment, Openbrush is in far more advanced stage, Developer Experience of our library is significantly higher
* Openbrush aims to propose and take care of standards for ink! (We've already created [PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/22) for fungible tokens and we plan to cotinue doing so)
* Openbrush aims to be a starting point for a smart contract developer, provide documentation.
* Contribute to ink! and substrate `contract-pallet` to improve the smart-contract development experience(add new features, fix bugs, etc).

Creative Designer  
"In 2019 I started to get involved in the IT area. At first I tried myself as a developer, and eventually I went away from that, to design. At first I tried myself in design, then when I saw the result, and understood that I liked it, so I found courses and got a diploma. Then I tried freelancing, like many other beginners, but came to the conclusion that the working for a company is much better, and that is where a person can get a tremendous amount of experience, while constantly evolving, because you have to keep up with the tasks, and most importantly to understand them and try to implement them correctly. At the same time, it is my third year studying in Karazin, specialty marketing."

| 1.     | Remove boilerplate code                             | We will provide a macro which will allow to remove boilerplate during usage of library(Library provides implementation on rust level in internal trait. User must reuse internal implementation with ink! messages. Our macro will simplify it). It will simplify the code structure and usage. |
| 2.     | Derive for storages                                 | We will provide a derive macro to generate implementation for storage's structs. It will simplify integration of fields inside of struct and implementation of storage's traits for that fields. |
| 3.     | Support default implementation in external traits   | We will add mnemonic support of default implementations inside of trait definition(traits defined via `#[ink::trait_definition]`). It is mnemonic, because under the hood we will generate internal trait with default implementation that will be used in external trait.  |
| 4.     | Support of modifiers                                | We will add support of modifiers, like in Solidity. User will be able to mark some function to use modifiers and it will simplify the code. |
| 5.     | ReentrancyGuard                                     | We will add implementation of [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) |
| 6.     | Implement additional useful contract                | We will implement [PaymentSplitter](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol), [TimelockController](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol) and etc. |

| 1.     | Create Proposal for Fungible token                       | We will create a proposal for standardization of Erc20 token in case of ink! and `contract-pallet`. Based on the final decision regarding the proposal update the implementation in library.              |
| 2.     | Implement extensions for tokens                          | We will implement extensions for Erc20, Erc721 and Erc1155 tokens.              |
| 3.     | Create Proposal for Non Fungible token and Multi token   | We will create proposals for NFT and multi token, when proposal for FT token will be approved. Based on the decisions of these approves, we will update implementation in library. |

| 2.     | Add support of default implementation in trait definition on ink! level  | We will help with the support of default implementation inside of trait definition. It will require discussions with the ink! team to define the best way how to implement that without conflicts with their future changes.  |
| 3.     | Refactor of implementation according changes in ink!                     | After changes in ink! we will refactor the code of library.  |

#### Milestone 5 - Support of upgradable contracts

* **Estimated Duration:** 7 weeks(time depends on conversations in ink! and `contract-pallet` repositories)
