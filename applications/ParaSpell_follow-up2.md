## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Previously completed grants:
- [Phase 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1118)
- [Phase 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1245)

What is ParaSpell:
ParaSpell is XCM & XCMP Developer tool ment to ease integration of cross-chain functionality into dApps. As we have learnt by now, cross-chain experience between Parachains can be very diverse. ParaSpell means to unify this experience by doing all the research for developers. We have wrapped all XCM pallets from compatible nodes into simple patterns from which it is easy to create XCM call. As an example we provide image below.

In this image we can see, that ParaSpell saves much time to developers. Just one call can contain multiple lines of JSON which would otherwise have to be integrated manually by developer. ParaSpell does it in marginally less lines and hides complex logic of building message which ensures, that messages are constructed correctly. This call in the end results into following lengthy extrinsic:

Following extrinsic can be subscribed into and we can check for it's events on front end. ParaSpell provides front end for testing XCM transactions and XCM called [UI-V2](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v2). This UI is also deployed on netlify so users only have to run local network to start testing. UI also provides ability to open or close HRMP channels or test out XYK pool functionality that was implemented in collaboration with HydraDX team. In the picture below we provide overview of the UI.

### Overview üé®

ParaSpell is split into three main repositories at the moment:

- [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Meant to unify cross-chain experience on Substrate. Can serve any dApp developer that wishes to integrate XCM or other pallets support for they app.
- [UI-V2](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v2): Allows for launching local network and testing XCM or HRMP channels across that local network
- [Docs](https://github.com/paraspell/docs): Extensive documentary for overview of ParaSpell, guide for SDK and UI


#### SDK
This SDK currently support 42 compatible XCM nodes.  They can transfer XCM messages in three different scenarios. 
- Parachain to Parachain - HRMP
- Parachain to Relay chain - UMP
- Relay chain to Parachain - DMP

SDK contains many useful features that allow for easier inntegration:
-  Builder pattern implementation, easy to construct XCM calls, much more used recently for simplicity of implementation.

- Suggestions, SDK contains TYPES that help to guide developer through integration. For example he get's compatible nodes suggested.

- Console printouts, SDK allows for printing into console so developer can alway check if call they constructed is correct.
![1_2KT6Z1rxxprmE03XWYY-HA](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/219314235-1da52511-b4e8-4a41-bdaa-04fa6a9e8a48.png)

- Exporting registered assets for each compatible node in many useful functions

- Exporting supported XCM pallets for each compatible node in useful functions

And more.. 

#### UI-V2
UI is used as testing tool for Parachain developers, they can simply add their node into network and test it with HRMP channels as well as XCM transfers. UI also allows dApp developers to test and learn XCM before integrating it from our SDK.

UI is made to be as simple to use as possible. It is now also deployed on netlify so developers only have to start local network from configuration file provided by ParaSpell which starts network of Relay chain and 3 different Parachains (Bifrost,Karura & Pichiu)

Below are some examples of UI with running network:
![img4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/219366458-8873418e-9487-4762-8327-56c3294accdd.png)

Above we can see open/ close channel screen. It is simple to work with and intuitive. Nodes are pulled from relay chain by query so if network is not running you cannot see any nodes.

![img5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/219366638-38ebcdd7-5ff6-4507-8209-fc7f3ccac348.png)

Above we can observe, that UI contains simple Wallet login with test accounts.

![img6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/219366771-be566565-8bf1-477b-b7c8-3eacec6f63a0.png)

Above we can see XCM screen which is also very simple to navigate and nodes are pulled from relay chain by query.

#### Architecture üèóÔ∏è
![screenFlow](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/198412240-e031d877-c5d8-4952-9048-2e1256ba4469.svg)

UI is purposely designed to be as simple as possible. This guarantees, that all tasks can be done quickly and without extended searching. All necessary screens also feature notifications which will as a milestone explain be callback reactive. The loading screen is only present on the first application & network startup, once accessing the same screen after the application was loaded it will be skipped automatically. The screen serves to register necessary assets in parachain nodes. This is only required to be run once per network startup.

SDK currently handles transfers to 42 compatible Parachains (all XCM Palletts) ([ParaSpell SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/sdk/)) and also can transfer to both Relay chains. It is easy to construct calls as is but we want to make it even easier and more developer friendly. 

#### Technology Stack  üíªÔ∏è
-   Vue.js
-   Node.js
-   Typescript
-   Polkadot api libraries
-   Make
-   Parachain launch
-   Substrate compatible nodes (For now Rococo, Pichiu(Kylin network), Bifrost & Acala)

### Ecosystem Fit  üå≥

There are not many XCM & XCMP related development tools released currently. We aim to aid this mostly empty space and help developers to understand XCM & XCMP as the current state-of-the-art technology by providing documentation and a user interface in which they can do development tasks more easily and faster.

In Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, there are few XCM related tools in development. For example Moonbeam XCM SDK was released only recently. We bring comparison table that compares our ParaSpell SDK to Moonbeam SDK
| Features | ParaSpell XCM SDK | Moonbeam XCM SDK |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| Number of packages user has to install | User needs to install only 1 package | User needs to install 2 packages |
| Support for Parachains | Already integrated for every XCM compatible pallet Link to implementation [ParaSpell SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/sdk/)  | Every new node has to be added manually |
| Build pattern | Integrated as intuitive as possible | Integrated, not as intuitive to implement however |
| Support for asset pallet operations | Integrated  | Not integrated |
| Support for HRMP pallet operations | Integrated users can open & close HRMP channels on their local chain (Useful feature for devs) | Not integrated |
| Support for checking details that do not change | Integrated & also be covered with some error handling eg (too little ammount being sent, not sufficient for XCM transfer) | Integrated in form of small "map" for different Tokens & Node IDs |
| Support for Axelar GMP (General message passing) that will connect Substrate with EVM chains | Planned to be implemented in the future | No data |



Unlike the already mentioned "Moonbeam XCM" platform ParaSpell provides UI enhancement that uses our XCM SDK and users can try/learn technology from it. ParaSpell also includes support for 42 Substrate Parachains ([ParaSpell SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/sdk/) that have XCM pallets compared to Moonbeam XCM to which users have to implement compatible nodes manually. ParaSpell SDK only needs one package compared to Moonbeam XCM which has total of two. Compared to Moonbeam XCM which contains only XCM calls ParaSpell also contains calls that can open or close HRMP channels. We also include support for Parachains that have template pallet for XCM called polkadotXCM this pallet is a little harder to work with than xTokens, even more for inexperienced developers.

Another comparison worth mentioning is UI vs Morph which is also enhancement of XCM UI Transfer tool
| Features | ParaSpell XCM UI | Morph |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| Focus: | Developers & users that wish to try XCM locally first | Users |
| Wiki: | Comprehensive Wiki explaining XCM, how to add assets to UI & Nodes and more implemented | Not implemented |
| Support for transfers: | In three different scenarios | In two scenarios |
| Support for local network configuration: | Fully implemented example network configuration that uses maintained Parachain-launch library | Not implemented |
| Support for HRMP channel opening/closing: | Fully implemented | Not implemented |

Unlike the already mentioned "Morph" platform ParaSpell focuses more on developers. ParaSpell features complete network install and startup configuration in one single command. This automatization ensures, that developers do not need to do any extra tasks when they wish to run development nodes locally. ParaSpell also allows developers to open and close HRMP channels between Parachains they connected. Like "Morph", ParaSpell can also transfer fungible tokens in three scenarios. From Parachains to Relay chain, from Relay chain to Parachains & from Parachains to Parachains.

We are currently in talks with several Parachain teams that like the idea of unified SDK for XCM transfers as much as we do. SDK that unifies XCM can be very helpful for entire ecosystem in our opinion.

Our target audiences are Web3 projects and starting/current blockchain developers.

## Future Plans üî≠

Once everything will be implemented according to the proposed plan application will still be under constant improvement as technology will progress. For example, once the XCMP protocol will be released we wish to deprecate the HRMP protocol we currently use for channels.

In a long run, we also want to improve design of the UI, add new features that can be useful for developers and support for new nodes.

Project goal is that SDK will serve dApp developers and UI will teach new substrate developers to use XCM and will serve to existing substrate developers to test their freshly baked Parachains.
