### Ecosystem Fit

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

> We are aiming to offer the first decentralized KYC/ICO  in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

> To start with, our target audience are the DICO/DOT/KSM/other tokens holders who are looking to participate in ICO project. and the team funded through ICO.at this stage, we will provide a KYC area for legal regional ICO. next， we provide derivatives related to ICO. Such as providing token exchange and staking protocol. at this stage, allow any token holders to participate in their promising projects. in addition,We will go to support or self-improve all the required ecology, such as social. finally, we provide stable project maintenance and update functions that keep pace with the times, and serve the entire ecological stability.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

> Be a platform to link ideas and capital.


* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  * If so, how is your project different? *coinlist*，A token financing platform, all the mainstream virtual currencies above can be traded and financed. It provides token financing, but does not provide the funds needed by early creator and the control of the entire project cycle.

  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems? We have not yet found a project that will be focusing ICO and derivatives.
