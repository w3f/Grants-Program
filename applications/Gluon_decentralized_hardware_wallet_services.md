### Overview

Leaking or losing private keys are the primary concern for most blockchain users. Gluon uses a new approach to prevent such a disaster. 

Gluon is a Taas (Trust-as-a-Service) application that provides hardware crypto wallet services to crypto users. Our design goal is to create an all-in-one private key manager for MultiSig-enabled blockchains. 

Features:
- Passwordless to users. Users won't take responsibility for backup mnemonic phrases.
- Social disaster recovery when users lose all authentication devices.
- Private keys managed by Gluon over TEA network are randomly distributed and encrypted by TEA Nodes, which are are hardware secure modules(HSM). No single point of failure.
- Tolerance of up to 1/3 compromised or failure nodes.
- Users only need to submit a transaction to Gluon. Gluon takes over the rest to sign and commit blockchain.
- Leverages popular biometric technologies in mobile devices to get better user experiences without compromising security.

Gluon itself is built into a WebAssembly module that is loaded and runs inside the T-rust framework. They are both TEA projects. Gluon is an application (We call TeaLeaf); T-rust is a framework (We call TeaTree). T-rust contains layer1 and layer2; Layer1 is a blockchain that is powered by Substrate while Layer2 is a particularly designed mini OS along with many WebAssembly modules that run on wasm runtime powered by [WaSCC](wascc.dev). 


Gluon serves all Polkadot ecosystem dApps and other blockchains as an entry point (portal). Gluon is transparent to other client chains so there is no integration needed. 

We designed and developed Gluon in order to:
- Lower the barrier to dApps' end users; improve user experiences.
- Protect users' crypto assets.
- Demonstrate the potential of Substrate and TEA project.

>  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details 

#### Unique features of Gluon

From a users point of view, Gluon works just like a hardware wallet, but with a few differences:
- Traditional hardware wallet is just one single hardware secure module (HSM), but Gluon is a group of thousands of HSM running consensus together to protect clients' assets. (Every TEA Mining Node is an HSM which can be considered as a hardware wallet)
Regardless of if it is BTC, ETH, or DOT, users will not get the private key or mnemonic phrases until after the address is created. 
- Users need both a Polkadot extension and a Gluon mobile app to access their Gluon account.
- Users can transfer authentication factors (such as a mobile phone upgrade)
- If users lose both their computer (web auth) and phone, social recovery can still protect and recover their crypto assets to their new accounts. 
- Users only need to submit a transaction; Gluon will submit the signature to the client blockchain directly. Users don't need to submit the signed transaction to the blockchain manually. 

#### How private keys are protected by Gluon

By default, Gluon generates 2/3 MultiSig addresses for users. The three private keys (secret) are called P1, P2, and P3. P1 is stored in the users' mobile phone, while P2 and P3 are controlled by Gluon consensuses. They are immediately split into pieces using [Shamir Secure Sharing Schema](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) right after generation. The split pieces are distributed to replicas of many TEA Nodes. TEA nodes are HSM (Hardware Secure Module). One can consider commonly used hardware wallets as special-purpose HSM, but TEA nodes are a general-purpose HSM that can do much more. The secret will never be exposed outside of hardware-protected TEA node's RAM, nor saved to any storage medias persistently. When the secret is used to sign a transaction from authorized users, it will be reconstructed and signs transactions inside a VRF selected TEA node under both hardware protection and remote attestations from a consensus called Proof of Trust (PoT). Due to the randomness, no one knows which TEA node stores which Shamir pieces of which secret. No one can predict which TEA node will be selected or is working on generating or rebuilding the secret. The randomness can be verified by other TEA nodes or substrate-runtime logic at both runtime and future audits. 

P2 and P3 are all controlled by Layer1 (a Substrate blockchain) runtime logic. Among them, P2 is associate with the users' 2FA. We are using the Polkadot web extension at the moment. P3 is associated with a users' social recovery accounts. P3 is only used to recover user assets when users lose P1. (Users can only store P1 on their phones, so P1 is the only key that could be lost). This means users can assign friends as "social recovery accounts." If K of N accounts sign the "recovery transaction," P3 will be used along with P2 to transfer user assets to their new account.

P1 is stored in the users' Gluon mobile app. P1 will never be exposed beyond the phone even when upgrading devices. However, Gluon doesn't require users to take responsibility to backup mnemonic phrases. When upgrading to a new phone, the Gluon app can transfer P1 securely to the new device without exposing it to the network. If users lose their phones, there is no way to restore P1 because there are no backup mnemonic phrases. Losing or the leak of P1 does not lead to the loss of assets, as one can use P2+P3 for recovery and bad actors would need two keys to access assets in the case of a leak. As mentioned above, Gluon can transfer all assets to ones' new account by running a social recovery process.

#### User experiences

From the end user's point of view, Gluon is a mobile app and a web extension. The end-user needs to install the Polkadot web extension on their browser to visit any dApp sites to generate transactions to be signed. They also will need to install a Gluon mobile app as a decentralized 2FA (not the traditional centralized 2FA). 

Users can go to the Gluonwallet.com website or any other compatible dApp to create a transaction. The web extension will generate a transaction like a QR code on the web page. Users will use the Gluon mobile app to scan this QR code, verify the transaction details, then fingerprint-unlock the partial signing on the phone. Once the phone sends the partial signature to the Gluon network, TEA nodes will reconstruct P2 using the Shamir algorithm to complete the 2nd partial signature. Once two partial signatures are complete, they are committed to the client blockchain in order to continue processing the transaction. 

#### Relationship between Gluon and T-rust

From the miners' point of view, Gluon is a dApp that runs on top of the T-rust framework. When compiling the source code, a WebAssembly file "gluon.wasm" is generated. This wasm file is loaded to the miner's TEA node by adding Gluon.wasm file hash to their TEA nodes' manifest file. Miners can load this wasm module from IPFS directly. Once "gluon.wasm" is loaded into TEA runtime, this TEA node becomes a TEA hardware wallet capability provider. 

Gluon.wasm only handles crypto wallet related logic. All other consensuses, security, network, and hardware validation happens in the T-rust framework.

#### Gluon and T-rust's root of trust and PoT (Proof of Trust) consensus
T-rust is a layer2 trusted computing solution on top of a Substrate-based blockchain (layer1). Unlike most blockchain, whose root-of-trust comes from cryptography and consensus, T-rust introduces hardware root-of-trust as the third dimension. Unlike most other blockchains that make consensus on the result, T-rust makes consensus on the proof of trust that comes from hardware TPM chips. Using hardware RoT makes the consensus much efficient than many blockchains. T-rust can run complex or privacy-sensitive computations, which are not likely possible in other blockchains. Distributed storage of private keys needs both privacy and complex computing, so Gluon is an ideal dApp running on top of T-rust. Gluon and T-rust are two TEA Projects.

![root of trust](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1120/1*5cLoCE4mLRw7hhDjcuaAxA.png)

#### How other blockchains or dApps integrate with Gluon

For other blockchains, there is nothing that needs to be done when integrating with Gluon; Gluon is transparent to other client blockchains. Gluon is virtually a client who commits the signed transaction and listens to block events. Gluon needs to run a few light clients as gateways to these client blockchains.

For other dApps, integrating with Gluon is as sample as adding one js API. This js API does three things:
- Gathering input transaction details and show in a QR code.
- Sending the hash of transaction and client_id in a TEA transaction to the TEA blockchain. 
- Listen to the events from the TEA blockchain. 

#### UI mockups

![typical workflow](https://github.com/tearust/gluon-docs/blob/master/res/typical-workflow.png?raw=true)

The diagram above shows a typical UI workflow, which is signing a BTC transaction. 

Users start a task from the web browser. It could be the Gluon web portal or any dApps' website embedded with our js API. A hash of the transaction detail is sent to Gluon TeaLeaf. A QR code is shown on the web page for the paired Gluon mobile app to scan. 

After scanning the QR code, the Gluon mobile app shows the transaction's detail for users to confirm visually. Users approve this transaction by fingerprinting. If there is an additional 2FA (MFA) applied, enter the passcode now. 

Gluon mobile app partially signs the transaction using P1. Both signature and transaction details are sent to Gluon TeaLeaf to continue.

Gluon TeaLeaf takes over the rest of the task by reconstructing P2 and sign. Finally, Gluon TeaLeaf sends the signature by P1 and P2 to Bitcoin light node to complete the transaction. 

Both web UI and mobile app received the event of a completed task.

All other tasks are pretty much the same workflow.

#### Technology stack to be used

T-rust is a bit more complicated.

##### TEA's four pillars

![four pillars](https://github.com/tearust/tea-docs/raw/main/res/s8.jpg)
In general, TEA is based off of four technologies: 
- Substrate: This is layer 1 of T-rust. It runs PoT consensus and the immutable storage of hashes from hardware chips. Blockchain is the source that the software root of trust comes from.
- IPFS: This is the file system and network layer of T-rust. All public code and data are stored in IPFS but all secrets are kept inside TEA modules (the HSM).
- Trusted Computing: This is where the hardware root of trust comes from. We use the TPM chips inside the TEA module (HSM) as evidence of PoT.
- WebAssembly: All running executable code is in wasm format and runs inside of secure wasm runtime except for our OS, runtime, and system providers. 

90% of the source code is written in Rust. The other 6% is written in JS, and the remaining 4% in Golang. 

For more detail on the TEA project and T-rust framework, please go to teaproject.org.

#### Prior works and demo

Gluon is a dApp and a wasm module running on top of T-rust. We currently do not have the Gluon demo running (but it will be available soon). We do have another demo app showing the capability of the T-rust framework.
This demo is a Tensorflow image recognization running on Substrate blockchain.

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

There are many existing crypto wallets in the market. They either store the private keys on client devices (phone, hardware wallet) or centralized servers. There are quite a few wallets in Web3 applications. For example: [bdwallet](https://github.com/tearust/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/bdwallet.md), or [subwallet](https://github.com/tearust/Open-Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/subwallet.md)

Gluon has a very decentralized approach. We do not store the original keys anywhere. Instead, we use the TEA project's decentralized trusted computing infrastructure to scramble, store, reconstruct private keys. This approach prevents users from losing or leaking their keys. 

A few crypto wallets outside of the Polkadot ecosystem are a little bit similar to ours.

[ZenGo](https://zengo.com/security/) provides "passwordless" but still require centralized servers to store encrypted secrets. We do everything decentralized.

[Recovery pellets](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/recovery) is not a wallet but a Substrate pellet with the social recovery idea. We did not know it until we search for a similar project just now. 

[Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/) or [Trezor](https://trezor.io/) are hardware wallets. We do not sell hardware wallet units to end-users. We provide trust-as-a-service instead.

### Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience.  If the project involves development work, we'd appreciated if you can single out a few interesting code commits made by team members on their past projects. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful.  

The TEA-Project started in the year 2019. The idea originally came to the team leader, Kevin Zhang, seven years ago when he was working as the CTO of iHealthLabs. Utilizing patients' health data for scientific research while preventing health data breaches has always been a prominent problem. He initially tried to solve the dilemma using blockchain, but realized that the existing blockchain technologies were far too slow to be practical. He then decided add an additional root of trust alongside existing blockchain cryptography + consensus. This is the hardware root of trust. TEA uses existing mature Trusted Computing technologies to provide secure computing services to client blockchains, without requiring specialised CPU features such as Phala's (TEE) Intel SGX CPU or Bitcoin's ASIC CPU. Besides the existing Tensorflow demo app on TEA, making a practical crypto wallet can demonstrate how TEA can do better. So they started the Gluon.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as a number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
* Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research-oriented and as such there is no code to test)

## Future Plans

 Gluon is a full-featured demo application for the TEA project once it is ready. So far, there are a few limitations that we are working on.

 - TEA modules are running on a software simulator at the moment. In the final product, it will only run on HSM so that it can be protected by hardware. The simulators are only allowed to be running in the test chain, not in the production chain.
 - Besides BTC, we will support ETH and all Polkadot ecosystem chains.
 - Gluon layer1 is now sharing the T-rust main chain. We will move Gluon's pallet to a sidechain run parallel to T-rust's chain. T-rust's chain runs parallel with Polkadot's main chain. 
 - Retire our facade interface service. Use off-chain workers instead.
 - Shamir Secret Sharing Schema has [Shortcomings](https://blog.keys.casa/shamirs-secret-sharing-security-shortcomings/). We have used randomness and hardware protection to minimized the impact. However we never stop exploration. We have done some research on existing SMPC and FHE algorithms such as BLS Signature Schema. But none of them are practical at the moment. We are looking forward to new higher performance algorithms to fundamentally remove the needs to reconstruct secret for signing.

Most items in this to-do list are part of the TEA Project plan. When TEA is ready, most of the features are completed too.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

We started the TEA project in 2019. It has been under the radar until recently, when it was released to the public. We believe the TEA project could grow large and become the backend service platform for new type of dApps. These dApps can go beyond the limit of traditional blockchain technologies. Gluon is just one of the many possible demo apps. Once our honor gets granted, we will start looking for investors and hire a CEO along with more developers to join us. We hope to maintain a long term and close relationship with the Polkadot community.
