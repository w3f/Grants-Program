## Project Overview

The Capella Project is a community blockchain tailored to the Philippine society, designed to strengthen citizen empowerment and enhance transparency in government records. Inspired by Capella, one of the brightest and most reliable stars in the cosmos, the project embodies clarity, stability, and illumination, serving as a guiding beacon for digital trust and ensuring government data remains accessible, tamper-proof, and transparent for every Filipino.

### Overview

The Capella Project was conceived when the developers of the Xode Blockchain were invited by the Senate of the Philippines to explore how blockchain technology could directly address long-standing issues of corruption, lack of transparency, and limited citizen participation in governance. Responding to this call, the team proposed Capella, a community-driven blockchain designed to empower citizens by giving them transparent, tamper-proof access to public records and government processes.

As the initial implementation aligned with the Senate’s forthcoming legislative framework, Capella serves as a real-world demonstration of how decentralized systems can strengthen public accountability. By enabling immutable audit trails, real-time data visibility, and verifiable actions from government offices, Capella provides a technological foundation for restoring trust in public institutions.

The project also represents a strategic milestone for the Philippines’ digital future. Through Capella, Substrate and Polkadot technologies are positioned to become the de facto standard for the country’s blockchain infrastructure, offering modularity, scalability, security, and interoperability for nationwide systems. Beyond transparency, Capella lays the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of public-sector innovation, where citizens, developers, and government agencies collaborate on a unified, next-generation digital governance platform.

### Project Details

#### Problem Statement

Lack of transparency in government budgeting and spending makes it difficult for citizens, civil society, and even oversight bodies to track how public funds are allocated and used. This opacity has contributed to corruption, the proliferation of ghost projects, and the misuse of public resources, as seen in cases where infrastructure funds listed in the Department of Public Works and Highways’ budget either did not materialize or were mismanaged, with little visibility into procurement processes, disbursements, and project execution. Additionally, the current system provides minimal opportunity for meaningful citizen participation or accountability, leaving taxpayers unable to effectively question or monitor government expenditures. Inefficiencies in record-keeping and weak audit-traceability further compound these issues, as financial data can be fragmented, delayed, or prone to manipulation, undermining public trust in institutions and the effective management of national resources.

#### Senate Bill No. 1330

Senate Bill No. 1330 seeks to address the problem of opaque government budgeting and spending by leveraging blockchain technology to make financial data transparent, immutable, and publicly accessible. By recording every step of the budget process, from appropriation, fund release, and procurement, to project execution and liquidation on a blockchain ledger, all transactions become time-stamped and tamper-proof, creating a permanent audit trail. This allows citizens, civil society groups, and oversight bodies to independently verify how funds are allocated and spent in real time, reducing opportunities for corruption, ghost projects, and fund mismanagement. 

Blockchain’s decentralized and secure nature also ensures that records cannot be altered retroactively, strengthening accountability and trust in government operations. Furthermore, by making budget data accessible through user-friendly interfaces, SB 1330 empowers citizens to monitor expenditures, participate in oversight, and hold public officials accountable, while streamlining auditing processes and improving overall efficiency in public finance management.

#### Blockchain Infrastructure

The base-layer of the project is built on Substrate parachain technology within the Polkadot ecosystem, providing a modern, scalable, and interoperable blockchain foundation. Leveraging Substrate allows for modular development, enabling the customization of consensus mechanisms, governance models, and runtime logic to meet the specific needs of government agencies and LGUs. As a parachain, the network benefits from Polkadot’s shared security model, ensuring that all data submitted on-chain is protected by robust validator networks without each agency needing to maintain its own separate security infrastructure. This provides a high level of trust and resilience while keeping operational complexity manageable.

A key feature of this system is the ability for agencies, local government units (LGUs), and departments to submit data to the blockchain without needing to migrate or alter their existing internal systems. This ensures that original records remain securely within their own servers, maintaining operational continuity and compliance with existing regulations regarding data privacy and storage. By recording only cryptographic proofs, hashes, or references on-chain, agencies can ensure that the blockchain reflects an immutable snapshot of their data, while the full data sets remain under their control. This approach also minimizes the risks associated with data duplication or accidental exposure.

Moreover, this architecture enables transparency and accountability without compromising operational autonomy. When agencies send data to the blockchain, the system records a verifiable proof that can be publicly audited or inspected by authorized entities, including civil society, oversight bodies, and other government departments. This mechanism allows for efficient tracking of transactions, budget allocations, and project execution while preserving the integrity of the original records. Over time, this model fosters trust among citizens and stakeholders, as the blockchain provides undeniable evidence that government processes are conducted according to official records.

Finally, by focusing on the base-layer first, the project lays the groundwork for future layers of governance, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Once agencies are able to securely send data on-chain while maintaining their internal systems, additional features—such as automated workflows, inter-agency data sharing, and citizen-facing dashboards—can be introduced. This phased approach ensures that the blockchain becomes a practical and scalable tool for public accountability while allowing each government unit to adapt at its own pace.
