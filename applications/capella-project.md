## Project Overview

The Capella Project is a community blockchain tailored to the Philippine society, designed to strengthen citizen empowerment and enhance transparency in government records. Inspired by Capella, one of the brightest and most reliable stars in the cosmos, the project embodies clarity, stability, and illumination, serving as a guiding beacon for digital trust and ensuring government data remains accessible, tamper-proof, and transparent for every Filipino.

### Overview

The Capella Project was conceived when the developers of the Xode Blockchain were invited by the Senate of the Philippines to explore how blockchain technology could directly address long-standing issues of corruption, lack of transparency, and limited citizen participation in governance. Responding to this call, the team proposed Capella, a community-driven blockchain designed to empower citizens by giving them transparent, tamper-proof access to public records and government processes.

As the initial implementation aligned with the Senate’s forthcoming legislative framework, Capella serves as a real-world demonstration of how decentralized systems can strengthen public accountability. By enabling immutable audit trails, real-time data visibility, and verifiable actions from government offices, Capella provides a technological foundation for restoring trust in public institutions.

The project also represents a strategic milestone for the Philippines’ digital future. Through Capella, Substrate and Polkadot technologies are positioned to become the de facto standard for the country’s blockchain infrastructure, offering modularity, scalability, security, and interoperability for nationwide systems. Beyond transparency, Capella lays the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of public-sector innovation, where citizens, developers, and government agencies collaborate on a unified, next-generation digital governance platform.

### Project Details

#### Problem Statement

Lack of transparency in government budgeting and spending makes it difficult for citizens, civil society, and even oversight bodies to track how public funds are allocated and used. This opacity has contributed to corruption, the proliferation of ghost projects, and the misuse of public resources, as seen in cases where infrastructure funds listed in the Department of Public Works and Highways’ budget either did not materialize or were mismanaged, with little visibility into procurement processes, disbursements, and project execution. Additionally, the current system provides minimal opportunity for meaningful citizen participation or accountability, leaving taxpayers unable to effectively question or monitor government expenditures. Inefficiencies in record-keeping and weak audit-traceability further compound these issues, as financial data can be fragmented, delayed, or prone to manipulation, undermining public trust in institutions and the effective management of national resources.

#### Senate Bill No. 1330

Senate Bill Number (SBN) 1330, known as "Blockchain the Budget Bill", was authored by Senator Bam Aquino.  It seeks to address the problem of opaque government budgeting and spending by leveraging blockchain technology to make financial data transparent, immutable, and publicly accessible. By recording every step of the budget process, from appropriation, fund release, and procurement, to project execution and liquidation on a blockchain ledger, all transactions become time-stamped and tamper-proof, creating a permanent audit trail. This allows citizens, civil society groups, and oversight bodies to independently verify how funds are allocated and spent in real time, reducing opportunities for corruption, ghost projects, and fund mismanagement. 

Blockchain's decentralized and secure nature also ensures that records cannot be altered retroactively, strengthening accountability and trust in government operations. Furthermore, by making budget data accessible through user-friendly interfaces, SB 1330 empowers citizens to monitor expenditures, participate in oversight, and hold public officials accountable, while streamlining auditing processes and improving overall efficiency in public finance management.

#### Senate Bill No. 1506

On November 12, 2025, Senate Bill No. 1330 evolved into and was replaced by [Senate Bill No. 1506](https://senate.gov.ph/legislative-documents/bills/610729?documentType=Bill&congress=20th+Congress), or "The CADENA Act."  It stands for Citizen Access and Disclosure of Expenditures for National Accountability (CADENA) Act. This evolution was a product of consultations with various stakeholders, including the Technical Working Group (TWG) organized by the Senate Committee on Science and Technology, headed by Senator Bam Aquino. 

Sec. 2. Declaration of Policy. – It is the policy of the State to uphold transparency, accountability, and good governance in the management and disbursement of public funds. The State shall safeguard honesty and integrity in public service, adopt effective measures against graft and corruption, and institutionalize public disclosure through open, verifiable, and citizen-accessible digital systems. To this end, the government shall establish a digital platform that provides timely, accurate, tamper-evident, and traceable publication of government budget transactions. The system shall guarantee that all government appropriations, disbursements, procurements, and expenditures are disclosed and made publicly accessible to citizens and oversight institutions.

Sec. 4. Coverage. – This Act shall apply to all National Government departments, bureaus, offices, agencies, and other instrumentalities, including government-owned or controlled corporations, and their subsidiaries.

#### Blockchain Infrastructure

The base layer of the project is built on Substrate parachain technology within the Polkadot ecosystem, providing a modern, scalable, and interoperable blockchain foundation. Leveraging Substrate allows for modular development, enabling the customization of consensus mechanisms, governance models, and runtime logic to meet the specific needs of government agencies and LGUs. As a parachain, the network benefits from Polkadot’s shared security model, ensuring that all data submitted on-chain is protected by robust validator networks without each agency needing to maintain its own separate security infrastructure. This provides a high level of trust and resilience while keeping operational complexity manageable.

A key feature of this system is the ability for agencies, [local government units (LGUs)](https://bettergov.ph/government/local), and [departments](https://bettergov.ph/government/departments) to submit data to the blockchain without needing to migrate or alter their existing internal systems. This ensures that original records remain securely within their own servers, maintaining operational continuity and compliance with existing regulations regarding data privacy and storage. By recording only cryptographic proofs, hashes, or references on-chain, agencies can ensure that the blockchain reflects an immutable snapshot of their data, while the full data sets remain under their control. This approach also minimizes the risks associated with data duplication or accidental exposure.

Moreover, this architecture enables transparency and accountability without compromising operational autonomy. When agencies send data to the blockchain, the system records a verifiable proof that can be publicly audited or inspected by authorized entities, including civil society, oversight bodies, and other government departments. This mechanism allows for efficient tracking of transactions, budget allocations, and project execution while preserving the integrity of the original records. Over time, this model fosters trust among citizens and stakeholders, as the blockchain provides undeniable evidence that government processes are conducted according to official records.

Finally, by focusing on the base-layer first, the project lays the groundwork for future layers of governance, smart contracts, and decentralized applications. Once agencies are able to securely send data on-chain while maintaining their internal systems, additional features such as automated workflows, inter-agency data sharing, and citizen-facing dashboards—can be introduced. This phased approach ensures that the blockchain becomes a practical and scalable tool for public accountability while allowing each government unit to adapt at its own pace.

#### Citizen Empowerment

Capella is designed not only as a transparency tool for government operations but also as a powerful platform for citizen empowerment. By ensuring that public sector data resides on a permissionless, decentralized, and tamper-proof infrastructure, Capella transforms how citizens, developers, researchers, and civil society interact with government information. Instead of data being locked away in agency silos or hidden behind opaque bureaucratic systems, Capella makes critical information openly accessible, verifiable, and ready for innovation.

Once government data is continuously streamed onto the Capella chain, whether it involves budgets, procurement, disbursements, project milestones, or delivery outcomes—it becomes a public resource that any citizen can analyze. This shift fundamentally changes the balance of power. Transparency is no longer dependent on voluntary disclosures or delayed FOI requests. Instead, it becomes an inherent property of the nation’s digital public infrastructure. Citizens can verify government actions in real time, and wrongdoing becomes significantly harder to conceal.

This open-data environment creates fertile ground for student communities, watchdog organizations, journalists, and grassroots civic groups. University students studying computer science, politics, public administration, or economics can now work with authentic, live government datasets for their research and capstone projects. Developers and tech communities gain the opportunity to build applications, dashboards, and analytics tools that can detect anomalies, highlight suspicious spending patterns, or track project delays across regions. Anti-corruption organizations and investigative journalists can automate much of their auditing processes, freeing up time for deeper investigations.

One of the most transformative outcomes of Capella is the ecosystem of innovation it unlocks. With permissionless access and guaranteed data reliability, groups across the country can organize hackathons, bootcamps, and civic-tech challenges centered on public-sector transparency. Participants can leverage modern technologies like AI, machine learning, data science, real-time analytics, and visualization platforms, to create intelligent tools that were previously impossible under traditional closed systems. For example, AI models can be trained to flag red flags in procurement, detect patterns of ghost projects, or predict potential corruption hotspots based on historical behavior.

Capella therefore becomes more than a blockchain, it becomes the foundation for a new generation of civic engagement. It empowers citizens not just to observe governance, but to actively participate in improving it. Through open innovation, community-driven oversight, and data-driven accountability, Capella cultivates a culture where transparency is the norm and corruption is systematically discouraged. Ultimately, Capella enables a future where civil society plays a central role in building a more honest, efficient, and collaborative government for all Filipinos.

### Ecosystem Fit

Capella plays a strategic and high-impact role within the broader Polkadot ecosystem by serving as the first large-scale, government-aligned, citizen-focused blockchain initiative in the Philippines. As a Substrate-based chain aligned with Polkadot’s architecture, Capella brings real-world national use-cases, continuous on-chain government data streams, and mass citizen participation—elements that directly reinforce Polkadot’s mission of building the world’s most secure and interoperable multi-chain network. By moving public-sector transparency and anti-corruption initiatives to a decentralized, permissionless chain, Capella showcases the capabilities of Polkadot technology in solving complex governance problems that traditional databases cannot handle.

By positioning itself as a Community Blockchain for citizen empowerment, Capella also brings new types of users into the Polkadot ecosystem. These include universities, watchdog organizations, student developers, civil society groups, and local government offices. Many of these sectors have not traditionally engaged with blockchain networks, but Capella’s socially impactful mission attracts them to Polkadot technology for the first time. As these groups participate in hackathons, build transparency apps, create dashboards, and develop AI-driven governance tools, Polkadot gains a new wave of builders and contributors who anchor their innovations to Substrate and XCM-based infrastructure.

From a reputation standpoint, Capella provides Polkadot with a flagship public-good use-case at a national level, something few ecosystems can claim. When a government-backed initiative chooses Substrate and Polkadot as its backbone for openness, transparency, and accountability, it signals strong technological credibility. This enhances Polkadot’s standing in global discussions around digital governance, decentralized public infrastructure, and blockchain adoption in the public sector. Capella becomes a reference model that other countries, agencies, and municipalities can study and replicate, positioning Polkadot as the de-facto standard for government-grade blockchain solutions.

Finally, Capella’s long-term roadmap, encompassing public-sector data interoperability, decentralized monitoring, citizen interfaces, and future national blockchain adoption, creates a sustainable pipeline of innovation for Polkadot. It encourages more chains to build complementary solutions, including identity verification, AI-driven analytics, decentralized archiving, and compliance tooling. As these new components flourish, Polkadot grows not just in technical capabilities but in real-world legitimacy, with Capella serving as a cornerstone example of blockchain used for societal benefit.

In essence, Capella amplifies Polkadot by bringing real-world institutional adoption, a diverse user base, continuous valuable data, and a strong governance-driven narrative,cementing Polkadot as the premier platform for decentralized public infrastructure.

### Future Plans

#### CBDC and Stable Coins in Capella for Remittance application
With Capella fully deployed and actively used by citizens, the platform becomes a strong foundation for expanding into major national-scale use cases. One of the most strategic opportunities is the introduction of CBDC-backed digital assets, enabling financial institutions to leverage Capella as a secure, transparent settlement layer. This also opens the door for on-chain remittances from overseas Filipino workers, where a central-bank-issued stablecoin can move through Capella with lower costs, faster settlement, and full auditability. These advancements become possible precisely because Capella is a community-based, fully permissionless blockchain, allowing both public and private sectors, including banks, fintechs, and regulators to build seamlessly on top of a shared national infrastructure.
