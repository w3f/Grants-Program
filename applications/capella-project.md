## Project Overview

The Capella Project is a community blockchain tailored to the Philippine society, designed to strengthen citizen empowerment and enhance transparency in government records. Inspired by Capella, one of the brightest and most reliable stars in the cosmos, the project embodies clarity, stability, and illumination, serving as a guiding beacon for digital trust and ensuring government data remains accessible, tamper-proof, and transparent for every Filipino.

### Overview

The Capella Project was conceived when the developers of the Xode Blockchain were invited by the Senate of the Philippines to explore how blockchain technology could directly address long-standing issues of corruption, lack of transparency, and limited citizen participation in governance. Responding to this call, the team proposed Capella, a community-driven blockchain designed to empower citizens by giving them transparent, tamper-proof access to public records and government processes.

As the initial implementation aligned with the Senate’s forthcoming legislative framework, Capella serves as a real-world demonstration of how decentralized systems can strengthen public accountability. By enabling immutable audit trails, real-time data visibility, and verifiable actions from government offices, Capella provides a technological foundation for restoring trust in public institutions.

The project also represents a strategic milestone for the Philippines’ digital future. Through Capella, Substrate and Polkadot technologies are positioned to become the de facto standard for the country’s blockchain infrastructure, offering modularity, scalability, security, and interoperability for nationwide systems. Beyond transparency, Capella lays the groundwork for a broader ecosystem of public-sector innovation, where citizens, developers, and government agencies collaborate on a unified, next-generation digital governance platform.

#### Problem Statement

Lack of transparency in government budgeting and spending makes it difficult for citizens, civil society, and even oversight bodies to track how public funds are allocated and used. This opacity has contributed to corruption, the proliferation of ghost projects, and the misuse of public resources, as seen in cases where infrastructure funds listed in the Department of Public Works and Highways’ budget either did not materialize or were mismanaged, with little visibility into procurement processes, disbursements, and project execution. Additionally, the current system provides minimal opportunity for meaningful citizen participation or accountability, leaving taxpayers unable to effectively question or monitor government expenditures. Inefficiencies in record-keeping and weak audit-traceability further compound these issues, as financial data can be fragmented, delayed, or prone to manipulation, undermining public trust in institutions and the effective management of national resources.

#### Senate Bill No. 1330

Senate Bill No. 1330 seeks to address the problem of opaque government budgeting and spending by leveraging blockchain technology to make financial data transparent, immutable, and publicly accessible. By recording every step of the budget process, from appropriation, fund release, and procurement, to project execution and liquidation on a blockchain ledger, all transactions become time-stamped and tamper-proof, creating a permanent audit trail. This allows citizens, civil society groups, and oversight bodies to independently verify how funds are allocated and spent in real time, reducing opportunities for corruption, ghost projects, and fund mismanagement. 

Blockchain’s decentralized and secure nature also ensures that records cannot be altered retroactively, strengthening accountability and trust in government operations. Furthermore, by making budget data accessible through user-friendly interfaces, SB 1330 empowers citizens to monitor expenditures, participate in oversight, and hold public officials accountable, while streamlining auditing processes and improving overall efficiency in public finance management.
