## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
This project would be an RFP.

### Overview

DeCredit is a credit investigation solution. It's integrated with AI algorithm, big data and blockchain technology to solve credit problems and protect the privacy of personal data. DeCredit establishes credit profile analysis, defines credit agreement standards, and provides more credit investigation services.

There are two key algorithms in our project, 'Credit Scoring' and 'Credit Matching'. They are based on Big Data and AI technology and we want to make them as module of Substrate. So any project related to credit can take reference from our algorithms.

We have run our credit products in Internet for some years any collects lots of data off chain. Now we want to create Decredit to move our solution on chain because we value the credit data from our users and think the data should be private, trackable and immutable. Moreover, we guess scnarios on the blockchain like DeFi could provide more adoption to credit data.

### Community engagement

The tutorial will be published on our Weibo and other social media channels. 


## Future Plans
* Zero-Knowledge proof for public auditing.
* Support for data dynamics
* Deterministic Deletion of data
* Import Smart Contact so that users and storage nodes can reach agreements for each other. And in credit lending scenario, the demand and supply can reach each other through a customized contract.  

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

* What work has been done so far?

The product has been built in Internet for years (files stored in cloud server). Now we want to move it on-chain and in a decentralized manner.

* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?

No.

* Have you applied for other grants so far?

Not yet.
