## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
This project would be an RFP.

### Overview

DeCredit is a credit investigation solution. It's integrated with AI algorithm, big data and blockchain technology to solve credit problems and protect the privacy of personal data. DeCredit establishes credit profile analysis, defines credit agreement standards, and provides more credit investigation services.

There are two key algorithms in our project, 'Credit Scoring' and 'Credit Matching'. They are based on Big Data and AI technology and we want to make them as module of Substrate. So any project related to credit can take reference from our algorithms.

We have run our credit products in Internet for some years any collects lots of data off chain. Now we want to create Decredit to move our solution on chain because we value the credit data from our users and think the data should be private, trackable and immutable. Moreover, we guess scnarios on the blockchain like DeFi could provide more adoption to credit data.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

### Community engagement

The tutorial will be published on our Weibo and other social media channels. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
* Move credit data on-chain. That means we should add storage and privacy modules.
* Make credit scoring and credit matching customized so that the demand and the supply could reach each other in fully decentrlized mode. Thus, to build a credit lending Defi protocl. 

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

* What work has been done so far?
The product has been built in Internet for years. Now we want to move it on-chain and in a decentralized manner.

* Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?
No.

* Have you applied for other grants so far?
Not yet.
