## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Please provide the following:
* A brief description of the project.

Fractapp is a messenger with a cryptocurrency wallet. Cryptocurrency address is hard to remember so users have a problem send cryptocurrency to another user. 
Fractapp creating a simple ecosystem for users. Users can send crypto in chats and use DApp chat-bots. Fractapp will be available on Android and later IOS.

And we have old [DEMO](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cG5PAIVoqh0) for the hackathon.

* An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

 The integration will involve creating a mobile app on Expo (React Native) and backend services.
* Mobile App:
  * Non custodial wallet for Polkadot and Kusama (creating, backup, wallet details, transaction info)
  * Payment chat is a chat for only send cryptocurrency. These milestones haven't support messages in chats. But we will add messages later.
  * Chat-bots for DApp

* Backend services:
  * Push-Notification service is a service which will notify a user about received transactions 
  * Profile service is a service that stores not public information about the user (Nickname, Twitter, Email, Phone Number).

* CBI (Chat-Bot interface):

CBI is the interface between Fractapp and your chat-bots. It can be summarized in the following algorithm:
1. To call the bot, the user must send a request to start. 
2. Bot service must return the user interface (button name, image, and trigger name)
3. The user clicks a button and sends the request with the trigger name to the chat-bot service.
4. Chat-bot processes the user's request by the trigger name.. If the user doesn't need to make a choice then the service returns the transaction which the user will sign. 
5. User signs or cancels transactions.

Example, Decentralized Exchange Bot (exchange DOT <-> KSM):
1. User sends a request to start.
2. Chat-Bot returns response with 2 buttons: DOT, KSM
3. User chooses DOT
4. Chat-Bot returns the text-editor element to the user
5. User sends a request with text (amount)
6. Chat-Bot returns transaction (transaction calling Exchange DApp)
7. User signs and sends transaction 

* An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Polkadot is one of the most interesting blockchain platforms. We want to help users to just join in polkadot and wallet is the most important module in the platform. 

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components

* An overview of the technology stack to be used

Golang, React Native, Polkadot, Kusama


### Ecosystem Fit 
Similar projects: Luno/Polkawallet

We are creating a messenger with a cryptocurrency wallet. This will help the user to interact with each other without a complicated address. Users can exchange currency, use p2p smart-contracts, vote in the DAOs and etc via chat-bots.
