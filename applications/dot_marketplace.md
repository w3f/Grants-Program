## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### **Overview**

Dot Marketplace is a general purpose decentralised marketplace created as a Substrate pallet. 
* Dot Marketplace can be used by any decentralised project to float tasks and invite their community members to execute them for a reward. Its POC was developed during the Polkadot India buildathon (2021).  
* It would be directly integrated in Polkadot JS Apps where such marketplaces could be used to create bounties and tasks that could be fulfilled by community members. 
* The inspiration for Dot Marketplace emerged from our own needs while building Yoda - a protocol that facilitates decentralised app development leveraging open data. Dot Marketplace would be used to create data, services and app marketplaces on Yoda, which would motivate us to maintain this project in the long run.


### **Project Details**

The current scope of work involves two user types: **Customer** and **Service Provider (or Worker)**

- The Customer can post a task and invite bids from Service Providers to fulfill it. 
- The Customer needs to deposit the budgeted amount in an escrow for the task to be published. 
- The Service Provider needs to deposit some token to participate in a bid. If not shortlisted, this bid amount is returned. 
- The Service Provider completes the task and submits it. 
- The Customer accepts the work and the escrowed amount is credited to the Service Providers wallet.
- The Customer rates the Service Provider and visa versa.

NOTE: If the Customer doesn't accept the work, a dispute is raised and it gets resolved in a decentralised court (out of current scope) which will be implemented in the next phase. 

The following diagrams highlight the workflow:

Dot Marketplace is being built as a Substrate pallet. It would include boilerplate code that parachain teams can customize as per their own requirements. We believe this project has the potential to transform community participation, engagement and governance in decentralized projects.

Dot Marketplace will also include frontend UI built on top of the `substrate-front-end-template`, here is a snapshot of the same

```

The current focus is to enhance the existing Substrate pallet and allied code base to get a basic yet functional marketplace up and running:


### **Ecosystem Fit**

We believe this work could be useful for: [Polkadot](https://polkadot.network/), [Kusama](https://kusama.network/), [Moonbeam](https://moonbeam.network/) and any Polkadot parachains/ parathreads interested in including a marketplace. 
* Almost all Parachains/ parathreads would find motivation in encouraging their community members to contribute meaningfully to their roadmap. This can be achieved by utilising a marketplace like Dot Marketplace where technical, marketing or governance centric tasks can be published. And community members are invited to bid for and exectute them. 

**List of Competitors**

Any product or services marketplace would qualify, here are some examples from outside the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. 
1. [Human Protocol](https://www.humanprotocol.org/)
2. [Effect Network](https://effect.ai/)
3. [Ocean Protocol Market](https://market.oceanprotocol.com/)

## Development Status :open_book: 

Dot Marketplace POC was conceptualised and developed during the Polkadot India hackathon. The roadmap listed below comprises of new features that would help take the POC to a minimum viable product (MVP). 

* Here's a link to our [Polkadot India Submission Video](https://youtu.be/xQNOkXQdDnQ)
* We are in touch with Marcin and Raul from the Web 3 Grants and Treasuries team respectively


## **Development Roadmap**ðŸ”©

The development of Dot Marketplace is already underway. 
For the custom pallet (tasking) we are: 
1. Using various Substrate provided traits like - `Currency`, `ExistenceRequirement`, `LockIdentifier`, `LockableCurrency`, `ReservableCurrency` and few more;
2. Using the pre-existing pallets like `assets`, `balances` and `staking`;
3. Implementing custom structs like `TaskDetails` and `TransferDetails`. These in turn are used for various functionalities like `create_task`, `bid_task`, `complete_task` and `approve_task`. A special transfer money function is only initiated once the task cycle gets completed and the escrow funds are released to the worker. 

All the below mentioned milestones are going to be implemented and this application is going to be fully public.
  
NOTE: A barebones UI would also be provided as a part of this submission to help the developer experience the functionality
