# Parallel Finance Open Grant Proposal

-   **Project Name:** Parallel Finance
-   **Team Name:** Parallel
-   **Payment Address:** 0x17816E9A858b161c3E37016D139cf618056CaCD4

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Parallel finance is a decentralized lending/borrowing and staking protocol built on top of the Polkadot ecosystem. Our platform will allow users to earn "double interests" from staking and lending their tokens simultaneously (hence the name "parallel" finance).

### Overview

Our platform offers a few key features and benefits:

-   **Lending and borrowing**: users can lend and borrow assets based on interest rates.
-   **Staking**: users can participate in Polkadot’s network validation and earn rewards.
-   **Earning double interests**: users can choose to stake and lend out their tokens simultaneously based on our new approach.
-   **Powered by Substrate**: our platform benefits from the speed, resiliency and convenient upgradability of Polkadot.

Our project utilizes substrate framework and is built on top of polkadot parachain ecosystem:

-   We built the core interests model and functionalities on substrate runtime
-   We enabled off-chain worker to query the current price feed of DOT and other tokens
-   We will build cross-chain interoperability using XCMP protocol in the near future

**Why are we building Parallel Finance?**

-   We decided to pick this idea because of the rising demand for decentralized lending protocols on Polkadot and Kusama, as well as the lack of token liquidity that comes with staking on the mainnet. We estimate that 50% of all existing DOT and KSM tokens will be staked for blockchain validation with an estimated staking APY of 10-20%. However, the DOT and KSM tokens will lose their liquidity once they are staked to validate the network. Institutions and large token holders have high incentives to use our platform since it will allow them to not only participate in staking, but also generate additional profits through lending, and allow them to use their DOTs and KSMs as payment, or trading assets.

##### What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

-   Our team does not plan on implementing the support for other tokens besides the native DOT and KSM tokens and Stable Coin at the initial launch in order to reduce the risks in cross-collaterals
-   We will not implement a decentralized exchange by ourselves. Instead, we will be focusing on building the lending/borrowing and staking protocol.

### Ecosystem Fit

-   **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?** We are aiming to offer the first decentralized lending/borrowing and staking protocol in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem as a DeFi and a parachain.
-   **Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?** Our target audience are the DOT and KSM token holders who are looking to participate in lending/borrowing, staking and unlocking liquidity for their staked tokens, or generating "double interests" returns by lending and staking simultaneously. This audience would include retail, institutional and large token holders, traders (arbitrage opportunities in DeFi) and network validators. In general, large token holders will have a higher incentive to join the platform earlier as the exchange rate will be more favorable.
-   **What need(s) does your project meet?** Our project helps generate additional interests for token holders, provide assets for borrowing and unlock liquidity for token stakers who can use staked tokens (ex: xDOT) to trade, lend or use as payment.
-   **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**
    -   **If so, how is your project different?** Compound has been a successful and proven model for lending and borrowing assets in a decentralized manner in the Ethereum ecosystem. However, Compound doesn't offer staking services, and there is currently no decentralized lending/borrowing solution launched in the Polkadot ecosystem. Acala Network does offer staking services, but doesn't offer lending/borrowing services. From that perspective, we are a unique solution that combines both services and offers additional interests to our users.
    -   **If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?** We have not yet found a project that will be focusing on generating double interests for token holders through lending and staking.

### Milestone 2 — Enable Staking for DOT and KSM

-   **Estimated Duration:** 8 weeks
-   **FTE:** 2.2
-   **Costs:** 5000 USD

The major deliverable of for this milestone:

-   Implement the modules that allow for staking functionality, which includes
    -   Exchange Rate
    -   28 days locking period for unstaking tokens
    -   Slashing scenarios
    -   Relay tokens to validators
-   Users will be able to stake DOT tokens, and receives xDOT in return. xDOT will then start accruing interests from staking and also be used for lending or transfered elsewhere for payment or trading. Similarly, staked KSM will be converted to xKSM with the same features as xDOT.

|    1.a | Substrate module: Staking DOT       | We will implement the on-chain staking pool for the staking process from the nominators. The full expected functionality is described [here](https://docs.parallel.fi/white-paper#2-nomination-workflow) (IV-1, IV-3, IV-4).                                                                                                                         |
|    1.b | Substrate module: Unstaking DOT     | We will implement a 28 days locking period for the unstaking process of DOT tokens from validators. The full expected functionality is described [here](https://docs.parallel.fi/white-paper#4-delegated-staking) IV-1, IV-4).                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|    1.c | Substrate module: Exchange Rate     | We will implement the process for issuing and trading DOT for xDOT with the users based on our exchange rate. The full expected functionality is described [here](https://docs.parallel.fi/white-paper#4-delegated-staking) (IV-4).                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|    1.d | Substrate module: Slashing Scenario | Staking tokens does have inherent risks of being slashed. We will implement our model that will change the exchange rate in case of slashing scenarios. The full expected functionality is described [here](https://docs.parallel.fi/white-paper#6-slash-insurance) (IV-6).                                                                                                                                              |
|    1.e | Substrate module: KSM | Since DOT and KSM will have similar code, we will mainly transfer over some of the previous development to allow for KSM staking.
|    2   | Validator evaluation schema         | We will design the validator evaluation schema to select the outstanding validators. The full expected functionality is described [here](https://docs.parallel.fi/white-paper#2-validator-choosing-strategy) (IV-2).                                                                                                                         |
|    3. | Integration with front-end          | We will integrate our existing front end to the finalized substrate backend.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|    4. | Article/Tutorial                    | We will create an article and a demo video that will explain how users can start using the platform for staking DOT and KSM. Additionally, we will also create tutorials for users to explain how they can earn "double interests" through staking and lending at the same time via xDOT and xKSM. |
|    5. | Testing and Documentation           | While we develop our module, we will ensure that our code has significant test coverage (>80%) to ensure quality and provide explanations on how the functions work for the community to review, as well as craft test guides.                                                                       |

* We will implement more quantitative user testing with A/B tests, web analytics, and heatmap once we have more adoption (>100-200 DAU) in order to get more significant insights (not part of v1 deliverables).  

## Future Plans

**Community Development**:

-   In the short term, we will focus on acquiring the early users for our platform, who are large token holders and institutions. The exchange rate will be lower initially as the pool size and number of blocks are lower, so there's a strong incentive for larger players to deposit their tokens early on. As the Kusama and Polkadot mainnets are approaching, we will be forming partnership with validators who might be interested in forming partnerships or use our platform to gain liquidity on their staked tokens.
-   We will frequently post on social media (Twitter, Medium, Youtube) to provide development news and video tutorials regarding our platform. We will also work with influencers, who can break down complex concepts and provide clear guidance to the mainstream users on how to use our platform.
-   Our long term plan is to provide a suite of products that will allow users to earn superior interests with their assets on our Defi platform, as we truly believe in the benefits of decentralization and allowing more mainstream investors to participate in the financial economy.

**Product Development**:

-   This is our tentative development roadmap for the rest of this year:
