Gluon uses a new approach to prevent such issues.</p><p>Gluon is a TaaS (Trust-as-a-Service) application that provides hardware crypto wallet services to crypto users. Our main goal is to create an all-in-one private key manager for Polkadot ecosystem blockchains.</p><p>Features:</p><ul><li>Passwordless. Users won&#x27;t have to take responsibility for backup mnemonic phrases. Social recovery is available for users who have lost all their authentication devices.</li><li>Gluon manages Schnorr Multisig Keys that are randomly distributed and encrypted by hardware-secure-modules (HSM). We call them TEA nodes.</li><li>Users only need to submit a transaction to Gluon, and it will take over the signing and committing to blockchains.</li><li>Leverages popular biometric technologies in mobile devices to attain better user experiences without compromising security.</li></ul><p>Gluon is built into a WebAssembly module loaded and ran inside the T-rust framework (they are both TEA projects). Gluon is an application (we call TeaLeaf); T-rust is a framework (TeaTree). T-rust contains layer1 and layer2; Layer1 is a blockchain built using Substrate, while Layer2 is an exceptionally designed mini OS along with WebAssembly modules that run on wasm runtime powered by <a href="https://wascc.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WaSCC</a>. Gluon also contains layer1 and layer2. Layer1 is a Substrate pellet running inside Tea Layer1 blockchain, and layer2 is a set of WebAssembly actors running in every TEA node&#x27;s TeaRuntime.</p><p>Gluon serves all Polkadot ecosystem dApps and other blockchains as an entry point (portal); it is transparent to other client chains. There is no integration needed.</p><p>We designed and developed Gluon to:</p><ul><li>Lower the barrier to blockchain end-users; improve user experiences.</li><li>Protect users&#x27; crypto assets.</li><li>Demonstrate the potential of the Substrate framework and TEA project.</li></ul><blockquote><p>Please provide the following:</p><ul><li>A brief description of the project.</li><li>An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.</li><li>An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.</li></ul></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="unique-features-of-gluon">Unique features of Gluon<a href="#unique-features-of-gluon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Unique features of Gluon" title="Direct link to Unique features of Gluon">​</a></h4><p>From a users point of view, Gluon works just like a hardware wallet, but with a few differences:</p><ul><li>A traditional hardware wallet is just one single hardware secure module (HSM), but Gluon is a group of potentially thousands of HSM running consensus together to protect clients&#x27; assets. (Every TEA Mining Node is an HSM which can be considered as a hardware wallet)</li><li>Users need both a Polkadot extension and a Gluon mobile app to access their Gluon account as 2FA.</li><li>Users can transfer authentication factors from one device to another without backing up and restoring mnemonic phases.</li><li>If users lose both their computer (web auth) and phone (mobile auth), social recovery can still protect and recover their new accounts&#x27; crypto assets.</li><li>Users only need to submit a transaction then Gluon will submit the signature to the client blockchain without further user interaction.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="key-distribution-and-protection">Key distribution and protection<a href="#key-distribution-and-protection" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Key distribution and protection" title="Direct link to Key distribution and protection">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tearust/gluon-docs/d5526500c3a27deaa36fc0c0e4a2f2b8e18b1c60/res/Gluonwallet_p123.svg" alt="p1 p2 p3" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Gluon generates Polkadot accounts for users using the 2-out-of-3 Schnorr Threshold Multsig Algorithm implemented by Schnorrkel. The account public key is aggregated from the 3 key pairs while the private keys are kept by 3 individual parties. They are called P1, P2, and P3.</p><p>Among them, P1 is a single sign key stored in the users&#x27; mobile phones. Both P2 and P3 are Schnorr multisig keys. Gluon owns P2 for additional security policy control, while Guardians (assigned by the User) owns P3.</p><p>P2 is a Schnorr threshold multisig key, which means instead of a single signer, a group of signers control P2. For example, we call them key-pieces such as P2-1, P2-2, P2-3, and so on. They are separately generated and stored by different TEA nodes. Multiple TEA nodes distribute the private key of each signer as the replica. We do not allow a single TEA node to hold more than one key piece of any P2 to prevent any TEA node has enough key-pieces to reach the multisig threshold. This policy also guarantees better distribution of key-pieces over TEA nodes. The signature algorithm is implemented by Schnorrkel too.</p><p>P3 is also a Schnorr threshold multisig key but each key-pieces owned by different guardians. Users need to assign their friends or legal entities as guardians. K of n guardians could sign the social recovery transaction to restore a user&#x27;s account if it lost its P1. This process is called <a href="https://www.parity.io/social-recovery-on-substrate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Social Recovery</a>.</p><p>P1 is stored in the users&#x27; Gluon mobile app. P1 will never be exposed beyond the phone, even when upgrading devices. However, Gluon doesn&#x27;t require users to take responsibility to backup mnemonic phrases. When upgrading to a new phone, the Gluon app can transfer P1 securely to the new device without exposing it to the network. If users lose their phones, there is no way to restore P1 because there are no backup mnemonic phrases. Lost or being hacked of P1 does not lead to a loss of assets, as one can use P2+P3 for recovery, and bad actors would need two keys to access crypto assets in the case of a leak. As mentioned above, Gluon can transfer all assets to one&#x27;s new account by running a social recovery process.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hardware-secure-module">Hardware Secure Module<a href="#hardware-secure-module" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hardware Secure Module" title="Direct link to Hardware Secure Module">​</a></h4><p>TEA nodes are HSM (Hardware Secure Module). One can consider commonly used hardware wallets as special-purpose HSM, but TEA nodes are a general-purpose HSM that can do much more. The secret will never be exposed outside of hardware-protected TEA node&#x27;s RAM nor saved to any storage media persistently. When transferring secrets between TEA nodes (for example, distributing replica), every TEA nodes will run Remote Attestation before an end to end encryption and send. When using P2 co-signing a transaction, the TEA Node will query the layer1 blockchain to verify the signing conditions first and then sign the transaction inside HSM. No secret leaves the HSM except the digital signature. Each co-signer sign using its holding key-piece to a signature-piece. These signature-pieces get aggregated in layer-1 blockchain to become a single signature. As long as the number of co-signers reaches the threshold, this signature can pass verification by Polkadot.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="access-control-logic">Access control logic<a href="#access-control-logic" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Access control logic" title="Direct link to Access control logic">​</a></h4><p>Polkadot allows unlocking User&#x27;s DOT based on 2 of 3 mutisig from P1 P2 and P3. Gluon has no control over P1 (owned by the User) and P3 (owned by the User&#x27;s friend - guardians). If a user no longer trusts Gluon, it can ask its guardians to sign P3 along with its P1, and the User still has full control over its assets. If a user lost its P1, it could create a new P1 then recover its assets by running the social recovery process by P2 and P3. If a user wants to update its guardians&#x27; list, it can create a new P3 since P1 and P2 are available.</p><p>P1 is stored in users&#x27; mobile apps. Gluon mobile app uses general mobile security protections to protect P1. Such as Biometric ID, Symmetric encryption (6 digits user input passcode), Hardware security chip for some particular model when available. P1 along won&#x27;t be more secure than other modern crypto wallet mobile apps. That&#x27;s why we have additional P2 and P3 to protect the User&#x27;s crypto assets.</p><p>P2 is the only key owned by Gluon. When a user requests to sign a transaction, each TEA node that holds a key-piece will run authentication logic separately. The authentication logic includes</p><ul><li>Verifying web and mobile 2FA. The User has to submit a signing request using both the Polkadot browser extension and Gluon mobile app.</li><li>For spending transactions, verify the daily limit or other constraints set by the User in layer1. For example, when the User claims loss of P1 and sets its assets in the Social Recovery frozen period, Gluon will suspend the request.</li><li>For social recovery transactions, verify the guardians&#x27; signature follow the predefined logic. For example, suppose a user lost both their computer and mobile phone (all 2FA). In that case, additional requirements apply to social recovery processes such as time window, sequence, or geolocation to mitigate phishing attacks.  </li></ul><p>Given such logic run on the Gluon Pellet (on-chain) and Gluon Wasm Actors (off-chain), in the future, we can easily add more complex logic without on-chain limitations.</p><p>P3 is only used for Social Recovery. Because of Schnorr Mutisig Algorithm, the guardians&#x27; list never exposes in the clear on the blockchain. Even the guardians themself won&#x27;t know they are selected guardians or know other guardians in the same group. There is little chance for guardians to collude and sign P3 without the User&#x27;s permission.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="user-experiences">User experiences<a href="#user-experiences" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to User experiences" title="Direct link to User experiences">​</a></h4><p>From the end user&#x27;s point of view, Gluon is a mobile app and a web extension. The end-user needs to install the Polkadot web extension on their browser to visit any dApp sites to generate transactions to be signed. They also will need to install a Gluon mobile app as a decentralized 2FA (not the traditional centralized 2FA).</p><p>Users can go to the Gluonwallet.com website or any other compatible dApp to create a transaction. The web extension will generate a transaction like a QR code on the web page. Users will use the Gluon mobile app to scan this QR code, verify the transaction details, then fingerprint-unlock the partial signing on the phone. Once the phone sends the partial signature to the Gluon network, TEA nodes will multisign the same tx using P2. Once two partial signatures are complete, they are aggregated and committed to the client blockchain to continue processing the transaction.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="relationship-between-gluon-and-t-rust">Relationship between Gluon and T-rust<a href="#relationship-between-gluon-and-t-rust" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Relationship between Gluon and T-rust" title="Direct link to Relationship between Gluon and T-rust">​</a></h4><p>From the miners&#x27; point of view, Gluon is a dApp that runs on top of the T-rust framework. When compiling the source code, a WebAssembly file &quot;gluon.wasm&quot; is generated. This wasm file is loaded to the miner&#x27;s TEA node by adding Gluon.wasm file hash to their TEA nodes&#x27; manifest file. Miners can load this wasm module from IPFS directly. Once &quot;gluon.wasm&quot; is loaded into TEA runtime, this TEA node becomes a TEA hardware wallet capability provider.</p><p>Gluon.wasm only handles crypto wallet related logic. All other consensuses, security, network, and hardware validation happens in the T-rust framework.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1120/1*2O7WDwTwH4DlIr4zbOMxng.png" alt="relationship tea" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="gluon-and-t-rusts-root-of-trust-and-pot-proof-of-trust-consensus">Gluon and T-rust&#x27;s root of trust and PoT (Proof of Trust) consensus<a href="#gluon-and-t-rusts-root-of-trust-and-pot-proof-of-trust-consensus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Gluon and T-rust&#x27;s root of trust and PoT (Proof of Trust) consensus" title="Direct link to Gluon and T-rust&#x27;s root of trust and PoT (Proof of Trust) consensus">​</a></h4><p>T-rust is a layer2 trusted computing solution on top of a Substrate-based blockchain (layer1). Unlike most blockchain, whose root-of-trust comes from cryptography and consensus, T-rust introduces hardware root-of-trust as the third dimension. Unlike most other blockchains that make consensus on the result, T-rust makes consensus on the proof of trust that comes from hardware TPM chips. Using hardware RoT makes the consensus much more efficient than many blockchains. T-rust can run complex or privacy-sensitive computations, which are not likely possible in other blockchains. Distributed storage of private keys needs both privacy and complex computing, so Gluon is an ideal dApp running on top of T-rust. Gluon and T-rust are two TEA Projects.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1120/1*5cLoCE4mLRw7hhDjcuaAxA.png" alt="root of trust" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-other-blockchains-or-dapps-integrate-with-gluon">How other blockchains or dApps integrate with Gluon<a href="#how-other-blockchains-or-dapps-integrate-with-gluon" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How other blockchains or dApps integrate with Gluon" title="Direct link to How other blockchains or dApps integrate with Gluon">​</a></h4><p>There is nothing that needs to be done for other blockchains when integrating with Gluon as long as the client blockchain supports Schnorr Multisig.  Gluon is transparent to other client blockchains. Gluon is virtually a client who commits the signed transaction and listens to block events. Polkadot will support off-line Schnorr Multisig very soon.</p><p>For other dApps, integrating with Gluon is as simple as adding one js API. This js API does three things:</p><ul><li>Gathering input transaction details and show in a QR code. Prompt the User to scan this QR code using Gluon mobile app.</li><li>Sending the hash of transaction and client_id in a TEA transaction to the TEA blockchain.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ui-mockups">UI mockups<a href="#ui-mockups" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to UI mockups" title="Direct link to UI mockups">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/tearust/gluon-docs/blob/master/res/typical-workflow.png?raw=true" alt="typical workflow" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The diagram above shows a typical UI workflow, which is signing a DOT spending transaction.</p><p>Users start a task from the web browser. It could be the Gluon web portal or any dApps&#x27; website embedded with our js API. A hash of the transaction detail is sent to Gluon TeaLeaf. A QR code is shown on the web page for the paired Gluon mobile app to scan.</p><p>After scanning the QR code, the Gluon mobile app shows the transaction&#x27;s detail for users to confirm visually. Users approve this transaction by fingerprinting and six digits wallet passcode.</p><p>Gluon mobile app partially signs the transaction using P1. Both the signature and transaction details are sent to Gluon TeaLeaf to continue.</p><p>Gluon TeaLeaf takes over the rest of the task by verifying and signing using P2. Finally, Gluon TeaLeaf sends the signature by P1 and P2 to Polkadot to complete the transaction.</p><p>The User will receive the confirmation event of a completed task.</p><p>All other tasks are pretty much the same workflow.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technology-stack-to-be-used">Technology stack to be used<a href="#technology-stack-to-be-used" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technology stack to be used" title="Direct link to Technology stack to be used">​</a></h4><p>T-rust is a bit more complicated.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teas-four-pillars">TEA&#x27;s four pillars<a href="#teas-four-pillars" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to TEA&#x27;s four pillars" title="Direct link to TEA&#x27;s four pillars">​</a></h5><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/tearust/tea-docs/raw/main/res/s8.jpg" alt="four pillars" class="img_ev3q">
In general, TEA is based on four technologies:</p><ul><li>Substrate: This is layer 1 of T-rust. The blockchain runs consensus on Proof-of-Trust, and immutably stores, processes, and verifies PoT (the hashes from the hardware chips).</li><li>IPFS: This is the file system and network layer of T-rust. All public code and data are stored in IPFS, but all secrets are kept inside TEA modules (the HSM).</li><li>Trusted Computing: This is where the hardware root of trust comes from. We use the TPM chips inside the TEA module (HSM) to generate Proof of Trust.</li><li>WebAssembly: All running executable code is in wasm format and runs inside secure wasm runtime except for our OS, runtime, and system providers.</li></ul><p>90% of the source code is written in Rust. The other 6% is written in JS and the remaining 4% in Golang.</p><p>For more detail on the TEA project and T-rust framework, you may visit teaproject.org.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prior-works-and-demo">Prior works and demo<a href="#prior-works-and-demo" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prior works and demo" title="Direct link to Prior works and demo">​</a></h4><p>Gluon is a dApp and a wasm module running on top of T-rust.

The idea originally came to the team leader, Kevin Zhang, seven years ago when working as the CTO of iHealthLabs. Utilizing patients&#x27; health data for scientific research while preventing health data breaches has always been a major problem. He initially tried to solve the dilemma using blockchain but realized that the existing blockchain technologies were far too slow to be practical. He then decided to add the root of trust alongside existing blockchain cryptography + consensus. This is the hardware root of trust. TEA uses existing mature Trusted Computing technologies to provide secure computing services to client blockchains without requiring specialized CPU features such as Phala&#x27;s (TEE) Intel SGX CPU or Bitcoin&#x27;s ASIC CPU. Besides the Tensorflow demo app on TEA, making a practical crypto wallet can demonstrate how TEA can do better, so they started the Gluon.
