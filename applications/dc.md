## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- DC: Decentralized Cloud
- DC is a DePIN,We will build a decentralized network infrastructure for developers very convenient to develop decentralized applications with their Web2.0  development experience.And the user experience of using DApps based on DC is just like using the Apps based on Web2.0.
- We provide developers with a complete gRPC interface and client SDK to enable rapid integration with the DC network services for the development of DApps.
- The DC network is primarily divided into two main components: DCStorage and DCChain. DCStorage offers decentralized cloud service functionalities for DApps, while DCChain provides consensus services for the entire DC network. It is a public blockchain developed on Substrate. We have primarily developed a Pallet called DCNode on top of Substrate to provide consensus services for the DC network. DCStorage relies on the network consensus provided by DCChain to offer data consistency and reliability for decentralized services to users.
- Our development of the DC network based on Substrate is primarily driven by the following reasons: 1. We are believers in decentralization and firmly believe that it will become mainstream; 2. Users should have control over their own data, with all applications or platforms merely serving as tools; 3. To enable users of current web2.0 to seamlessly use web3.0 DApps with zero barriers; 4. To allow developers who are accustomed to developing centralized applications to create DApps with user experiences that rival those of centralized applications, without needing to understand blockchain or other decentralized underlying technologies.

### Project Details

- The development of the DC network start at the end of 2019. It has now entered the final debugging stage, and we plan to release the public test network at the End of December 2023.
- The DC network provides a rich set of decentralized basic services for DApps, including decentralized file storage services, decentralized database storage services, decentralized storage of user blogs and comments,subscription Routing Service, account and password login services similar to Web2.0, and real-time communication routing services between users. This allows developers to focus on business logic development, and even eliminates the need to understand blockchain technology.
- The DC network is divided into two main parts: DCChain and DCStorage. DCChain is a public chain developed based on Substrate. We  developed a pallet called DCNode on the basis of Substrate to provide consensus services for the entire DC network. DCStorage is a decentralized cloud service node, and all code runs in Intel's SGX Enclave, using remote attestation to ensure that the code running on the node is trustworthy. It  has the following functions: providing decentralized cloud services for DApp; submitting data that needs to form a consensus to DCChain instead of users; supervising other DCStorage nodes based on the consensus on DCChain; responsible for providing storage reliability monitoring and active backup services for the data stored on the node to ensure that there are at least five copies of data in the network to ensure data security; using the available storage space owned by the user as a credential, the DCStorage node verifies the legality of each user's operation and is responsible for submitting the result data of the user's operation to the chain, avoiding the need for users to wait for each operation to be chained, and achieving real-time response for users during use.
- DCChain and DCStorage can both undergo upgrades through on-chain governance, allowing the entire ecosystem to evolve autonomously.
- The DCChain will focus solely on providing consensus services for the DC ecosystem and will not support developers deploying smart contracts on the chain. However, we will strive to integrate the DC network as a parallel chain into Polkadot. If developers need to, they can call various features on other parallel chains through cross-chain messagesï¼›
- The DCStorage's data exchange is primarily based on the IPFS protocol.
- To facilitate developers in quickly developing DApps, we provide a set of client SDKs. Developers can develop DApps just like developing Web2.0 applications without the need to understand blockchain technology or the underlying technology of the DC network. They only need to refer to the SDK interfaces mentioned by the DC network to quickly develop DApps. Combined with DCStorage's service client SDK, DApps can provide decentralized file storage, decentralized database access, peer-to-peer communication between users, and other services.
- We provide developers with a complete set of DApp independent development environments based on Docker. Developers can develop and debug DApps in the local development environment. Once the development is completed, they only need to switch the DApp's access to the blockchain from the development environment to the DC mainnet in order to publish it on various app markets for users to download and use.
- During the use of DApps based on the DC network, there is minimal interaction with the blockchain (most interactions are handled by DCStorage). This ensures that the user experience is consistent with that of centralized applications based on Web2.0. Users do not need to understand blockchain technology and can use DApps in the same way as Web2.0 applications without being aware of digital assets.
- The Web3 ecosystem needs Web2 functionality that keeps the underlying system decentralized.
  
### Ecosystem Fit

- The DC network focuses on providing decentralized cloud service infrastructure and complete Web3.0 application solutions. By significantly reducing the technical barriers for developers, we aim to encourage more developers to participate in the development of Web3.0 applications. Additionally, Web3.0 apps developed on the DC network can fully retain the user experience and usage habits of Web2.0, effectively eliminating the barriers for ordinary users to use Web3.0 applications. This allows more users to access Web3.0 applications, thereby promoting the development of the Web3.0 ecosystem.
- The DC network itself focuses solely on the construction of decentralized cloud services. In order to ensure the performance and purity of its functions to the greatest extent, it does not provide smart contract functionality. However, we are working to integrate the DC network as a parallel chain into Polkadot. If developers need to, they can access various distinctive features on other parallel chains through cross-chain access. Our goal is to introduce more daily applications with non-financial attributes (such as storage, blogging, social networking, and IoT access) as Web3.0 applications. When these applications require financial attributes or other distinctive functionalities, they can call the functionalities on other chains within the Polkadot ecosystem through XCMP messaging.
- In general, we aim to onboard the majority of current Web2.0 users into the Polkadot ecosystem. At the same time, we will also need the distinctive features of various parallel chains within the Polkadot ecosystem to better provide more comprehensive decentralized services for developers and users of applications based on the DC network.
