- **Team Name:** Hypha Hashed Partners
- **Payment Address:** bc1q7axtazzhsdttextp0qspueaagv4pgfm5l9ne64 (BTC)

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Proposal for the RFP titled [Social Recovery Wallet](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/open/social-recovery-wallet.md).

### Overview

We develop Flutter wallets. We have experience developing social recovery wallets in Flutter. We develop the [SEEDS Light wallet](https://github.com/JoinSEEDS/seeds_light_wallet), found at the [Android store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.joinseeds.seedswallet) and the [iOS store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/seeds-light-wallet/id1507143650). 

We have implemented social recovery in that Flutter wallet. It operates on [Telos](https://telos.net). 

### Project Details

#### Recovery Screen Mockups / Descriptions

These screens include:
- Splash and main screen (mockup)

- Set / Remove social recovery accounts ("guardians")

- Recover account screens - generate recovery link to send to guardians

- Recovery wait countdown screen

- Process recovery URL to recover someone's account (see video of existig wallet)
- Cancel recovery - prevent maliciuous actors (see video of existing wallet)

The process overall will look similar to the existing Seeds Light Wallet process

#### Recovery Link
To make recovery easy for a user, we provide a deep link users can share with their guardians.

To make recovery more difficult to attack, we require the user to send the link to their recoverers outside the wallet. 
    
The recoverers then just click on the recovery link. 
    
#### Sign and Broadcast
In addition to social recovery, we will also migrate our Sign and Broadcast feature. It scans the QR code provided by polkadot.{js}, signs it, and broadcasts it to the network. 

#### Improvement on Parity Signer
Parity Signer scans QR codes that are produced by polkadot.{js}. Parity Signer is a fully airgapped wallet, so the payload is signed on the device and the signed QR code is scanned back into browser plugin to be broadcast. 

Our wallet will scan the same QR codes, but broadcast it to skip the step of having to scan the QR back in. Scanning QR codes from mobile back into a webcam is an extra step. It is the most time consuming part because you have to align the phone over the webcam correctly, and it always takes another second or two to focus on the QR code. 

With social recovery fully implemented, wallet users can be more confident leaving their mobile wallets online.

## Scoping
- **_Features_** - All steps of the [Social recovery on Substrate](https://www.parity.io/blog/social-recovery-on-substrate/) article will be implemented. 
- **_Deployment_** - We will deploy the wallet to iOS and Android application stores. 
- **_Maintenance_** - We will maintain the components on the mainline releases of Substrate for no less than 2 years

### Team's experience

We have deployed and implemented the Seeds Light Wallet. Nikolaus Heger and Gerardo Guijarro specced, implemented, and deployed social recovery for the Seeds Light Wallet. We also implemented the smart contracts. Smart contracts were deployed on Telos, an EOSIO fork. Hypha is a Hashed Network launch partner.  

### Team Code Repos

Hypha develops two products, the Hypha DAO, and the SEEDS regenerative currency, DAO, and ecosystem.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have started research of how to integrate Polkadot JS into the flutter app. 

https://github.com/JoinSEEDS/seeds_light_wallet/tree/feature/polkadot1

We have deployed a full implementation in the Seeds Light Wallet

We created a video showing off how the feature works on Telos - it's going to be a bit different due to the way Polkadot recovery pallet works, but 90% of the design and specifications are going to be the same (wait on recover, prevent hacks, set up guardians). It's less than 5 minutes, enjoy!

## Future Plans
We plan to continue enhancing the wallet. Many of our users are migrating to Hashed Network and will require Flutter modules for custom pallets. 

### Other Pallets
Support for multisig and proxy pallets, plus other similar pallets.

### Enhanced Sign and Broadcast
Sign and Broadcast also establishes a trusted link between the browser and the device. The transaction results are reported on both the device and the browser. This feature uses the Flutter implementation of [Anchor Link](https://github.com/greymass/eosio-signing-request).
