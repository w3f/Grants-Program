This service is specifically tailored to serve as a robust data layer for NFT-oriented dApps, leveraging the simplicity of GraphQL and REST API.</p><p>In the current landscape, developers face challenges interacting with Uniques and Assets on Statemine due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of querying fungible and non-fungible assets on AssetHub. AssetHub Indexer aims to address these challenges by providing a user-friendly GraphQL interface, thus reducing the time and effort required to query these assets.</p><p>The key advantages of the AssetHub Indexer include
its focus on ease of use,
versatility for a broad range of use cases, and
its commitment to bringing Statemine utilization &amp; documentation closer to developers.
Furthermore, the AssetHub Indexer is a completely decentralized, open-source solution that respects user privacy by not collecting user data.</p><p>By reducing the time required to query assets and providing a more user-friendly interface, the AssetHub Indexer aims to foster the growth and development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem in Polkadot.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>The AssetHub Indexer is a state-of-the-art infrastructure tool designed to address developers&#x27; challenges when querying NFTs from the chain. Currently, developers are limited to querying NFTs in batches from RPC nodes, which can be time-consuming and inefficient for customer-facing products. This limitation often results in long waiting times and heavy device data loads.</p><p>To overcome these challenges, we have developed the AssetHub Indexer. This tool leverages the power of GraphQL to provide a more efficient and user-friendly interface for developers. With the AssetHub Indexer, developers can easily query NFTs and build on top of the new <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/nfts/src/lib.rs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFTs pallet by Parity</a>, opening up a wide range of potential use cases, such as creating <a href="https://fandom.deno.dev" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fandom shops</a> for art.</p><p>Recognizing that many web developers may not have extensive experience with GraphQL, we have also built a TypeScript-based SDK that can be easily imported into any existing project. This SDK simplifies interacting with Uniques and Assets on Statemine, making it more accessible for developers of all skill levels.</p><p>The AssetHub Indexer uses TypeScript and leverages the Squid framework (ArrowSquid) for data processing. It interacts with a Postgres database and provides a GraphQL interface for querying data. The project structure includes directories for generated model/server definitions, server extensions, data type definitions, and mapping modules. It also uses environment variables defined in a .env file or supplied by a shell for configuration.</p><p>Currently, the AssetHub Indexer allows developers to interact with Uniques and Assets on Statemine using GraphQL. The project is designed to be as simple as possible, ensuring all tasks can be done quickly and without extended searching. We aim to reduce the time necessary to query fungible and non-fungible assets on AssetHub, making it easier for developers to build innovative and user-friendly decentralized apps.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="architecture-">Architecture 🏗<a href="#architecture-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Architecture 🏗" title="Direct link to Architecture 🏗">​</a></h4><p>The architecture of the AssetHub Indexer is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, ensuring a seamless interaction with Uniques and Assets on Statemine.</p><p>At the core of our architecture is TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language. TypeScript ensures robustness and reliability in our codebase, allowing us to catch errors early in the development process and write more maintainable code.</p><p>To handle data processing, we leverage the ArrowSquid framework. ArrowSquid is a powerful tool allowing us to process and index blockchain data efficiently. It provides a set of utilities for defining and running data processing tasks, making handling complex data processing requirements easier.</p><p>Our project interacts with a Postgres database, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language. Postgres provides us with the robustness, scalability, and performance we need to handle large amounts of data.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/SyLxL56uh.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>On the architectural level, we have a few layers, as described in the picture above.
We need to obtain the data for the correct function of our indexer. AssetHub indexer combines the SubSquid archive (the pre-indexed storage) and RPC node for the new data. When the indexer obtains a new event, it is automatically processed by the defined handler. As previously mentioned, we processed data stored in the Postgres DB. </p><p>To expose the data to clients, we provide a GraphQL interface. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with our existing data. It allows clients to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, making it easier to evolve and enabling powerful developer tools.</p><p>The project structure is organized into several key directories. The &#x27;src/generated&#x27; directory contains model/server definitions created by codegen. The &#x27;src/server-extension&#x27; directory contains a module with custom type-graphql-based resolvers. The &#x27;src/types&#x27; directory contains data type definitions for chain events and extrinsics created by typegen. The &#x27;src/mappings&#x27; directory contains the mapping module. The &#x27;lib&#x27; directory contains compiled js files, reflecting the structure of the &#x27;src&#x27; directory.</p><p>Finally, the project configures environment variables, defined in a .env file or supplied by a shell. This approach allows us to easily manage and change the configuration without altering the codebase.</p><p>The second state-of-the-art is our Client-first SDK called Uniquery. As we can see in the picture below, the only thing that client applications need to do is import the Uniquery package via ESM/CJS (Javascript targets). Once we have the Uniquery package, we can access query builder implementation (such as <code>client.getCollectionById(id)</code>). Additionally, because many developers are familiar with REST API, we build a similar fetch strategy without needing a third party (every client fetches data directly from SubSquid). The REST looks like this: <code>$fetch(/collectionById/${id}).</code></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkMKagJt3.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technology-stack-">Technology Stack 💻<a href="#technology-stack-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technology Stack 💻" title="Direct link to Technology Stack 💻">​</a></h4><ul><li>TypeScript</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Docker</li><li>SubSquid (ArrowSquid for Substrate)</li><li>Postgres</li><li>GraphQL</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>The AssetHub Indexer is a crucial addition to the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem. It addresses the challenges developers often encounter when building on top of runtime pallets, particularly when interacting with Uniques, NFTs, and Assets on Statemine. The AssetHub Indexer provides a comprehensive NFT-oriented data solution, simplifying the development process and enhancing the efficiency of dApps within the ecosystem.</p><p>Our solution stands out within the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem due to its user-friendly GraphQL interface and TypeScript-based SDK. These features streamline interaction with Uniques and Assets on Statemine, reducing the complexity of querying these assets.</p><p>Moreover, the AssetHub Indexer is designed to be versatile, supporting a broad range of use cases. Developers can also leverage our <a href="https://github.com/kodadot/sub-scaffold" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sub-scaffold UI</a> template to bootstrap their projects quickly. This template, a forkable Substrate dev stack focused on rapid product iterations, accelerates the development process and allows developers to focus on creating innovative and user-friendly dApps, rather than getting bogged down in the initial setup.</p><p>Our target audience for this proposal includes Web3 projects and blockchain developers, whether they are just starting out or already established within the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem. We believe the AssetHub Indexer can provide significant value to these developers, enabling them to build more efficient and user-friendly dApps like <a href="https://kodadot.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KodaDot</a>.</p><p>AssetHub also plays significant for the <a href="https://kodadot.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KodaDot</a> NFT marketplace, which is one of the main consumers for this indexer. Thanks to that, developers can find real-world examples of how to effectively make GraphQL queries and learn more about using Uniquery.</p><p>Regarding competition within the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem, the AssetHub Indexer differentiates itself through its focus on NFT-oriented data solutions, user-friendly interface, and commitment to simplifying the development process. Including the sub-scaffold UI template further sets it apart, providing developers with a ready-to-use foundation for their projects. Moreover, the AssetHub Indexer is already being utilized by <a href="https://twitter.com/SubsocialChain/status/1674435226334904320" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Subsocial</a> and KodaDot, demonstrating its practical application and effectiveness. We plan to further promote the indexer within the ecosystem to onboard new developers and explore new solutions. These factors position the AssetHub Indexer as a unique and valuable tool within the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem, ultimately serving as a Common Good solution.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members-in-order-of-joining-time">Team members (In order of joining time)<a href="#team-members-in-order-of-joining-time" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members (In order of joining time)" title="Direct link to Team members (In order of joining time)">​</a></h3><ul><li>Matej Nemček - Project Lead</li><li>Viktor Valaštín - Developer</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact-">Contact 📞<a href="#contact-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact 📞" title="Direct link to Contact 📞">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong>  Matej Nemček</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong>  <a href="mailto:matej.nemcek@geefu.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">matej.nemcek@geefu.net</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong>  Proletarska cesta 4, 1000 Ljubljana, Slovenia, Europe</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong>  GenArt, Matej Nemček s.p.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p><strong>Matej Nemček</strong> is the Founder and CEO of <a href="https://kodadot.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">KodaDot</a>.

The result of this work can be seen in the <a href="https://subkey.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">web-based Subkey</a> tool.</p><p>We learned about the Grants Program through a personal recommendation. We believe that our project aligns well with the program&#x27;s goals, and we are excited about the potential to further contribute to the Polkadot ecosystem.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/edit/master/applications/kodadot_assethub_nft_indexer_statemine_statemint.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="theme-edit-this-page"><svg fill="currentColor" height="20" width="20" viewBox="0 0 40 40" class="iconEdit_Z9Sw" aria-hidden="true"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col lastUpdated_vwxv"></div></div></footer></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#overview" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Overview</a></li><li><a href="#project-details" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Project Details</a></li><li><a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Ecosystem Fit</a></li><li><a href="#team-" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Team 👥</a><ul><li><a href="#team-members-in-order-of-joining-time" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Team members (In order of joining time)</a></li><li><a href="#contact-" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Contact 📞</a></li><li><a href="#legal-structure" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Legal Structure</a></li><li><a href="#teams-experience" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Team&#39;s experience</a></li><li><a href="#team-code-repos" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Team Code Repos</a></li><li><a href="#team-linkedin-profiles-" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Team LinkedIn Profiles 🧑‍🎓</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#development-status-" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Development Status 📖</a></li><li><a href="#development-roadmap-" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Development Roadmap 🔩</a><ul><li><a href="#overview-1" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Overview</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#milestone-1---assethub-indexer-implementation-first-part" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Milestone 1 -
