> See the [Open Grants Program Process](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/#pencil-process) on how to submit a proposal.

* **Project Name:** Name of your project (e.g. DuoSwap Module)
* **Team Name:** Legal name of your team (e.g. Duo)
* **Payment Address:** BTC or Ethereum (DAI) payment address. We don't accept payments for the program in other currencies at this stage. (e.g. 123mp123...)


> ⚠️ *The combination of your GitHub account submitting the application and the payment address above will be your unique identifier during the program. Please keep them safe.*

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
  * A brief description of your project.
  * An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
* What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  * This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
* What need(s) does your project meet? 
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem? 
  * If so, how is your project different?
  * If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Team :busts_in_silhouette:

### Team members
* Name of team leader
* Names of team members	

### Contact
* **Contact Name:** Full name of the contact person in your team
* **Contact Email:** Contact email (e.g. john@duo.com)
* **Website:**

### Legal Structure 
* **Registered Address:** Address of your registered legal entity, if available. Please keep it in a single line. (e.g. High Street 1, London LK1 234, UK)
* **Registered Legal Entity:** Name of your registered legal entity, if available. (e.g. Duo Ltd.)

### Team's experience
Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting code commits made by team members in past projects. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful. 

If anyone on your team has applied for a grant at the Web3 Foundation previously, please list the name of the project and legal entity here.

## Development Status :open_book: 

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Required workload of a full-time employee for the whole project (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding _needs to be below $30k for initial grants_ and $100k for follow-up grants. (e.g. 12,000 USD)

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 8,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. | 
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will publish an article/tutorial/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |


### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 4,000 USD
