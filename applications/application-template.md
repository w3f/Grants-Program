## Project Overview

**AIXS Token** is a decentralized protocol for hosting and monetizing AI models across a multi-vendor ecosystem. It enables secure, tokenized access to AI services, allowing developers, researchers, and enterprises to deploy, share, and monetize models using a unified token standard.

Built on **Substrate**, AIXS Token will integrate with Polkadot parachains to support cross-chain interoperability, privacy-preserving inferencing, and confidential model execution using **Trusted Execution Environments (TEE)**.

## Deliverables

### Milestone 1 – Core Token Infrastructure (Month 1–3)
- Substrate-based AIXS token module
- Token minting, burning, and staking logic
- GitHub repository with documentation and tests
- Integration with Polkadot JS wallet

### Milestone 2 – AI Model Registry & Access Control (Month 4–6)
- Smart contract-based AI model registry
- Role-based access control for model usage
- Token-gated API endpoints for model inferencing
- Frontend dashboard for model onboarding

### Milestone 3 – Confidential AI Execution (Month 7–12)
- Integration with TEE (Intel SGX / AMD SEV)
- Confidential inferencing pipeline
- Encrypted model hosting and execution
- Audit logs and usage analytics

### Milestone 4 – Cross-Chain Interoperability (Month 13–18)
- XCM integration for token and model portability
- Bridges to Ethereum and other AI ecosystems
- Final security audit and deployment

## Future Plans

- Launch AIXS Token on Polkadot parachain
- Expand to support AI model marketplaces
- Enable dynamic pricing and token streaming (via Superfluid/Sablier)
- Collaborate with AI vendors and research institutions

## Team Background

**Honeypotz GmbH** is building a portfolio of AI-native SaaS platforms, including:
- SAAS AI Factory – Multi-tenant AI SaaS launcher
- QUANTUMSAFE BIOEDGE – Quantum-resilient AI for healthcare
- My AI Tutor – AI-powered education platform
