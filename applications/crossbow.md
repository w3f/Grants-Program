# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Code Name:** Crossbow (formerly `Creator`)
- **Team Name:** DodoRare, Inc.
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

In the previous grant, we built a tool that can automate building rust game projects for Android and iOS and tested it on applications with base elements such as 2D image / 3D model rendering, music, touch events, networking (substrate communication), etc. Also, we made it engine agnostic, and the process itself of creating similar apps pretty straightforward. But there are plenty of things left to do to provide full support of features for more advanced games: like notifications, permissions, in-app purchases, better sounds and music support, Google Play/Apple ID authentication, AdMob, iOS Bitcode, Android Application Bundles, or AAB, etc. Most of these problems are not easy to solve, and many projects facing them are moving to more popular engines because you never know how much time it will take to add IAP or authentication to your project in pure rust. So our intention on this grant is to continue fixing and adding the most crucial components of games so that the whole rust community can use them in any rust project without any problems.

### Overview

Crossbow - Cross-Platform Rust Toolkit for Games.

A goal of the `crossbow` project is to provide a complete infrastructure for game development in rust. In addition, the project simplifies the creation and packaging of crates for Android, iOS, and other platforms. Finally, we want to make most of our tools - engine agnostic to help rust game developers integrate them into their games, engines, and crates.

Plenty of Polkadot / Kusama / Substrate game projects want to develop their games in pure rust game engines, but as there's no well-tested and reliable software - they choose standard game engines. It's terrible for the Substrate ecosystem in several ways: 1. they could enhance the rust ecosystem; 2. generate more rust jobs that will potentially start own Polkadot projects in the future or contribute to the ecosystem itself; 3. miss an opportunity to integrate full or light Substrate node directly in-game for peer2peer synchronization and a lot of other exciting stuff.

Of course, there are already a bunch of promising game engine projects, but they almost all don't provide at least adequate support to simple tools like mobile permissions, game SDK, auth, achievements, etc. That's why we want to create a single game toolkit for the most popular platforms.
