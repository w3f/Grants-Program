## Project Overview ðŸ“„

This is a response for the [Analytics Website/Data Platform](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/analysis-website-and-data-platform.md) RFP.

### Overview

Crypto data is growing rapidly, and large data companies are not  consider integrating them into their systems.   However, multi-chain crypto data is of significant value to users. The hyperdot is a on-chain data platform for querying, analyzing, and creations, written in Rust. It provides users with powerful capabilities for data querying, analysis, and creations.

With hyperdot, users can easily query and analyze crypto data from **Polkadot**, **Kusama**, and other **parallel chains built on the Substrate Runtime**. Hyperdot separates the indexing and computation of on-chain crypto data from the off-chain data storage, analysis, and querying, addressing scalability issues present in many data analysis platforms. Hyperdot offers multiple data engines to adapt to different scenarios.

Hyperdot provides a dashboard similar to [Dune Analytics](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards) and [Chainbase](https://chainbase.com/), offering powerful data analysis and visualization features currently.   Users can create queries using different data engines and generate visual data dashboards.   Importantly, Hyperdot is dedicated to building a data analysis creations community where data engineers and data scientists can create and share their work based on Hyperdot's data, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange.


### Project Details


#### The System Overview

The Hyperdot project consists of two main system: hyperdot-node and hyperdot-frontend-end.

hyperdot-Node will ideally integrate the data source of [substrate-etl](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/substrate-etl) to provide an crypto-data query api on the chain

hyperdot-frontend-end is built using [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) and [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), creating a modern web dashboard. While it works similar to Dune Analytics, it has its own unique features. Hyperdot-Frontend connects to Hyperdot-Node to provide users with user-friendly chain data analysis capabilities. Moreover, it aims to establish a data analysis community where data engineers and data scientists can create and share insights based on the data provided by Hyperdot.

#### The System Architecutre

Hyperdot will consider the success of the existing work of the integration community, for example, on the data source, we will choose to integrate [substrate-etl](https://github.com/colorfulnotion/substrate-etl) as the data of hyperdot-node-front engine, at the same time, in order to maintain good scalability, hyperdot-node will also retain other options.


![Hyperdot System Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infra3-Network/hyperdot/dev/docs/imgs/hyperdot-arch2.drawio.png)

The system is mainly divided into three parts
1. substrate-etl provides the relevant data warehouse, other ecosystems allow us to customize the index, and we will integrate their data as the data source of the system on demand
2. hyperdot-Node will integrate data from common bins provided by substrate etl and provide apis for hyperdot-front-end
3. hyperdot-fronted-end provides a user-friendly front-end interface for data analysis, exploration, and collaborative data analysis creation. It is built using modern front-end technologies. The interaction between hyperdot-fronted-end and hyperdot primarily utilizes HTTP, while GraphQL is used for handling complex data queries. WebSockets are employed for subscription-based data updates.

#### The Live Demo

We have deployed a small [live demo](https://playground.infra-3.xyz/) that you can play directly with.

### Ecosystem Fit

hyperdot will integrate data from Polkadot, Kusama, and Substrate networks by utilizing the infrastructure of substrate, substrate-etl, and other Parity technology communities. It will support multi-chain and multi-runtime environments. hyperdot will provide a dashboard that enables users to easily query on-chain crypto data using SQL language. Additionally, it will establish a community for data querying, analysis, creation, and sharing, allowing users to exchange insights.

hyperdot is a data querying, analysis, creation, and sharing platform targeting a wide range of users, including data analysts, data scientists, project managers, and anyone interested in analyzing on-chain crypto data using hyperdot.

Currently, we have not found similar projects in the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystems. Moreover, data analysis systems that support multi-chain, multi-data engine integration with good scalability are rare in other ecosystems as well. We firmly believe that hyperdot will bring significant value to the community.



### QA

**Q:** Come up with a value proposition to make it viable: "how would the project stay sustainable and capture value?" to sustain operating costs 

**A:** 

- **Sustainability:** First, technically, we have a team with a good web3 background, so we don't get stuck with technical issues. Second, we were able to reduce our storage costs by relying on other projects' data warehouses, which allowed our projects to grow healthier.

- **Capture value:** We believe that the ecosystem needs a "dune for substrate, but better" project that enables more powerful analytics for all users.

**Q:** Interview a few parachains/ecosystem teams & researchers on the top 3 "dashboards" or interactive data use cases they'd like to see and include how you would solve that as part of the analysis and data platform RFP.

**A:** We can't give a precise answer to this question, but we did a deep dive last week into existing data analytics projects in the ecosystem and, similarly, they always present data that users expect on top3. hyperdot is a little different,

1. hyperdot allows anyone to create analytics dashboards using data provided by the substrate-etl repository, so the top3 ranking is not actually controlled by hyperdot
2. However, we provide a favorites ranking for each dashboard, which can accurately show which data analytics dashboards are widely used by the community based on favorites

## Development Status ðŸ“–

In 2022, Ryan started exploring Substrate and The Graph, and at that time, he attempted to add support for Substrate data on The Graph for private chains. This effort lasted for approximately six months. 

Starting from March of this year, Ryan and Ming were inspired by Dune and Chainbase, and they thoroughly studied the architecture design and implementation of these projects. Subsequently, we discussed the feasibility of building a multi-chain, multi-runtime, multi-data engine, scalable platform for web3 data analysis, creation, and a community of web3 data enthusiasts. 

We began designing and implementing Hyperdot, with Tania providing us with a simple data playground. Currently, we have achieved an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) validation of the core components, and they are functioning well. It is estimated that it will take another three months to make them work properly. Therefore, now is the time to apply for a W3F grant and introduce the work we have done to the entire Substrate community.

## Future Plans

After completing hyperdot and releasing the first  version, we will integrate more data engines, including time series data engines (influxdb), OLAP analytics engines (Clickhouse), and distributed query engines (Spark).

We will consider indexing more types of data, not just raw chain data, but also decoded dex and not data, as well as additional extrinsic data. Additionally, we plan to establish a mechanism where developers can propose data models they want to index through GitHub or the community. Once adopted, these data models will be incorporated into our data engines.

We will also consider **integrating ChatGPT to provide natural language querying capabilities (we are think it's something that's going to get the whole community excited about)**. Specifically, users will no longer need to be proficient in SQL and can run queries using natural language prompts.

We will introduce a P2P structure for storage nodes to make them decentralized. We also plan to optimize and upgrade the UI based on user feedback, such as adding more dashboards and improving the data creation process. Additionally, we will explore integrating Grafana for better data visualization dashboards.

Lastly, we expect to collaborate with foundations to promote our platform and showcase its value to more users. We will also engage with the community through platforms such as Twitter, YouTube, Medium, and others to introduce hyperdot.
