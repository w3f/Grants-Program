# Archive – Decentralized Publishing on Polkadot

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** Archive  
**Team Name:** Archive Core  
**Members:** Vladimir Prodous (Founder), Elina (CTO)  
**GitHub:** githabium 
**Website:** (https://why-not-beta.vercel.app/)

**Short Summary:**  
Archive is a decentralized self-publishing protocol that enables authors to create, encrypt, and distribute their works directly without intermediaries. Every work begins as an **NLP (Non-Liquid Paper)** — a blank, tokenized canvas that evolves into an **NFB (Not Fading Book)** or a permanent **Artifact** based on author and community interactions.  

Archive aims to launch **natively on Polkadot**, leveraging **Substrate** for modular runtime development, decentralized governance, and cross-chain asset interoperability.  
Our architecture is designed to showcase Polkadot as a home for creative and cultural dApps — merging digital literature, blockchain authorship, and decentralized ownership.

## Project Details

### Key Deliverables
- **NFB Publisher Module (Substrate Pallet):**  
  A Substrate-based publishing module that allows writers to mint NFBs on-chain, linking authorship, content hashes, and reader engagement metrics.

- **Condinus Encryption Layer:**  
  Open-source encryption mechanism that translates every NFB into a multi-language cryptographic format, ensuring immutability and originality.

- **Litrium Token Integration:**  
  Native Polkadot asset for rewarding creators and readers — non-purchasable, earned through participation and creative output.

- **Artifact Path Governance:**  
  Polkadot’s on-chain governance enables readers and authors to influence NFB evolution transparently via voting.

- **Archive Runtime Bridge:**  
  Enables cross-chain interaction between literary NFTs and other Polkadot parachains (e.g., Astar, Phala, Moonbeam).

## Why Polkadot

- Archive demonstrates **non-financial blockchain utility**, expanding Polkadot’s ecosystem into the global creative economy (~$1.7B self-publishing market).  
- Substrate’s modularity allows us to build **a specialized runtime for publishing logic** — including tokenized reputation, engagement weighting, and governance over literary Artifacts.  
- Using **Polkadot parachain integration**, Archive can scale decentralized distribution across networks, maintaining high throughput and low fees.  
- This project helps **diversify Polkadot’s ecosystem** with a real-world, cultural use case — empowering digital ownership beyond DeFi.

## Additional Information

- Archive will open-source all code under **MIT License**.  
- Long-term goal: **become a Polkadot parachain** focused on decentralized intellectual property and creative economy.  
- All milestones will be verifiable through public repositories and Substrate test deployments.

## Conclusion

Archive is where authorship meets blockchain.  
Launching on Polkadot allows the project to demonstrate that creative and cultural ecosystems can exist fully on-chain — decentralized, transparent, and censorship-resistant.  
By bridging literature with technology, Archive extends Polkadot’s influence into the global publishing industry, proving that code can carry imagination as much as it carries finance.
