## Project Overview
Onboarding the next billion users to Blockchain. Are you going to ask them to use a desktop browser extension ? Most people dont have a desktop - especially in Asia. Their only device of accessing the internet is their mobile phone. That's why you need a web browser build ground up for crypto (and which implements all of the browser specific EIP). The user does not need a wallet app and a browser app separately.

Wootzapp is the way that a hundred million NEW users will use the w3f chain for the *First Time*. In fact, by making their first account on w3f, we will lead the default chain experience to be w3f first. We want people to mint their first w3f asset/NFT within 30 seconds of signing up for Wootzapp. It stands to reason, since w3f manages assets like images and media and the number reason people do anything on the web is media.

we are a fully opensource (https://github.com/wootzapp/wootz-browser) mobile browser that is built for crypto. The wallet and everything else is integrated in. We have also implemented several EIP that were specific to browser integration and were waiting for Chrome to implement in.
for a new user to crypto - especially the billions of users in Asia who do NOT have a desktop computer or browser extensions - the way to use crypto is simply "use this browser, it has everything built in". 
If you visit a dapp website, our custom javascript-native bridge will popup and all the web3 functions will work automatically.
 
The goal of this proposal is to create a new web browser for the next billion users to interact with Web3 services such as IPFS, w3f, etc. You can think of this like Google Chrome built purposely to the needs of first time crypto users (and with better integration for Web3 services).
Our goal is to give the easiest possible onramp experience for the mainstream user (who is not crypto savvy) and then progressively draw him deeper over time into ZK rollups, Account Abstraction, etc.
 
We are razor focused on dropping cost of acquisition for blockchain at large. By solving for on-ramp. Our whole goal is to bring the next 100 million users to crypto. Our GTM is to act as the heldesk for crypto/NFT projects who encounter "how should I use a wallet" or "how do I mint this NFT". WootzApp will act as the helpdesk for these users on social media. 
Our revenue model is well understand - similar to Firefox. we will have partnerships with default search engines, swap platforms and exchanges.

We are looking to be the ultimate consumers of the web3 Graph. We are changing the paradigm of what a browser means in the web3 world. We want the user  to traverse the web3 graph...just as easily as they traverse the web2 web today. How do you surface like transaction graph, liquidity movement, tracking wallets, liquidity, etc in a browser. That is the need of the moment..even more so after the market instability. People realise that they need more information (not less) and WootzApp+Web graph can be the answer.

### Project Details

-   **Name:** WootzApp
-   **Brief Description:** Create a new, free, open-source mobile-first web browser with an integrated wallet. Especially for the next billion users.
-   **Relationship to w3fIO:** w3fIO will become massively more usable on the mobile phone web using Wootzapp
-   **Reason for Interest:** WootzApp devs has been focusing on the evolution of w3fIO especially due to their core focus on wallets/DAO onboarding. w3fIO team has not only innovated at the protocol level, but done the painstaking work to build multiple SDKs on multiple different programming languages. Our philosophy towards onramp aligns with w3fIO.

### Project Details
 

-   **A. WootzApp Core Mobile Web Browser Source Code:** https://github.com/wootzapp/wootz-browser.
-   **B. WootzApp Android app release:** [https://github.com/wootzapp/wootz-browser.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wootzapp.browser)
-   **C. WootzApp Design Assets:** [Figma assets](https://www.figma.com/file/ZiV1e5dTxNU20so3foISK7/wootzapp). We are fundamentally innovating on how a user comes on board for the first time to web3. We want w3fIO to be one of the first blockchains that a user ever touches for the first time in their life. And we are mobile-first. This requires a completely new way to think about design and we are innovating here. here are more screens on a radical rethink of browsers - https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1598380478029266944 and https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1599108929711378432


### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**

This project fits under wallet & infrastructure ecosystem for end users to use.

 **What are the benefits of getting this right?**
 
 We believe that a web3 browser built ground up can open up the addressable market for crypto. In a time for market volatility, it is a matter of great urgency to expand the market outside the few million crypto early adopters and influencers.
 For example, even in the US, crypto adoption is restricted to the major cities like NY,LA, SF. However if you go to the midwest, where there is abysmally low credit card penetration..it is surprising that there is no crypto adoption. This is trillions of dollars left on the table for the overall crypto world.
 The best case scenario is that our browser kickstarts a next generation of dapps built purposefully for the mainstream user.

 One of the big questions that arise around crypto powered payments is - Integration. How do you integrate with the millions of payment systems, gateways out there ? The "acceptance" problem is something most crypto projects smooth over. But it is critical to Payments success. The answer comes from Google and Apple. Chrome and Safari are built entirely around Google Pay or Apple Pay. In fact, they have very deep integration with Visa/Mastercard to automatically generate a credit card number on-the-fly during a checkout transaction.
 Why ? Because you no longer need to integrate with anyone. By deeply integrating a payment instrument within the browser, Google/Apple have Trojan horsed their way into universal payments.
 We can do the same - with WootzApp. For web3 and Crypto. 
 
 **What are the risks if you don't get it right?**
 
Hindi is spoken by 300 million users across India, Pakistan, Nepal and Bangladesh. There is no word for "virtual" in Hindi. BIP-39 mnemonic also has no equivalent in Hindi.
In our experience, crypto onramp is in its infancy and the design+language of crypto needs to evolve to serve the needs of all.
Failing to get this right could put off the mainstream user for a long long time. And it is the mainstream user that has the voting power to change regulations.


 **What are the risks that will make executing this project difficult?**
 
 Distribution and retention.

 Distribution: Distributing a new browser is known to be a tough problem. We hope to mitigate this by acting as the heldesk for crypto/NFT projects who encounter "how should I use a wallet" or "how do I mint this NFT". WootzApp will act as the helpdesk for these users on social media. 
 
Retention: Design and Langage is key to keep the user from getting frustrated with the developer experience. We have found great value in design workshops with this demographic. For example these are our design studies for what a new tab looks like in https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1599108929711378432 and https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1598380478029266944
We propose to have 4 designers do indepth interviews in 4 different countries - India, Brazil (esp the favela neighborhood), Nigeria and Greece. We will choose non-major cities and these designers will spend 1 month iterating on design in their communities. we are estimating a rough cost of 2000$ per month for each designer and some incidentals.
This is the highest value deliverable that comes out of this project. We commit to release this study publicly to have them in the public domain for the ecosystem to utilise.

**Who is your target audience?**

End users. First time crypto users.

**What need(s) does your project meet?**

for a new user to crypto - especially the billions of users in Asia who do NOT have a desktop computer or browser extensions - the way to use crypto is simply "use this browser, it has everything built in". 

**Are there any other projects similar to yours in the w3fIO ecosystem?**

none

**If so, how is your project different?**

NA.

## Development Roadmap
### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:**
  - 3 months for MS1 (in parallel)
  - 1.5 months for MS2 (consecutive)
  - 1.5 months for MS3 (consecutive)
  - 3 months for MS4 (in parallel)
  - Total of 6 months work volume
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**
  - Average of 1 FTE
  - The team currently has other main jobs or engagements and can consequently invest only limited amounts of time - we will do our best to invest as much time as possible to progress as fast as possible. The team is prepared and looking forward to switching to the project full-time in the future.
- **Total Costs:** 15,000 USD
-   **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months


### Milestone 1 - Initial w3f integration
- **Estimated duration:** 1.5 month
- **FTE:** 0.5
- **Costs:** 4500~5000 USD
  - Annual salary for calculation 72,000 USD
  - (72,000 / 12 \* 1.5 months) \* 0.5 FTE 

This involves w3f integration into the mobile app, testing on both platforms (ios + android) and release to live. We want to have users an experience where they can do their first token/NFT purchase for the first time in their lives on WootzApp and w3f. 

### Milestone 2 - Phishing and Security enhancements for the mobile app
- **Estimated duration:** 1.5 month
- **FTE:** 0.5
- **Costs:** 7000~9000 USD
  - Annual salary for calculation 72,000 USD
  - (72,000 / 12 \* 3 months) \* 0.5 FTE 

This includes features like transaction simulation, whitelisted dapp/contracts and other phishing related to the w3f ecosystem. We would appreciate help from the core dev team during this phase so that we can cut short the time to identify common vectors of attack.


### Milestone 3 - Security Audit of our Flutter Codebase 
- **Estimated duration:** 3 month (in parallel)
- **Costs:** External vendor. Approximate costs 6000~10,000 USD

Done by external agency. most auditors are familiar with Solidity. Flutter and mobile codebases need a special audit.

### Milestone 4 - Integration with KYC and onramp vendors + Fiat ramps to w3f
- **Estimated duration:** 3 month
- **FTE:** 0.5
- **Costs:** 4500~5000 USD
  - Annual salary for calculation 72,000 USD
  - (72,000 / 12 \* 1.5 months) \* 0.5 FTE 

Being able to buy w3f in a single click of the button with credit card, etc. I have worked for a long time in payments space. this will take the longest because of the need for specific compliances/approvals, etc. This is critical for w3f, since the protocol hinges on being able to incentivize file processing. Anything that makes this super easy from the end user side is super critical and is missing from w3f right now. The effort is not 3 man months. it just has a latency to it.

### Milestone 5 -  Design study for new markets
- **Estimated duration:** 3 month
- **FTE:** 1
- **Costs:** 10-12k USD

Our primary goal is to be the wallet for the next billion users. We figured out that it can only happen if you kill the concept of a wallet. And become a browser.
We have found great value in design workshops with this demographic. For example these are our design studies for what a new tab looks like in https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1599108929711378432 and https://twitter.com/WootzApp/status/1598380478029266944
We propose to have 4 designers do indepth interviews in 4 different countries - India, Brazil (esp the favela neighborhood), Nigeria and Greece. We will choose non-major cities and these designers will spend 1 month iterating on design in their communities. we are estimating a rough cost of 2000$ per month for each designer and some incidentals.
This is the highest value deliverable that comes out of this project. We commit to release this study publicly to have them in the public domain for the ecosystem to utilise.
The value to w3f is this - we want w3f to be the first/default blockchain for these users. And most of them know only about "Bitcoin" if anything. How do you explain the value of investing in w3f to this demographic? This is a low cost cost-of-acquisition line item for w3f. I would imagine the result of this study to be utilised in your own marketing materials, for example.
 

 Beyond the above, these are the other parts of our roadmap
- Legal & Regulatory Setup
- Integration with maximum Public  Testnet
- Security Audits by Certik and other firms
- Kick-off DAO for browser governance
- Bug Bounty Program
- Grant Program


## Future Plans

Our vision is to create a Google Chrome or Safari with integrated Apple Pay for the crypto world.
Payments and Checkout is a core usecase that can only be enabled with the browser. Moreover as the European Union forces Apple to open the App Store, (https://decrypt.co/117172/apple-external-ios-apps-crypto-nfts), we think it will be a pivotal moment to open up web3 for the world. We have been working for more than a year on this and are best suited to create something good. Moreover, unlike a lot of wallets...WootzApp has been opensource from day 1.  
The risk of not doing this is for all crypto (including w3f) ending up in the same situation as the Coinbase Wallet. https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2022/12/01/apples-new-coinbase-shakedown-would-literally-ban-ethereum-trades-and-transfers-on-ios/?sh=382059df3bb5

This is not a proposal promising a dream. This is a real, live, functioning early stage browser created from a long term vision of more than a year. And now looking at the timing+ecosystem falling into place. Our funds ask is for acceleration and not prototype.
