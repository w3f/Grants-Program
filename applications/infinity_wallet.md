### Overview

![Infinity Wallet - The one-stop Wallet, DeFi and Web3 solution|690x356](https://i.gyazo.com/08988c63d9098ebd0c270d2b20c662f4.png)

**One sentence summary:**  A unique all-in-one wallet ecosystem providing a one-stop solution for all a user's payment, DeFi, NFT and crypto needs, with the first standalone Web3 browser for seamless access to Web3.

#### Description
Infinity Wallet is the first all-in-one non-custodial wallet ecosystem and Web3 browser of its kind on desktop (“a Wallet Super App”). Not a browser extension, but a complete standalone desktop application providing a one-stop solution for seamless access and usability of DeFi, NFTs and cross-border payments, with a gateway to the world of Web3/DApps via the first desktop Web3 browser and Dapp store. Fulfilling all a user's decentralized needs in a single platform, while removing the complexities of decentralized finance and Web3, enabling economic freedom for everyone globally!

Infinity Wallet was created to finally enable mass adoption, as a single access point to the entire decentralized world. We have focused on providing the best possible user experience, to lower the barrier to entry and allow for streamlined and secure adoption of DeFi and Web3. Providing a world-class user experience with a seamless user interface, and a full spectrum of constantly growing in-wallet features and services as a one-stop hub. Making Infinity Wallet the complete solution for all crypto users’ needs, while making adoption and usage of cross-border payments, DeFi, NFTs and Web3 easier than ever before for mainstream adoption.

Infinity Wallet is not just a unique one-stop wallet built for the masses, but it is also the first desktop platform to provide users with access to the entire Web3 and DApp space without needing to leave their wallet, with the first Web3 browser and DApp store on desktop as a standalone App. Finally removing the need to use unintuitive, unfriendly and feature-lacking browser extension wallets ever again! Providing a far superior, safer and more natural user experience, with a range of unique advantages for users, DApps, and chains alike, while enabling easier usage and adoption.


### Project Details

### Ecosystem Fit
Wallets are one of the most fundamental components required for usage and adoption of DeFi, Web3, crypto payments, a chain and its ecosystem, however they are one of the least well developed applications in the crypto ecosystem.

Today, wallets act mainly as an interface, serving primarily as a transaction signing layer, with very limited functionality or in-wallet features, requiring use of multiple platforms, and are generally lacking in basic UX, while providing very unprofessional, hard to use and aesthetically poor user interfaces, with most platforms built for developers rather than end users. This has been sufficient for the early adopters in crypto, however, for the next billion users to onboard, a more curated, frictionless and high quality user experience is required!

Desktop Web3 wallet options are limited in particular, delivering very little in terms of new innovation, or solving today’s issues, while requiring the user to install a browser extension, which is not the natural flow. Overall delivering an unintuitive and feature-lacking user experience, with limited support for a chain and its ecosystem/DApps, greatly restricting the possibility for discoverability and adoption.

For Polkadot to compete and attract users and developers, it needs a one-stop wallet super app providing a seamless user experience, to enable users to onboard and adopt Polkadot, and discover the Polkadot ecosystem as their home.

As of today the Polkadot & Kusama ecosystem have very few wallet solutions and no wallet one-stop super app! The wallet solutions that do exist today are not built for mass adoption or use by less tech savvy users, they are more built with a focus on usage by developers and generally provide low quality user interfaces, lack a curated in-wallet experience, lack many features/services that users require and overall provide a terrible UX.

On desktop, wallet solutions that exist today are browser extension wallets (generally clones of each other) requiring the users to install an extension to transact with a chain or interact with DApps. This is not a natural user experience, which Infinity Wallet solves by providing a one-stop app and standalone web3 browser with DApp store, removing the need for browser extensions and providing a more natural and enhanced experience for users.

#### Target Audience
Our target audience would primarily be retail users (for wallet, instant cross-border payments, accessing DeFi, NFTs and Web3/DApps), along with a secondary focus on developers with adoption and awareness (for DApps, Tokens and NFTs).

#### Infinity Wallet Advantages
Infinity Wallet provides a unique all-in-one wallet solution and the first Web3 browser on desktop, with a mobile version also in the works that will redefine the Crypto, DeFi & Web3 experience on mobile. Bringing a wide range of advantages, such as:

* A unique platform in the space providing a complete experience in a standalone desktop app, rather than a browser extension. Delivering a high quality, one-stop user focused experience required for mass adoption;

* The first desktop Web3 browser & DApp store. Finally freeing desktop users from having to use unintuitive and feature-lacking browser extension wallets to access Web3 and DApps. While providing a simpler, easy to use medium to access Web3 and discover DApps;

* Infinity Wallet enables users to directly connect to a DApp on the web, but also to connect with DApps that require connecting via their own downloadable software/app rather than a domain. Making Infinity Wallet the only desktop wallet to support true unlimited access to all of Web3.

* An encompassing approach to provide an all-in-one multi-chain platform, supporting all chain types (EVM and non-EVM) across the Infinity ecosystem. Enabling seamless use of all chains within a single platform, for easier interoperability between chains and removing the need for multiple wallets.

* We are delivering a more curated in-wallet experience, with a focus on providing a far superior and seamless user experience, as a one-stop solution for all a user’s DeFi, Web3, NFT, Crypto and Payment needs. With all features, services and protocols directly accessible within a single platform, and working with users on constant new developments to meet their demands;

* We are actively solving issues within the space today. Such as, the need to learn and use multiple platforms, lack of live user DeFi & Web3 support to help users learn and onboard, lack of new innovation and limited features/services (limiting the user experience, along with user accessibility/usage), high fees, bad user experience and unprofessional user interfaces. With most other platforms built with a focus more on developers rather than less technical end users;

* Our team has been within the crypto/blockchain space for close to 10 years. Having gained a vast amount of experience with the industry, and a deep understanding of what is missing and needed to onboard the next 1 billion users to DeFi & Web3.

#### Usage of funds
The grant would be utilized to help fund the developments outlined for building out Polkadot & Kusama with complete integration into the Infinity Wallet and Web3 Browser, its features and required infrastructure that will be developed. As we operate as a free to use platform for hundreds of thousands of users and are self funded, we require a grant to help cover the development costs. While this would provide Polkadot & Kusama with a much needed valuable platform that is solving many issues in the crypto, Web3 and payments spaces.


## Future Plans
Our long term plan is to continue to refine and deliver innovative solutions with the Infinity Wallet. Working closely with users to further establish Infinity Wallet as a leading wallet and DeFi ecosystem with Web3 browser, serving hundreds of millions of users on Desktop and Mobile.


We have a lot planned over the next couple of years, however some of the developments planned over the next 6 months that could benefit Polkadot in the future as we release them on a case by case basis include:


* One-click in-wallet fiat on/off ramp;
* UX focused Mobile Wallet release (redefining the entire DeFi & Web3 experience, from UI, UX and features);
* Direct in-wallet Staking;
* Social Wallet (removing the need for a seed phrase and enabling users to create a wallet via social login, allowing for easier onboarding and usage of DeFi & Web3 by the general Web2 user required for mass adoption);


More on our overall roadmap that could benefit Polkadot can be found on page 27, here: https://infinitywallet.io/docs/Infinity%20Wallet%20Deck.pdf OR our docs here https://docs.infinitywallet.io/infinity-wallet/infinity-ecosystem-roadmap

Specific to Polkadot & Kusama, we will continue to provide ongoing support and integration into future developments/features/services on a case by case basis, as well as support in our unique user focused mobile version once launched.
