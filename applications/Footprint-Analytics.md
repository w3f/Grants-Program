## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Footprint Analytics is a data platform blending web2 and web3 data with abstractions. We help analysts, builders, and investors turn blockchain data into insights with accessible visualization tools and a powerful multi-chain API across 20+ chains for NFTs, GameFi, and DeFi.
- We would love to parse Polkadot and Kusama chain data. We can provide developers with easy access to reliable, structured data. This empowers developers to build innovative applications, smart contracts, and decentralized protocols on top of Polkadot and Kusama, accelerating the growth and adoption of the ecosystem.
- Polkadot and Kusama are part of the blockchain ecosystem and provide facilitate interoperability among different blockchains. They foster a vibrant and rapidly evolving ecosystem. Parsing Polkadot and Kusama data enables the community to gain valuable insights into network usage, transaction patterns, developer activity, and the overall health of the ecosystem. This information is invaluable for developers, researchers, and businesses seeking to understand the trends and opportunities within the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - We are building a Web3 data infrastructure for developers, analysts, researchers, and more.
  - Blockchain is a new technology, and we are still exploring its value. Unfortunately, most analytics tools focus on cryptocurrency quotes and compliance analysis, but Footprint is changing that. Footprint Analytics is a one-stop analytics platform that makes blockchain analytics possible for anyone. Here are some of its features:
    - **Most comprehensive coverage of Chains and Domains.** Now Footprint Analytics has the most comprehensive warehouse of indexed on-chain data, covering 20+ chains, 18 NFT marketplaces, over 2000 GameFi projects, and over 1,000,000 NFT collections.
    - **Diverse and robust data model.** Footprint has developed our own data model, which involves aggregating raw data in accordance with various triggers (scheduled, directly after the raw transaction data is saved, etc.) into tables that immediately carry business value by design. 
    - **Build your customized Web3 infrastructure with Footprint Analytics Data APIs.** Now, Footprint Analytics puts all data at the world's fingertips with a unified data API. It allows developers to access data with a single query. The flexible API with SQL and REST versions is an enterprise-grade Web3 tool that connects any tech stack to blockchain networks.
    - **The first blockchain data analytics supports support web2 data connectors to understand users across the webs**
  - With Footprint, anyone can collect, summarize, and visualize data from the blockchain, making it easier to process and understand blockchain data. It's time to explore the actual value of blockchain analytics with Footprint Analytics.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - Mainly for developers and web3 participants who need data support
- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - Cross-chain data analytics and development, connecting on-chain and off-chain data.  
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - Footprint Analytics is a data infra suitable for all ecosystems. Here is a comparison between Footprint and our competitors.
  - Footprint Analytics highlights:
    - Developers can solve their team's data needs for FREE at Footprint: product development, project operation, marketing, and other scenarios, and all data can be reused between teams.
    - Developers can not only use the raw data, but also directly use structured and semantic data, and even connect the on-chain and off-chain data for analysis.

### Team's experience

We have a strong team. I am in my 11th year of working together. In these 10+ years, our team has made e-commerce applications with 10 million users, and fintech applications including trading/risk management/credit models.
Most of these projects, which made it to the top of the industry, could not continue to scale up due to some industry policies. Interestingly, even after changing many different projects, our core team has been able to keep learning and keep moving forward together.
In 17 years, our team started to contact blockchain and was one of the early miners. 18~19 years we tried to apply our experience in quantitative trading to blockchain and did some quantitative trading in CeFi for a while, and in 20 years I led the team to develop a few Dapps. So our team has been following the blockchain track and trying some projects. In 21 years, the team went through a few intense after some heated discussions, we decided to find a track that was worth investing in for 10 years. Since our team had rich project experience in web2 data and models as well as web3 in the previous years, we made a combination of these experiences in web2 and web3 and started from the web3 data track, which was the origin of Footprint.

## Future Plans

**Go to market strategy:**
We focus on a combination of Inbound and Outbound marketing strategy.
- Inbound: 
  - This is a relatively strong segment for the Footprint team, which has gained its current market influence with zero marketing spend. Footprint traffic is 70% organic, thanks to our content and research output. We have partnered with a number of research reports, such as Coinmarketcap coingecko.
  - We have also established cooperation with many media channels, such as Cryptoslate, Coinrivet, etc., and our content has been reproduced many times by other media outlets, such as Yahoo Finance.
- Outbound: Starting in Q3 2022, we formed a sales team to reach out to developers and customers from online and offline, in multiple countries to improve our sales performance.
- BD cooperation: Work on BD cooperation with public chains, research institutions, communities, and other organizations, and participate in major industry conferences, Hackathons, etc., to increase exposure and influence.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

I heard about the grants program in several ways: on Web3 Foundation Website / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation  / Blockchain news.

Currently, we have parsed a total of 20+ chains, providing 0 code usage data to get insights for all those in the Web3 industry, as well as a free-to-use API.

And we got several grants from other chains before, for example, Sui, Optimism, Cronos, Near, Combo, etc.
