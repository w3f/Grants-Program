## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
Ortege - Bridging Worlds, Enabling Possibilities 

Ortege represents a groundbreaking cross-chain protocol designed to facilitate the seamless transfer of value and information across diverse blockchain networks. 

Our mission with Ortege is to address the pressing issue of blockchain interoperability, specifically by fostering compatibility between ink! based chains and those built on Solidity, Cosmos, and Solana. This innovative solution will empower different blockchain networks to interact and exchange value, thereby unlocking unprecedented opportunities in the realms of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), and a myriad of other blockchain applications. 

By bridging these disparate blockchain ecosystems, Ortege aims to enhance liquidity, improve accessibility, and boost efficiency for users, regardless of their chosen blockchain platform. 

We are seeking to construct this as a crucial part of the burgeoning ink! infrastructure. Our vision is to provide an indispensable foundation that will support and accelerate the growth and adoption of the ink! ecosystem, fostering a more interconnected and efficient blockchain landscape 

### Ink! Ecosystem Impact 

By constructing robust infrastructure, we aim to unlock a plethora of use cases that are currently unattainable. A prime example is the integration of Chainlink Oracle data feeds, a highly sought-after feature within new ecosystems. However, the prohibitive costs and extensive launch times often act as deterrents. With Ortege, we intend to revolutionize this process. Any ink! chain will be able to remotely access Chainlink price feeds, reaping the benefits of Chainlink without incurring exorbitant costs. 

Furthermore, Ortege will facilitate the bridging of both fungible and non-fungible tokens across all supported chains, thereby enhancing the fluidity of asset transfer and interaction. 

One of the unique features of Ortege is its ability to allow users to manage interchain accounts from ink! based chains. This means that users can maintain their presence within the ink! ecosystem while remotely controlling accounts on other chains, thereby offering a seamless and integrated user experience. 

Our approach to building Ortege involves leveraging our existing smart contracts, originally developed for Solidity, and implementing them within the ink! framework. This strategy not only capitalizes on our established resources but also ensures a smooth transition and integration within the ink! ecosystem. 

 ### Benefiting the Kusama Ecosystem 

 The deployment of Ortege into the ink! framework is not just an advancement for ink! but also a significant leap forward for the Kusama ecosystem. Kusama, known for its pioneering spirit and its role as a canary network for Polkadot, thrives on innovation and the exploration of new frontiers in the blockchain space. 

Ortege's cross-chain protocol will further solidify Kusama's position as a hub for cutting-edge blockchain projects. By fostering compatibility between ink! based chains and other major platforms, Ortege will attract a broader range of developers and projects to the Kusama ecosystem. This influx of talent and innovation will lead to a richer tapestry of applications and solutions built on Kusama, driving its growth and prominence in the blockchain industry. 

Moreover, as Ortege enhances liquidity and accessibility across chains, it will also bolster Kusama's reputation as a network that prioritizes user experience and inclusivity. The ability to bridge assets and information across diverse networks will make Kusama an even more attractive destination for projects seeking interoperability and cross-chain functionality. 

In essence, Ortege's integration into ink! will not only elevate the ink! infrastructure but will also play a pivotal role in the expansion and evolution of the Kusama ecosystem, making it a beacon for innovation, collaboration, and growth in the decentralized world. 

### Project Details 

 For an overview of the architecture please see the following: 

https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVM4gLfNU=/?share_link_id=987322811617  

From the diagram we can break the major components into off chain agents and on chain smart contracts. The on chain smart contracts are responsible for sending and receiving messages as well as securing the delivery of the network. The off chain agents consist of validators and relayers to relay the messages between chains.  

#### Data Models / API Specifications of the Core Functionality 

The core functionality of Ortege includes several key APIs: 
  
Messaging API: This API allows for the sending and receiving of messages between chains. 

Accounts API: This API enables an account on one chain to make smart contract calls on remote chains. 

Queries API: This API allows an account on one chain to make view calls on remote chains. 

Warp Route API: This API enables the movement of native, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens across chains. 

#### Overview of the Technology Stack 

The technology stack for Ortege includes: 

Ink!: The smart contract language for building the core functionality. 

Hyperlane: The interoperability layer that allows for communication between different blockchains. 

Solidity: Will be made compatible with ink! based chains through Ortege. 

#### Documentation of Core Components, Protocols, Architecture 

The core components of Ortege will include: 

Interchain Security Modules: These modules give developers control over their security model, allowing them to configure, compose, and customize security according to the needs of their application. 

Warp Routes: These routes allow native, ERC20, and ERC721 tokens to move seamlessly across chains. 

Interchain Accounts: These accounts allow an account on one chain (e.g., a DAO) to make smart contract calls on remote chains. 

Interchain Queries: These queries allow an account on one chain to make view calls on remote chains. 

The architecture of Ortege is designed for modularity and permissionless interoperability. This architecture allows any blockchain environment, whether it is a layer 1, rollup, or app-chain, to communicate seamlessly with any other chain on which Ortege has been deployed. 

Please note that this is a high-level overview and the actual implementation may involve additional components and technologies. The exact details will depend on the specific requirements of the Ortege protocol and the constraints of the ink! language and the Ortege architecture. 

Our architecture is heavily based on Hyperlaneâ€™s and you can find detailed technical documentation here: https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/introduction/readme  

Please note the following out scope elements: 

* Smart contract audits 

* Scaper agent for indexing the chain 

* Explorer 

* Mainnet deployment: The PoC will only be deployed to the Shibuya testnet and connected to the Goerli testnet. The PoC will allow one-way communication from Goerli to Shibuya. 

This focused scope allows us to deliver an effective PoC while setting the stage for more extensive work in the future. The result of this phase will be a functional prototype that demonstrates the interchain communication of Chainlink price feeds. We are confident that the utilization of Chainlink's ISM will eliminate the need for significant adjustments to the validator agent. 

### Ecosystem Fit 

#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? 
 Our project, an ink! adaptation of Hyperlane, is designed to seamlessly integrate into the Substrate ecosystem. It serves as a high-performance cross-chain communication protocol that facilitates the rapid and secure transfer of data and value across different blockchain networks. By leveraging Substrate's modular framework, our project enhances interoperability, making it easier for various blockchains within the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems to communicate and collaborate. 

 #### Who is your target audience? 

 Our primary target audience includes parachain developers, dapp creators, and wallet/UI developers within the Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama ecosystems. Additionally, we aim to serve designers who are looking to create user-friendly interfaces for cross-chain interactions, as well as dapp user bases that require efficient cross-chain functionalities. 

 #### What need(s) does your project meet? 

 Our project addresses the critical need for efficient and secure cross-chain communication within the blockchain ecosystem. As the decentralized world grows, the ability for different blockchains to interact seamlessly becomes paramount. Our ink! version of Hyperlane ensures that data and value transfers across chains are swift, reliable, and secure, thereby eliminating barriers to interoperability and fostering a more interconnected blockchain landscape. 

 ### Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem? 

 While there are several projects within the Substrate, Polkadot, and Kusama ecosystems that focus on cross-chain communication, none offer the unique features and performance capabilities that our adaptation of Hyperlane provides. For example, none can offer remote Chainlink price feeds as well as interchain accounts. We also believe none of them offer the breadth of integrations we will be able to provide to not only EVM networks but also to Cosmos and Solana based chains.  

#### Are there similar projects in related ecosystems?  

In related ecosystems, there are projects like Cosmos' Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) that aim to achieve cross-chain communication. In fact, the Interchain accounts feature has been heavily inspired by the Cosmos ideas.
