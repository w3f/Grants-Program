## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

ink! analyzer is a collection of modular and reusable libraries and tools for semantic analysis of [ink!](https://use.ink/) smart contract code.

#### Objective

ink! analyzer aims to improve [ink!](https://use.ink/) language support in [integrated development environments (IDEs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment), [source code editors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-code_editor) and other development tools by providing modular and reusable building blocks for implementing features like diagnostic errors, code completion suggestions, code/intent actions and hover content for the [ink! programming language](https://use.ink/) which is used for writing smart contracts for blockchains built on [Substrate](https://substrate.io/).

#### Problem
ink! is an [Embedded Domain Specific Language (eDSL)](https://wiki.haskell.org/Embedded_domain_specific_language) that you can use to write [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org) based smart contracts in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) programming language.
In fact, ["ink! is just standard Rust in a well-defined "contract format" with specialized `#[ink(â€¦)]` attribute macros"](https://use.ink/getting-started/creating-an-ink-project). 

This allows ink! developers to leverage Rust tooling like [clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/), [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/), [crates.io](https://crates.io/) and excellent IDE/code editor support via [rust-analyzer](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/) and [IntelliJ Rust](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/).

However, relying on only generic Rust language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools has some significant limitations for the developer experience including:
 
- No language support (e.g. diagnostic errors) for ink!'s domain specific semantic rules for smart contracts (e.g. exactly one `#[ink(storage)]` struct, at least one `#[ink(message)]` method and the same for `#[ink(constructor)]`, ink! attributes should be applied to items of the correct type e.t.c)
- Inconsistent editor experience with issues like no code completion and/or hover content for some ink! attribute macro arguments (e.g `#[ink(payable)]`) because [macro expansion/name resolution and trait resolution are hard problems for generic IDE/code editor tools](https://rust-lang.github.io/compiler-team/working-groups/rls-2.0/#scope-and-purpose) (see also [https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2021/11/21/ides-and-macros.html](https://rust-analyzer.github.io/blog/2021/11/21/ides-and-macros.html)).

#### Solution

To solve the above challenges and improve ink! language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools, this project will create two main components: 
- a modular domain-specific semantic analysis library for ink!.
- a [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) implementation built on top of the aforementioned semantic analysis library.

These two components can then be reused to add ink! language support to multiple IDEs, code editors and other development tools. 

In particular, a large number of IDEs and code editors support LSP servers, these include [Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim / Neovim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, Acme, Lapce, Eclipse and many more](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).
This project makes it relatively easy for any developer to write extensions/plugins/integrations that add ink! language support to any tool with support for LSP servers.

While for IDEs, code editors and other development tools that don't support LSP servers, extensions/plugins/integrations can either implement their own LSP client middleware or use the semantic analyzer directly.
However, this grant application will focus on an LSP based architecture.

Lastly, this project will implement a [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) extension that adds ink! language support to the editor as a reference implementation and showcase. 
However, other developers will be encouraged to leverage the above components to add ink! language support to their preferred IDE, code editor or other development tool.

#### Observation

In the context of smart contracts and the blockchain ecosystem, [static code analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) tends to be closely associated with security and vulnerability detection.
This project uses the narrower term "semantic analysis" because its primary goal (at this stage) is to improve ink! language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools. 
Therefore, initially, ink! analyzer will not provide any features related to security and vulnerability detection. 
However, such functionality may be added in the future.

#### Architecture Components

##### 1. Semantic Analyzer

The semantic analyzer is responsible for parsing the smart contract code, analyzing it based on ink!'s semantic rules for smart contracts and returning semantic information for other components to consume. 

It will be written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and will use rust-analyzer's [ra_ap_syntax](https://docs.rs/ra_ap_syntax/latest/ra_ap_syntax/) crate for generating the syntax tree of the smart contract code that it analyzes. 
It will have an internal architecture similar to rust-analyzer's [ra_ap_ide](https://docs.rs/ra_ap_ide/latest/ra_ap_ide/) crate with notions of persistent state, change over time, immutable snapshots of state and cancellable transactions.

While ink!'s [ink_ir](https://docs.rs/ink_ir/latest/ink_ir/) crate includes syntax tree and intermediate representation (IR) modules, the semantic analyzer will use rust-analyzer libraries because the [ink_ir](https://docs.rs/ink_ir/latest/ink_ir/) crate uses [syn](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/) as its parser and syn (being ["geared toward use in Rust procedural macros"](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/)) [assumes "that all input to it is well-formed"](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2256#issuecomment-353753261).
This makes it unsuitable for our IDE/code editor use case, because among [other design goals](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/syntax.md#design-goals) for this use case, parsing should be:
- resilient (even if the input is invalid, parser tries to see as much syntax tree fragments in the input as it can).
- lossless (even if the input is invalid, the tree produced by the parser represents it exactly).

Because of these and other [design goals](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/syntax.md#design-goals), rust-analyzer created its own parsing and syntax tree libraries instead of using the rust compiler's original libsyntax parser or [syn](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/) as articulated in the [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2256) that [initiated its development](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2256#issuecomment-451933766).
ink! analyzer follows the same rationale in choosing rust-analyzer's libraries over [ink_ir](https://docs.rs/ink_ir/latest/ink_ir/)'s [syn](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/) based modules. 

As a concrete example, for the !ink/Rust code snippet below that contains only one invalid line, [syn](https://docs.rs/syn/latest/syn/) simply returns an error while [ra_ap_syntax](https://docs.rs/ra_ap_syntax/latest/ra_ap_syntax/) still generates a lossless syntax tree with errors represented by "error nodes", thus allowing analysis to still be performed on the rest of the valid code.
```rust
#[ink::contract]
mod flipper {

    #[ink(storage)]
    pub struct Flipper {
        value: bool,
    }

    bad statement; // This is an invalid line
}
```

However, [ink_ir](https://docs.rs/ink_ir/latest/ink_ir/) and related crates and modules will still be used as reference implementations for ink! semantic rule validation.

##### 2. Language Server

The language server implements the [Language Server Protocol (LSP)](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) and acts as a backend that provides language support features like diagnostic errors, code completion suggestions, code/intent actions and hover content to IDEs, code editors and other development tools.
It uses the semantic analyzer as the engine for providing ink! language support features by:
- translating LSP requests into semantic analyzer interface calls.
- translating semantic analysis results into corresponding LSP types.

It can be reused by multiple IDEs, code editors and other development tools that support LSP servers including [Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim / Neovim, Emacs, Atom, Sublime Text, Acme, Lapce, Eclipse and many more](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/implementors/tools/).

It will be written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and will use rust-analyzer's [lsp-server](https://docs.rs/lsp-server/latest/lsp_server/) crate to handle LSP protocol handshaking and parsing messages.

##### 3. Extension/Plugin/Integrations for IDE, Code Editor or Development Tool 

Extensions/plugins/integrations add ink! language support to a specific IDE, code editor or development tool by communicating with the language server running as a separate process using the [Language Server Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) via [JSON-RPC](https://www.jsonrpc.org/).

Only a VS Code extension will be implemented at this stage of the project.
The VS Code extension will be written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) using VS Code's [extension API](https://code.visualstudio.com/api).

#### Technology Stack

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) - will be used for implementing the semantic analyzer and language server components.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - will be used for implementing the VS Code extension.

### Ecosystem Fit

This project will provide building blocks for improving ink! language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools thus improving the developer experience for ink! smart contract developers.
It will additionally implement an extension for VS Code, [one of the most popular code editors for developers](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-technologies-integrated-development-environment), that will also serve as a showcase and reference implementation that other developers can use as a guide for adding ink! language support to their preferred IDE or code editor if it supports LSP servers.

I'm not currently aware of any similar projects in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem.
However, for [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/) and the [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/) ecosystem, there are many IDE and code editor extensions/plugins (e.g. [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JuanBlanco.solidity), [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=NomicFoundation.hardhat-solidity) and [this](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AckeeBlockchain.tools-for-solidity) for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Solidity plugin for IntelliJ](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/9475-solidity)), 
a few language server implementations (e.g. [this](https://github.com/NomicFoundation/hardhat-vscode/tree/development/server) and [this](https://ackeeblockchain.com/woke/docs/2.1.0/language-server/) which are both used by their respective VS Code extensions)
and a few static code analyzers, including [Remix Analyzer](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project/tree/master/libs/remix-analyzer) which is specifically built for IDEs and code editors.

**NOTE:** The only open source smart contract static code analyzer for the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem I could find is [Vanguard](https://github.com/Veridise/Vanguard), however it operates on [LLVM](https://llvm.org/) bytecode and is therefore not usable as a building block for improving high-level language support in IDEs, code editors and other development tools.

## Development Status :open_book:

I've developed a proof of concept (POC) for the semantic analyzer that can be accessed on Github at [https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-analyzer](https://github.com/ink-analyzer/ink-analyzer).
The POC implements a diagnostic that detects when the `#[ink::contract]` attribute is applied to anything other than a `mod` item and returns a diagnostic model that includes an error message and the text range to which the diagnostic applies.

|      1. | Rust library crate: Diagnostic errors | I will create a Rust library crate with an interface that accepts ink! smart contract code as input and returns diagnostic errors based on ink!'s semantic rules. Diagnostic errors will include: conflicting ink! attributes and/or arguments based on the item being annotated and list of ink! attribute arguments (e.g `#[ink(storage)]` applied to anything other than a struct), missing required ink! attributes (e.g no `#[ink(constructor)]`, `#[ink(storage)]` or  `#[ink(message)]` in a contract mod), multiple annotations of attributes and/or arguments that can only be applied to one item in a contract (e.g multiple `#[ink(storage)]` structs or more than one wildcard selector among `#[ink(message)]`, as well as `#[ink(constructor)]` methods), duplicate ink! attributes on an item (e.g multiple `#[ink(message)]` annotations on one method), overlapping `#[ink(constructor)]`and `#[ink(message)]` selectors. |

| **0d.** | Docker                       | I will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|     0e. | Article                      | I will publish an **article** that explains how to use all the components of ink! analyzer, including the VS Code extension, the language server and the semantic analyzer.                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|      1. | Visual Studio Code Extension | I will create a Visual Studio Code Extension that supports the ink! language support features provided by the language server and semantic analyzer as outlined in milestones 1, 2 and 3 above (i.e diagnostic errors, code completion suggestions, code/intent actions and hover content as defined in the respective milestones above).                               |

## Future Plans

I will publish the VS Code extension to the [VS Code marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) and share it along with the code and documentation for all ink! analyzer components in Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem developer communities.

In the short-term, I will likely apply for follow-up funding for:
- adding more features to existing components.
- maintaining existing components.
- adding new reusable components for tools that don't support LSP.

As the project is a public good, the long-term goal is to create a community of users, contributors and ecosystem partners who are invested in the project's long-term success because of its utility.
