# Open Grant Proposal


* **Project Name:** Vera Defi Phase 1
* **Team Name:** Team Vera
* **Payment Address:** 0x94637b309B477388656B06f86A2604D202123583

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  
Vera DeFi is a key component of Vera Protocol, a larger vision to build an open protocol that enables the  lending, borrowing and exchange of NFT assets on the blockchain by leveraging hash signatures of object scan,  NFC smart tags and decentralized oracles. As a Substrate-based  application, Vera DeFi smart contracts will manage unique asset identities, interest, and payment, enabling users to loan assets for token payout. 

  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  
  Core Smart contract components will be developed in Ink on substrate. We will research integrating oracles like paralink. 
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.
  
  Like how Bitcoin and Ethereum have enabled trustless decentralized payments of digital assets between strangers, our vision is to enable the trustless retail or exchange of physical goods and assets between strangers without reliance on a centralized marketplace. In light of recent censorships taken by Big Tech oligopolies, our mission is to be an alternative platform for decentralized, censorship-resistant digital commerce and DeFi applications both for digital and real-world assets and physical consumer goods. The Vera team looks forward to working closely with its community to build an ecosystem that empowers and rewards entrepreneurs, inventors, and producers of consumer goods and protect the fundamental human right to buy, sell, or trade property we create and own.

#### NFT Exchange
NFT decentralized non-custodial marketplace will facilitate P2P trading between sellers and buyers. The process will be controlled by the ExchangeManager contract. It will provide the following functionality: 

##### _createTrade_

    Input: 
        NFT address, the tokenID
        Address in which they want to get paid and the amount 
        Expiration date . 
    Output:
    Tx ID

This function will be used by sellers to list a new trade opportunity. 

When called, the user will be asked to approve the transaction, and the NFTs will be transferred to the smart contract . The function 	will generate a unique trade ID.

##### _Purchase_
    Inputs:
        Tx ID

This function will be called by buyers to perform a trade by sending  the trade ID. The function will get the tokens to pay with from them,  they need to approve them first, collect a fee, and send the rest to the seller. At the same time, it will send the NFTs to the buyer. The trade is then marked as completed.

##### _expireTrade_
	Inputs:
        Tx ID

This function can be called by a seller to expire a non fulfilled trade to recover their NFT token. 

##### _withdrawFees_

The administrator of the smart contract can call this function to withdraw fees.

##### _ListTrades_
    Inputs: None
    Outputs:
        List of available NFT for sale with details.

#### NFT Lending

NFT Lending functionality is provided by our AssetManager Smart contract. 

##### _listToken_

    Input: 
        NFT address, the tokenID
        Address in which they want to get paid and the amount 
        Loan duration
    Output:
        Tx ID

This function will be used by borrowers to list a new loan opportunity. 

When called, the user will be asked to approve the transaction, and the NFTs will be transferred to the smart contract as collateral. The function will generate a unique trade ID.


##### _lend_
    Inputs:
        Tx ID

This function will be called by investors to perform a trade by sending the trade ID. The function will get the tokens to pay with from them.


##### _withdraw_
    Inputs:
        Tx ID

This function will be called by borrower to pay back their loans with interest and get back the NFT

##### _cancleLoan_
    Inputs:
        Tx ID

This function will be called by the investor to get NFT from the smart contract when the borrower fails to pay back on time.

##### _expireLoan_
	Inputs:
        Tx ID

This function can be called by a borrower to expire a non fulfilled loan to recover their NFT token. 

##### _listLoans_
