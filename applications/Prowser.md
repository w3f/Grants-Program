## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

A web browser that integrates Polkadot network capabilities and crypto mining/staking requires a multi-layered architecture. This solution prioritizes speed, security, and seamless blockchain integration.

The development will be using Javascript/TypeScript for core logic development. 


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

A web browser that integrates Polkadot network capabilities and crypto mining/staking requires a multi-layered architecture. This solution prioritizes speed, security, and seamless blockchain integration.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- The project is a simple user focused application (Hybrid DApp) that enables users to earn rewards for time they spend via the browser.
- Polkadot Users. Anyone that browses the Web. 
- It helps create a lightweight application that helps users leverage Blockchain technology into their Web operations. 
- I have conducted extensive research, and on a comprehensive gap analysis using identification methodologies have been able to identify a market requirement.
- Several projects in the ecosystem intersect with user incentives, staking, or browser-based engagement, but none directly replicate the model of a Web browser that mines/stakes Polkadot (DOT) and Kusama (KSM) based on browser usage.
- **Brave Browser (Basic Attention Token - BAT)**  
   - **Similarity**: Brave rewards users with BAT tokens for viewing privacy-preserving ads, which can be converted to other cryptocurrencies or fiat.
- **Polkadot.js Wallet/Extension**  
   - **Similarity**: Enables users to manage and stake DOT/KSM.  
   - **Difference**: Polkadot.js is a wallet/utility tool, not a browser that passively rewards users for usage. Your project merges browsing and staking into a single user experience.
- **Bitfari (Decentralized Ad Network on Polkadot)**  
   - **Similarity**: Incentivizes users for engaging with ads.  
   - **Difference**: Bitfari is a decentralized ad platform, not a browser, and does not involve staking or mining DOT/KSM.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

> [!CAUTION]
> If any of your deliverables are based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish *under the terms of the license* of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Projects that submit other people's work without proper attribution will be immediately terminated.**
