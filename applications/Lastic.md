## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

 - Lastic is a pioneering blockspace marketplace developed on Polkadot.
 - Our mission with Lastic is to democratize Polkadot blockspace, offering cost-effective and accessible solutions. Our marketplace facilitates the purchase and sale of 'Coretime,' aiming to normalize pricing, present user-centric payment options, and possibly launch subscription or futures offerings. With Lastic, deploying or extending a Polkadot project becomes seamless.
 - Our faith in the coretime model underscores Polkadot’s leadership in modular blockspace. To create a universal blockspace marketplace, we believe Polkadot’s advanced technology is unparalleled.

### Project Details
The complete vision of Lastic is a broad and intensive endeavor that involves building on technology that is not yet complete nor wholly available. Our journey in this space reveals the risks of investing heavily in transient technologies. In alignment with the Web3 Foundation grant's objectives, our focus remains on forward-thinking strategies that offer tangible value. **Thus, our proposal emphasizes developing a user interface (UI) tailored for the Coretime Parachain.**

This grant's goal is to create a UI within the limitations of `the broker pallet` being still in development and not deployed as a testnet yet. Concurrently, we will devise a **static mockup**, with simulated data, illustrating user interactions with the future coretime chain.

Grant Objectives:
 - Construct a UI mockup dedicated for future interactivity with the Coretime chain.
 - Envision limited interactivity based on features presently available in the `broker pallet`. This is contingent on the running the pallet as a substrate node locally.

Exclusions for this grant:
 - Real-time data derived via indexers on cores acquired historically.
 - Interaction beyond the limited functionality within the scope of this grant.
 - Functionalities allowing Polkadot users to alter cores, such as fragmentation.
 - The capability for buying or selling coretime on secondary markets, which remains Lastic's long-term vision.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Role in the Ecosystem**: Lastic seamlessly integrates within the Polkadot ecosystem, offering users an intuitive interface to assess the real-time status of coretime. This includes insights into available cores, owned cores, sales prospects for coretime, task allocations, newly created regions, regions within the instantaneous coretime pool, and transactions related to instantaneous coretime.
  
- **Target Audience**: Our primary user base encompasses:
  - Parachain teams looking for blockspace to expand or optimize their projects.
  - dApp developers aiming to ensure smooth and scalable operations.
  - Smart contract developers seeking efficient blockspace management.
  - Collators and validators striving for enhanced network optimization.
  - Coretime providers looking for a transparent space to offer their services.
  - Polkadot analysts and analytics providers in need of real-time coretime data.
  - MEV actors aiming to maximize their strategies.
  - DOT holders keen on understanding and optimizing their blockspace assets.
  
- **Addressing the Needs**: The Lastic UI is meticulously designed to cater to users desiring a simplified yet comprehensive overview of the coretime landscape on Polkadot. In the broader vision, along with providing a better user experience for those looking to buy Bulk and Instantanious Coretime, Lastic plans to pioneer a robust secondary marketplace for Polkadot's blockspace. This platform will facilitate the buying and selling of blockspace, supporting projects that need expansion or those that have excess blockspace to offer.

- **Comparison to Existing Solutions**: When evaluating the existing landscape within the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, we found no projects that are currently in development with Lastic's vision or offerings, making our initiative unique and essential.

### Team's experience

#### **Phil Lucsok**: 
Phil began his career in web3 as a marketing and communications manager for a Bitcoin startup in Berlin in 2013 called [BitcoinsBerlin](https://web.archive.org/web/20220707055043/https://bitcoinsberlin.com/). There, he created marketing campaigns for multiple products including:
- [All4BTC](https://all4btc.com/) - a one-stop shop for purchasing anything on Amazon or eBay with bitcoin
- Bills4BTC (later [Bitwala](https://bitwala.com/), Nuri) - a SEPA-compliant payment method for holders of Bitcoin for regular payments
- e4BTC - an electronics shop supporting purchases in Bitcoin

After this, he worked for 3.5 years at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), a web2 social media platform for scientific researchers, where he learned skills in Product Management, Product Analytics, UX development and copywriting and design, and industry-standard growth practices.

In late 2017, Phil joined Parity Technologies to lead technical communications on Ethereum and Polkadot. There he worked closely with developers to create promotional content for open-source products including Parity Ethereum, Parity Signer, Polkadot.js. It was between 2018 and 2020 where he represented Parity in Ethereum governance to help recover the stuck funds from the November 2017 multisig hack. 

He led the communications team for the first two years, growing the team from 1 to 12, where they created and executed the launch strategies for Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate. After that he joined the Ecosystem Success team to work with parachain teams to improve their communications and act as a liason between Substrate Builders Program teams and Parity.

Phil currently works as a freelancer but is focused on leading [Missing Link](https://www.missing-link.io/)'s marketing, communications and governance strategies. He is also an active participant in Polkadot governance discussions on the Kusamarian and in ChaosDAO.

*Note: Phil Lucsok has not previously applied for a grant at the Web3 Foundation.*

## Development Status & Progress

The main hub of our grant-related development is the [LasticUI Repository](https://github.com/LasticXYZ/LasticUI). The groundwork of this repository stems from the [substrate frontend template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template), providing us with a robust starter code.

We're progressing by configuring our frontend development environment locally, leveraging the Substrate framework, and establishing a direct connection with it. Detailed setup and operational instructions can be accessed in the repository's [README.md](https://github.com/LasticXYZ/LasticUI/blob/main/README.md).

Our secondary [Lastic Repository](https://github.com/LasticXYZ/Lastic) is currently private but will soon transition to public access. This space captures our internal deliberations framed as issues, preliminary whitepaper drafts, and an essential frontend for our main website, [lastic.xyz](https://www.lastic.xyz/), augmented with pertinent links.

## Future Plans

- Lastic aims to become a secondary marketplace for blockspace on Polkadot using its new Agile Coretime model
- We intend to first build out a UI for the community to gather, assess, and analyze the state of Coretime including its availability and sales
- After Agile Coretime is enabled on Rococo, we will plug in our UI so that it can become useful to the community right away
- Lastic will support Rococo, Kusama and Polkadot
- Users will be able to purchase coretime in the 'default' methods of bulk and instantaneous via Lastic
- Users will be able to use Lastic as a way to view, paritition, resell, purchase, and trade coretime in various ways
- The long-term vision for Lastic is that it will be the one place for ANY user to buy and sell blockspace on Polkadot, regardless of the state machine or smart contract or application they have.
- Lastic aims to support features for the upcoming roadmap laid out in the RFCs, for example Coreplay and Corejam

### On the Horizon: Frontend Development with Blockchain Integration:

Initiation Timeline: Post the release of W3F's branch on the Rococo testnet, followed by data availability for real-time functionality testing. Estimated commencement: 4 months post-Rococo testnet launch, with the mainnet integration slated 3-6 months thereafter.

Developmental Milestones:

 - Integration with Subquery to facilitate efficient storage querying.
 - Design and implement a dynamic pricing simulation tool.
 - Facilitate smooth synchronization with testnet, subsequently followed by devnet.
 - Establish a robust secondary marketplace, ensuring it undergoes rigorous testing phases.
 - Pave the way for feature enablement on major platforms such as Polkadot and Kusama's mainnets.
 - Dedicated efforts towards crafting a user-centric interface for the secondary marketplace. For a preliminary glimpse of our vision, refer to the mockup showcased below:
