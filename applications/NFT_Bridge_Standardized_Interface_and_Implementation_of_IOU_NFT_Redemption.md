# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Standardized Interface and Implementation of IOU NFT Redemption
* **Team Name:** Perpetual Altruism 
* **Payment Address:** 1B6AHziiBvE28Lg74n23V3dYXbxcVLGKYi

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

This proposal is in response to Polkadot Bridge RFP.
### Overview
In this proposal, we use the following terms and definitions:   
   
* *NFT:* Intangible asset that is compatible with the ERC-721 standard (i.e. the unique intangible asset is abstracted from the concept of token, which is how the asset is represented on a blockchain). An NFT always exists in a world, which is itself in a universe.   
   
* *Universe* e.g. a blockchain, the Web2.0 internet, a private company’s database…   
   
* *World (within a universe)* e.g. a smart contract or smart contract ecosystem, a website, a private company project…   
   
* *Migration:* The movement of an NFT from an origin universe to a destination universe.   
    
* *IOU migration:* An NFT migration where the original token is put in escrow in the origin universe bridge, and a deed that allows the bearer to redeem that original token in the origin universe is created in the destination universe.   
     
* *Full migration:* An NFT migration which is handled by the publisher of the NFT, who controls the destination world, and thus can allow the NFT’s features and intellectual property rights to be transferred to the new token in the destination universe.   
     
* *Digital Rights Management:* The systematic approach to prevent unauthorized redistribution of digital rights and intellectual property rights infringement during a full NFT migration.   


The aim of the proposal is to establish a standard that ensures that only the owner redeeming an IOU or migrated token receives the original token that was put in escrow. This standard is an extension / amendment of the NFT migration token defined in our [Open Grant Proposal #1](./NFT_Bridge_Protocol_for_NFT_Migration_and_Data_Exchange.md).


A deed to an underlying asset only has value if the underlying asset can eventually be redeemed. Recovering the original escrowed token is a different exercise to creating a new token. Every parachain that wishes to migrate NFTs back and forth will need a solution.

Our team is building NFT.com, a marketplace for the world’s tokenized assets and we need this infrastructure for our marketplace to work effectively on the Polkadot Network. Previous to this we also developed [Cryptograph](https://cryptograph.co), an NFT publisher and marketplace on Ethereum.

### Project Details 
The deliverable of this proposal is a fully functioning IOU redemption bridge for EVM use, with the associated standards.

### Ecosystem Fit 
To our knowledge, there is currently no work being done on a standardized, universal NFT bridge for cross-chain redemption.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 
### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Less than 4 weeks
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  2 FTE
* **Total Work Days:** 37 days
* **Cost per work day:** £300
* **Total Costs:** £11,100

### Milestone 1 — Interface for IOU Migration and Redemption 
* **Estimated Duration:** ~1 week
* **FTE:**  2 FTE
* **Work Days:** 12 days
* **Cost per work day:** £300
* **Costs:** £3,600

Establish a standardized set of functions for an IOU owner sending an IOU to a bridge with the intent of redeeming the original token, based upon the NFT migration protocol defined in our [Open Grant Proposal #1](./NFT_Bridge_Protocol_for_NFT_Migration_and_Data_Exchange.md) and 2 [Open Grant Proposal #2](./NFT_Bridge_Standardized_Interface_and_Implementation_of_IOU_NFT_Migration.md).
* Write a Predicate & Postulate for each function
* Provide an EVM compatible (Solidity) interface.
* Enable IOU migration, both checked and unchecked. 
* Enable working redemption whether it was checked or unchecked migration regardless of the original migration method used.
* Provide documentation

### Milestone 2 — Solidity Implementation
* **Estimated Duration:** ~2 weeks
* **FTE:**  2
* **Work Days:** 25 days
* **Cost per work day:** £300
* **Costs:** £7,500

Code a barebone Solidity implementation of the previously defined interface(s).
* The code will have complete unit-test coverage to ensure functionality and robustness. A testing guide will describe how to run these tests   
* We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of the code.   
* We will provide documentation   

## Future Plans
Creating a marketplace (NFT.com) where any NFT from any chain can be traded.
