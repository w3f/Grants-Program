## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The DOT open source developer community is expanding rapidly, yet there is currently no way to easily monitor development progress across various projects that integrates with the DOT ecosystem. Keeping track of development progress across various projects and monitoring developer contributions can provide valuable insights into the evolution of DOT ecosystem. With data dispersed throughout Github, including contributors, commits, issues, repositories, and PRs, it can be challenging to grasp the overall progress of the DOT ecosystem.

I am presenting PolkaFlow to the DOT community as the ultimate solution for visualizing and analyzing open source projects within the ecosystem. It offers a comprehensive view of activities of projects and insights into the ecosystem's trends. The project will allow users to gain insights into the development activity, code contributions, issue resolution, and community engagement of the DOT ecosystem through open source projects. This information will be displayed through various visualizations and charts, which will be accessible through a web-based application named **PolkaFlow**.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Target audience**

The target audience for PolkaFlow can include developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who are interested in monitoring the development and activity of open-source projects on the DOT ecosystem. The platform's analytical tools and visualizations can provide valuable insights into the performance of various projects, making it useful for those who want to gain a better understanding of the ecosystem's progress and the direction it's headed in.

Besides, by tracking the activity of commits history, and issue resolution PolkaFlow can help developers identify areas where they can improve and streamline their own development processes. By offering detailed analytics, PolkaFlow can become an essential tool for anyone who is interested in the development and progress of the DOT ecosystem.

**Evidence for the need**

* **Increased Interest in DOT Ecosystem:** The growth of the DOT ecosystem and the increasing number of open-source projects being developed on the protocol highlight the need for a tool that can monitor and analyze the performance of these open-source projects. PolkaFlow can provide valuable insights for the projects within the ecosystem.

* **Lack of Comprehensive Analytics:** There is a lack of reliable and user-friendly tools that can provide detailed analytics and visualizations for open-source projects on DOT ecosystem. Besides, the demand for better analytical tools in the blockchain space is increasing, and developers and stakeholders are seeking tools that can help them monitor and analyze the performance of the projects. PolkaFlow fills this gap for the DOT ecosystem.

* **Historical and Trend Data:**: PolkaFlow can provide a historical and trend data of the Github activity in the DOT ecosystem, allowing developers and project managers to see first hand how the ecosystem is growing, evolving, and changing over time. This data can be used to identify patterns, trends, and areas of improvement, leading to more informed decision making and better outcomes for the projects within the ecosystem.

**Impact**

* **Improve Project Visibility**: By providing detailed analytics and visualizations for DOT projects, PolkaFlow can help increase the visibility of these projects, making it easier for developers and users to find and contribute to them.

* **Enhance Developer Productivity**: With the ability to quickly access important data and metrics, developers can more easily identify areas of the project that need attention. This can lead to faster issue resolution and more efficient development cycles.

* **Encourage Community Engagement**: By providing a centralized location for viewing project activity and contributions, PolkaFlow can encourage community engagement and collaboration. Users can easily identify areas where they can contribute to the project and engage with other developers and users.

* **See Ecosystem Evolution**: PolkaFlow can help show the evolution of DOT projects over time by providing historical data and visualizations of key metrics, enabling developers to better understand the project's development trajectory and identify areas where protocol gains trends.

* **Stands Out**: Currently, there is no project that provides a comprehensive analytics dashboard for open-source projects in the DOT ecosystem. PolkaFlow fills this gap and provides value by enabling developers and stakeholders to easily gain insights into the activity and performance of DOT projects.

## Development Status :open_book:

PolkaFlow is already deployed on Vercel and can be accessed via `polkaflow.vercel.app`. The project is currently in the MVP stage with Milestone 1 completed. Initially 17 repositories are added to the platform because of the demo purposes. After the approve, the project will have more repositories curated by me (or requests from the DOT Team) and the more can be added by the DOT community via Submit button in the app.

## Future Plans

In the short term, we intend to use PolkaFlow to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly platform for developers and ecosystem users to track and analyze projects in the DOT ecosystem. We will continuously enhance and update the platform to ensure that it is the go-to resource for up-to-date information on DOT projects. 

In the long term, our team's plan is to continue supporting and improving PolkaFlow to meet the evolving needs of the DOT community. This includes incorporating additional metrics and data sources to provide more detailed insights into projects. Besides, if the platform is well-received by the community, and gains traction, we are going to open a Twitter account for PolkaFlow to engage with the community and promote top open-source projects on the DOT ecosystem.
