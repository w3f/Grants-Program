This could have a significant impact on mass adoption.</p><p>This legal protection is brought by the decentralization of legal officers&#x27; capabilities put at the service of the blockchain ecosystem and the digital economy. </p><ul><li><p>Data verification and certification: Certify and check content, digital assets and data, thus authenticating and providing a guarantee, enforceable in 150+ countries.	</p></li><li><p>Protection, confidentiality : Protect document, assets and critical data under a strict legally binding confidentiality and access rules.		</p></li><li><p>Escrow: Offer digital assets escrow and oversee critical transactions when required by law.</p></li><li><p>Proof: Draw up Judicial Officer&#x27;s report, usable as conclusive evidence with a time stamp in case of claim, front a court of justice.</p></li></ul><p>These state-appointed legal officers, clearly identified by the logion network, are generally bound by a legal regime and strict rules well known for a long time.</p><p><strong>logion wallet</strong> is a decentralized wallet, highly secured by legal officers with privacy, asset protection, escrow, multi-signature and institutionalized social recovery by design.</p><p>The logion wallet provides access to legal protection for:</p><ul><li><p>Digital assets: its on-chain character offer to the digital assets it contains a direct link to the intrinsic legal protection provided by logion legal officers (LLO).</p></li><li><p>Digital transactions: it enables user identification and access to the legal protection provided by logion legal officers on all digital transactions with referenced content on the logion network.</p></li></ul><p>In practice, two wallet functionalities can be used to demonstrate the utility of a legal protection on the possession of digital assets and the execution of digital transactions: </p><ul><li>Asset recovery</li><li>Multisig</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="asset-recovery">Asset recovery<a class="hash-link" href="#asset-recovery" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>Holding digital assets represents huge responsibilities. </p><p>Within the blockchain world, losing access to its wallet due to a lost private key, JSON file or recovery phrase is a common occurrence. This also happens when the wallet user is physically unable (disability or death) to provide his or her access to a relative.
Because it is necessary to use private information or file to access blockchain-wallet, its securisation is absolutely essential to not losing access to the digital assets it manages.</p><p>A social recovery functionality grants the right to trusted individuals, guardians - logion legal officers in our case - chosen by the user, to restore access to his wallet. Hence, if the wallet user loses the precious access, (s)he can call upon his or her legal officers who will strictly verify conditions and after would authorize the transfer of the lost funds from the lost wallet to a new wallet. </p><p>logion wallet social recovery functionality provides the user with a guarantee of permanent and legally secure access to his or her digital assets. </p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multisig">Multisig<a class="hash-link" href="#multisig" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The legal protection brought by logion legal officers can also be combined with multisignature functionality. </p><p>The idea of a multisig wallet is to require the signature of several key pairs held by one or several keyholder(s) to authorize a transaction. In general, it does not require all co-signers to sign the transaction (m -of-n type); m being the number of co-signers required to sign a valid transaction and n, the total number of signatories.</p><p>This specific configuration prevents two issues: </p><ul><li>Access to the wallet by bad actors: a single compromised access is not enough, you need several.</li><li>Loss of access for good actors: they don&#x27;t have temporary access to their wallet and they need an urgent transaction. logion could be a solution to authorize the execution of the transaction.</li></ul><p>logion wallet co-signers being logion legal officers, the wallet user benefits from a legal protection on the execution of any specific transaction(s) operated from his or her wallet.</p><p>This legal-grade security is provided by the full on-chain traceability of the signatures of logion co-signers being legal officers. Backed by their regulated profession, any unfortunate operation is prevented by possible penal pursuits. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a class="hash-link" href="#project-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>logion decentralized wallet aims at securing any kind of token that can be exchanged using Polkadot&#x27;s Cross-Chain Message Passing (XCMP). It essentially consists in a Web-based user interface connecting to logion&#x27;s Substrate-based chain and a set of decentralized off-chain services (see Architecture section for a detailed description).</p><p>The access to the tokens is guaranteed, even in case of partial or complete loss of credentials, thanks to an on-chain recovery process triggered by trusted parties (the logion legal officers).
Moreover, it is possible for a beneficiary to gain access to an account in the case where the initial owner becomes unavailable (because of death or another predefined reason). The process is based on the <code>recovery</code> FRAME pallet.</p><p>In addition, it will be possible to protect tokens from unwanted transfers (e.g. in case of stolen credentials) by requiring multiple signatures (one by the owner or a beneficiary, and one or several logion legal officers).
The process will be implemented by FRAME&#x27;s <code>multisig</code> pallet.</p><p>While above processes are well known and already implemented, they require off-chain logic to implement KYC processes and store confidential data that must not be published on-chain. At the same time, it is important that the off-chain logic remains as decentralized as possible.</p><p>This is the reason why the millestones have been organized in this way. First, the base of the Wallet, then all the off-chain logic which is necessary to enforce the logion process before completing with the multi-sig option.</p><p>Finally, logion aims at making them accessible to the largest public. A particular effort is therefore invested on user experience.

Only nodes owned by logion legal officers can join. Users connect to and interact with the network using a Web application.</p><p>A node directory service enables wallet users to choose the node they want to connect to. The list of authorized nodes is managed on-chain. The directory service reads it from there and links it to additional information about the legal officer actually managing each node.</p><p>By choosing a node, a wallet user actually selects the legal officer he/she trusts. A wallet user will share confidential data only with the legal officers he/she trusts because those data will be stored in the legal officer&#x27;s private database, whose content is not shared across the network.</p><p>Fault tolerance is achieved by storing encrypted backups of the private database into a private IPFS cluster.
Therefore, it is possible for a node owner to rebuild his/her node entirely just by plugging a new server
to the logion network.
The backup process consists in storing regular snapshots and very frequent deltas.
Each new stored snapshot triggers the deletion of older snapshots and deltas.</p><p>Each logion node runs</p><ul><li>a Substrate service,</li><li>IPFS/IPFS cluster services,</li><li>a private database service,</li><li>a logion off-chain service.</li></ul><p>Except for the Substrate node and the logion off-chain service, the other services are not accessible directly from
outside of the node. Indeed, the database and IPFS are used to store confidential data. The logion off-chain
service acts as a gateway granting access to the data stored in the database and IPFS only to authorized users through
a REST API.</p><p>Below figure illustrates the architecture of the logion network.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/883394/135598896-2ed3de2a-55ed-448d-b036-57193314a41d.png" alt="Logion architecture" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Note that there are 2 overlay networks inside of the logion network:</p><ul><li>the Substrate-based blockchain,</li><li>the IPFS cluster.</li></ul><p>Both networks are permissioned.</p><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technologies">Technologies<a class="hash-link" href="#technologies" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><ul><li><a href="https://substrate.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Substrate</a> - <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rust</a>-based modular framework for building

<!-- -->The node directory enables a user to select a logion node based on information about the legal officer
operating it. The service reads the list of authorized nodes from the logion chain. Additional data are submitted
by the node owners via a REST API. Submissions are authenticated by verifying that the submitter actually owns the
authorized node.</p></li><li><p><strong>logion substrate node</strong><br>
<!-- -->Logion uses a regular Substrate 3.0 node with, among others, 2 FRAME pallets installed:
<a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/frame#recovery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recovery</a> and
<a href="https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/runtime/frame#multisig" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">multisig</a>.</p></li><li><p><strong>logion off-chain service</strong><br>
<!-- -->The logion off-chain service exposes a REST API used by the logion Web application (see below).
The off-chain service enables the creation of protection requests by the wallet users.
Once the request is accepted by the legal officer, the user may enable the recovery on-chain. A protection request
may also be a recovery request, in which case it provides the address on which a recovery process should be executed.
When a legal officer accepts a recovery request, potentially after executing a kind of KYC, he/she also vouches
on-chain for the recovery (see
<a href="https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/latest/pallet_recovery/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentation of recovery pallet</a>).
Finally, the logion off-chain service maintains a cache of all movements on a user&#x27;s account enabling effective
querying and exploration.</p></li><li><p><strong>logion Web application</strong><br>
<!-- -->The logion Web application is used by both wallet users and legal officers. It enables a smooth communication between
them in order to organize an account&#x27;s protection and recovery or the need of multiple signatures for the transfer of
tokens. Account keys are managed with Polkadot JS&#x27;s browser extension for increased security and interoperability.</p></li></ul><h5 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a class="hash-link" href="#ecosystem-fit" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h5><p>To understand the contribution of logion to the DotSama ecosystem, we have to think in three steps:</p><ol><li>The blockchain technology brings trust by protecting the data and transactions through hashes it stores.</li><li>Polkadot brings to the blockchain ecosystem the most robust platform for security, scalability, project diversification through parachains and innovation.</li><li>logion brings to the Polkadot blockchain ecosystem a solution to trust data and transactions referred by the hashes it stores, before it processes them.</li></ol><p>logion brings to the blockchain cross-border &amp; decentralized legaltech services, with a blockchain of nodes owned by legal officers.
