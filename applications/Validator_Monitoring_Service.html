Public scanners like Subscan offer limited insights into validator performance, with scarce information such as earned points and rewards displayed only after an era&#x27;s end. This limitation prevents the use of existing scanners as real-time monitoring tools.</p><p>However, active participation in consensus is crucial for upholding network security. Each consensus round relies on obtaining 2/3 precommits, and validators failing to reach this threshold cannot contribute to blockchain security. If numerous validators encounter participation issues, it can reduce block production speed, adversely affecting the overall network.</p><p><strong>We truly believe that every validator operator should understand their role and significance in ensuring blockchain security.</strong></p><p>Furthermore, the information provided by public scanners predominantly focuses on individual addresses and specific events. At the same time, it allows for retrieving on-chain data such as reward payments and rewards points for a particular account. Scanners generally lack the capability to compare these rewards with those of other validators. This limitation hinders a comprehensive understanding of a chosen validator&#x27;s performance relative to others in the network. </p><p><strong>Our monitoring service effectively addresses this challenge by providing real-time data on validator performance and enabling performance comparisons with other validators.</strong></p><p>Moreover, besides public scanners, there are several existing solutions available for validator monitoring, such as <a href="https://github.com/SimplyVC/panic_polkadot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">P.A.N.I.C.</a>, <a href="https://github.com/galacticcouncil/polkalert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkalert</a>, <a href="https://github.com/nodebreaker0-0/substrate/tree/prometheus_v0.3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B-Harvest</a>, <a href="https://github.com/stakezone/nmonpolkadot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nmonpolkadot</a>, <a href="https://github.com/ironoa/polkadot-k8s-monitor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot-K8s-Monitor</a>, <a href="https://github.com/w3f/polkadot-watcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot-Watcher</a>, <a href="https://github.com/helikon-labs/polkadot-kusama-1kv-telegram-bot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ex-1KV Telegram Bot</a>, as well as, grant-supported dashboards <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/cyclops.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cyclops</a>. Our solution stands out due to several significant differences:</p><ol><li><strong>Out-of-the-box Solution:</strong> Unlike many existing applications that require hosting arrangements, our platform offers a hassle-free experience. Users can effortlessly try our product and assess its suitability for their needs by simply interacting with our Telegram bot and setting up a live dashboard. This accessibility enhances the popularity and adoption of our solution.</li><li><strong>Comprehensive Data:</strong> While most solutions provide standard on-chain data such as reward points, reward amounts, and on-chain events like offences or payouts, our platform goes beyond that. We offer unique data, including information on participation in the consensus, the selection of a para-validator, and para-validator points per session (not just per era). This granular data provides users with a more comprehensive understanding of validator performance.</li><li><strong>Ongoing Support:</strong> Many existing applications are developed by small teams and may need more ongoing support, with some repositories needing to be updated. In contrast, we are one of the largest validators in the network, and we commit to supporting and maintaining our validator monitoring platform. Additionally, we utilize the same system for our internal purposes, ensuring its reliability and continuous improvement.</li></ol><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="potential-users">Potential users<a href="#potential-users" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Potential users" title="Direct link to Potential users">​</a></h3><p>Our monitoring system caters to various parties within the community who can derive significant benefits from its usage:</p><ol><li><strong>Validator Operators:</strong> Our service is a valuable tool for validator operators, particularly small teams and independent validators who may lack the time and resources to develop their monitoring systems. For instance, meeting the strict requirements of programs like the 1KV program can be challenging for small and independent validators. With our monitoring system, they gain the ability to track an extensive range of metrics. By leveraging our service, validator operators can thrive within the decentralized ecosystem and enhance performance.</li><li><strong>Nominators:</strong> Nominators play a crucial role in the network by selecting validators to nominate. Our service provides nominators with detailed performance comparisons among different validators. They can evaluate critical metrics such as consensus participation, and block production efficiency relative to other validators. Our service empowers nominators to make informed decisions when choosing validators to nominate, optimizing their returns, and actively contributing to the network&#x27;s health.</li><li><strong>Foundation:</strong> By having access to comprehensive information on validator participation in consensus, block production efficiency, and other crucial metrics, the Foundation can identify and address any security vulnerabilities or potential risks promptly. This proactive approach helps to maintain a robust and secure network for all participants. Moreover, the Foundation can offer greater transparency to the community regarding validator performance</li></ol><p>Lastly, our team possesses extensive experience in maintaining validators within the Polkadot and Kusama networks, and we have developed the necessary monitoring and maintenance tools. <strong>We firmly believe that this knowledge should be shared for the benefit of the entire network rather than being kept private.</strong> Therefore, we seek a grant to further develop our monitoring system and contribute to the network&#x27;s advancement.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>We have developed a comprehensive monitoring platform as a service. This platform provides validator operators with an effortless monitoring solution, saving them valuable time and effort. With our service, operators can focus on other critical aspects of validator operations, knowing that their monitoring needs are taken care of.</p><p><strong>Our system could be depicted in the following picture:</strong></p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_7.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our current solution already offers a Grafana instance, which serves as a powerful dashboard. This dashboard displays real-time metrics of validators, enabling users to access and analyze the data easily. To simplify the setup process, we have integrated our platform with a user-friendly Telegram bot, @p2pvalidator_monitoring_bot. Through this bot, users can quickly configure their personal dashboards by selecting the validators they wish to monitor.</p><p>The live dashboard provides users with a comprehensive overview of all essential metrics related to their validators. These metrics are updated automatically every 20-40 seconds, ensuring real-time visibility into the performance of validators. This rapid update frequency enables users to respond to any changes or issues that may arise promptly.</p><p>Furthermore, we understand the importance of historical data in analyzing validator behavior and identifying potential issues. Therefore, our platform collects and stores data on all active validators for up to one month. This means that users have access to historical performance data, allowing them to conduct in-depth analyses of their validators over time. Such insights are invaluable for optimizing performance and addressing any emerging concerns.</p><p>In conclusion, our monitoring platform provides validator operators with a hassle-free solution, streamlining the monitoring process and offering real-time and historical data to support informed decision-making and efficient operations.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="system-workflow">System workflow<a href="#system-workflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to System workflow" title="Direct link to System workflow">​</a></h3><p>A user initiates a conversation with a Telegram bot and selects from options such as creating a new dashboard or connecting to support. When the user inputs the validator addresses they wish to monitor on the dashboard, our system verifies the authenticity of these addresses, confirming that they belong to validators. Then, the system generates the dashboard and sends the user their access credentials. Subsequently, the system resets the client&#x27;s session to prevent potential &#x27;double&#x27; events. This involves preserving the user&#x27;s current position in the workflow, for instance, preventing the triggering of a dashboard deletion before its creation.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_9.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Upon receiving a user&#x27;s request to deploy a dashboard, their specified validator addresses are recorded in a key-value file (values.yaml) associated with their Telegram ID and subsequently committed to Git. ArgoCD, set to check the repository every 5 minutes, will recognize if there isn&#x27;t a Grafana instance associated with the particular Telegram ID and proceed to deploy a new instance. As ArgoCD prepares the dashboard, GitHub Actions concurrently monitors the availability of this new instance. Once the instance is fully operational, GitHub Actions triggers a notification to the client, providing them with their login credentials.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_11.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our data collection process is anchored on utilizing exporters from the Blockchain. These exporters operate incessantly, amassing raw data directly from the Blockchain. Each exporter functions as an HTTP web endpoint for the scrapper, supplying plain text with specific metric values. Subsequently, this data is channeled into the Victoria Metrics cluster using VM insert, which timestamps each value. Ultimately, designated data is selected by a specific dashboard (Grafana instance) using VM select.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_8.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In our current implementation, we provide insights on the following key metrics:</p><ul><li>General indicators: we track session/era progression and staking data.<!-- -->  <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_6.png" class="img_ev3q"></li><li>Validator data per epoch: we provide information on rewards points, active validators, and their position in the active set.<!-- -->  <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_5.png" class="img_ev3q"></li><li>Era and epoch points for ParaValidators: we monitor ParaValidator points earned and their relation to the network&#x27;s average, median, and 95th percentile.<!-- -->  <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_4.png" class="img_ev3q">  <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_3.png" class="img_ev3q"></li><li>Finality metrics (GRANDPA): we track blocks&#x27; prevotes and precommits, and their ratio to ideally processed blocks.<!-- -->  <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_2.png" class="img_ev3q">  <img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/avtishin/maas/blob/main/pic_1.png" class="img_ev3q"></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Aleksandr Tishin, product manager, <a href="https://github.com/avtishin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/avtishin</a></li><li>Anton Zhbanov, tech team lead, <a href="https://github.com/base1217" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/base1217</a></li><li>Sergey Radchenko, SRE Engineer and Developer, <a href="https://github.com/SergeyRadchenkoP2P" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/SergeyRadchenkoP2P</a></li><li>Boris Simonov, SRE Engineer and Developer, <a href="https://github.com/xxbbxb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/xxbbxb</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-code-repos">Team Code Repos<a href="#team-code-repos" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team Code Repos" title="Direct link to Team Code Repos">​</a></h3><p>Project repo:</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/p2p-org/polkadot_monitoring_service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/p2p-org/polkadot_monitoring_service</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>The P2P development team, part of the reputable validator and non-custodial staking platform P2P, is the main driving force behind our monitoring solution.
