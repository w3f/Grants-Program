## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Quantum computation is one of the biggest threats to every cryptographic system in the mid future, including blockchains. While the level of computational capabilities currently available for quantum computers aren't enough to break the cryptography behind any blockchain project yet, it's expected that this will be achieved in the next years, potentially way before than what's predicted.
In order to be considered quantum-resistant, a blockchain must have the following characteristics:
- Rely on quantum-resistant cryptographic primitives for every event that requires digital signatures, such as signing transactions;
- Use a quantum-resistant communication protocol between nodes.

On August 28th, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) issued an official document stating that 4 algorithms will be standardized as official PQC.
[NIST Document available here](https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2023-18197/p-12)
Among the selected algorithms, the document cites:
  - CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm for key exchange;
  - CRYSTALS-Dilithium for asymmetric cryptography.

QuantumGuard is a project that aims to create a safe quantum-resistant parachain in the Polkadot environment, based on NIST-selected quantum-safe cryptographic algorithms. The parachain will enable the use of NIST-standardized quantum-safe algorithms for every crucial cryptographic operation, such as key generation, signing transactions and communication between nodes.


### Project Details

The current Grant application will focus on enabling quantum-safe cryptography for address generation and signing transaction in a Substrate-based blockchain. In order to achieve this, the development will focus on two objectives:

- Customization of Substrate crypto pallet in order to use CRYSTALS-Dilithium for addresses generation and signing transaction: in order to achieve this, it'll be used the Rust integration of CRYSTALS-dilithium algorithm as published in the following Github repository: https://github.com/pq-crystals/dilithium under Apache 2.0 License;
- A custom version of browser wallet extension (Polkadot.js or Talisman) which allows to store keyparis and sign transaction using CRYSTALS-Dilithium cryptography: this will be developed using the Javascript version of the CRYSTALS-dilithium algorithm published as npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/dilithium-crystals under MIT License, adapting it for the use with a Hierarchical Deterministic wallet.

### Ecosystem Fit

The ultimate goal of the project is to provide a full parachain that will act as a vault for every other parachain in the Polkadot environment, which do not use quantum-safe cryptography. Every address can bridge their asset to QuantumGuard and secure them, this way if the original blockchain gets attacked and informations get lost, they can still live in the quantum-safe vault.

## Future Plans

After the successful completion of the current Grant, the plan is to create a small team in order to bring the project to a further stage, on the path to a consolidate parachain project.

Next plans include:
* Implementation of post-quantum communication protocol between nodes, using NIST-selected CRYSTALS-KYBER algorithm;
* Creation of a network of several QuantumGuard nodes;
* Public testnet.
