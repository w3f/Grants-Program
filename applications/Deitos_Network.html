<p>Deitos Network aims to be a transparent, open, and decentralized platform dedicated to storage, data processing, modeling, and training.</p>
<p>The network is designed to facilitate collaboration between various infrastructure providers and consumers in need of big data-related services. This encompasses data scientists from startups, academic institutions, and other organizations. Through this engagement, infrastructure providers will receive financial compensation for their services.</p>
<p>The network allows processed and structured data to be utilized by AI and BI systems. This data can produce business analytics reports, predictive algorithms, clean datasets, and training sets, which can be used in different machine learning algorithms, analyses, and trend predictions.</p>

<p>We believe that a network like the one we envision can democratize access to structured big data and AI model training. The model we propose is designed for a flexible market fit that can cater to diverse requirements.</p>
<p>Blockchain technology offers a framework to create incentives for a decentralized network. This network can serve a public purpose by providing access to structured or trained data.</p>

<p>Polkadot SDK is set to be the backbone of the network, orchestrating rewards, data interactions, disputes, consensus, and integrity checks.</p>
<p>With the flexibility of Polkadot SDK, we can design a specific consensus algorithm that considers storage aspects, not just fund staking. On a broader scale, every infrastructure provider will operate a substrate node with an authoring role, and a minimum stake will be necessary to participate in the consensus.</p>
<p>Utilizing Polkadot SDK allows us to implement runtime updates without causing forks or interruptions in the active network.</p>

<p>These are entities responsible for providing the necessary infrastructure for all big data-related services. Additionally, they manage the substrate nodes that handle consensus-related operations.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consumers">Consumers<a href="#consumers" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consumers" title="Direct link to Consumers">â€‹</a></h4>
<p>As outlined in the project description, the user persona for this network encompasses any individual, entity, or organization requiring storage and computational resources for their data utilization. From the network&#x27;s standpoint, these consumers are token holders who, alongside infrastructure providers, keep the network operational.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dispute-resolvers-committee">Dispute Resolvers Committee<a href="#dispute-resolvers-committee" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Dispute Resolvers Committee" title="Direct link to Dispute Resolvers Committee">â€‹</a></h4>
<p>This group is tasked with resolving any disputes between consumers and infrastructure providers. Membership in this committee isn&#x27;t static. Individuals must first nominate themselves, after which all token holders can vote within a specified timeframe to determine the nominee&#x27;s inclusion. This election process is cyclical.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="network-parties-interaction-flow">Network parties interaction flow.<a href="#network-parties-interaction-flow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Network parties interaction flow." title="Direct link to Network parties interaction flow.">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>At a high level, when a consumer identifies an infrastructure provider that best suits their needs, they enter into an agreement. This agreement is based on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The volume of storage to be uploaded and analyzed.</li>
<li>The computational resources needed for data processing (e.g., vCores, RAM).</li>
<li>The duration agreed upon for the above two parameters.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given these criteria, the consumer compensates the infrastructure provider incrementally, provided the service aligns with the mutual agreement&#x27;s expectations. To ensure this, the consumer reserves a predetermined percentage of the total agreement value (also decided during the agreement). If there&#x27;s a breach of contract, a dispute resolution process begins, involving the Dispute Resolvers Committee. They determine if a party has defaulted, be it an infrastructure provider not delivering the agreed resources or a consumer raising unfounded complaints. Upon resolving the dispute, appropriate penalties are enforced, and the dispute resolvers receive compensation for their mediation efforts.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of each agreement, participants can review their counterpart. This feedback contributes to an on-chain reputation system, fostering more secure interactions as the network evolves. However, in the event of disputes, neither party can leave feedback. Instead, the dispute&#x27;s outcome is recorded in their respective profiles.</p>

<p><strong>Substrate Node</strong>: This is responsible for consensus and blockchain-related activities.</p>
<p><strong>Proxy</strong>: A custom module designed for routing requests and accesses, ensuring that resources from the infrastructure provider align with the security and mechanisms defined by the blockchain.</p>
<p><strong>HDFS Cluster</strong>: HDFS, or Hadoop Distributed File System, is a distributed file system designed to operate on standard hardware. It&#x27;s essential for distributed storage that supports extensive data processing.</p>
<p><strong>YARN</strong>: Handles resource management and job scheduling/monitoring.</p>
<p><strong>Spark</strong>: Apache Spark is a versatile engine that facilitates data engineering, data science, and machine learning tasks on both single-node machines and clusters.</p>
<p><strong>Hive</strong>: Apache Hive is a distributed and fault-tolerant data warehouse system, enabling large-scale analytics.</p>
<p><strong>Llama v2</strong>: The next iteration of our open-source large language model provided by Meta. It&#x27;s freely available for both research and commercial applications.</p>
<p><strong>File Uploader</strong>: A custom module designed to process each uploaded file in accordance with consensus requirements.</p>
<p>The architecture landscape of our design primarily consists of two core components: the Polkadot SDK for blockchain-related tasks and a suite of renowned open-source tools for distributed storage. These tools support extensive data processing, such as data structuring, model training, file management, and more.</p>
<p>We&#x27;ve chosen to delegate specific storage and data processing tasks to established open-source software. These tools have been in use for years and are widely recognized within the data science community.</p>
<p>In distributed storage, there are two main conceptual categories: nodes and clusters (networks of nodes that replicate all data across each node).</p>
<p>Each infrastructure provider will maintain a Hadoop cluster with associated services like Spark, Hive, or Llama v2 for data processing and model training. As mentioned earlier, they will also operate a substrate node responsible for block authoring.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="proxy">Proxy<a href="#proxy" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Proxy" title="Direct link to Proxy">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>To ensure that the infrastructure provider&#x27;s resources are used in line with the blockchain&#x27;s security and mechanisms, we&#x27;ll develop a proxy system. This system will serve as an interface, validating requests originating from signed transactions. Most of this proxy will depend on the cluster configuration, where system users are created from the user&#x27;s public key, and authentication is based on account signing. The current authentication system relies on the LDAP protocol, which allows for custom modules to extend the authentication mechanism. The high-level workflow for this custom module is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user provides their identifier (could be DN or another attribute).</li>
<li>The server generates a challenge and sends it to the user.</li>
<li>The user signs the challenge with their private key and returns the signature.</li>
<li>The server verifies the signature using the stored public key. If valid, the user is authenticated.</li>
</ol>
<p>No Stored Password: Traditional passwords will not be stored in the LDAP directory in this setup.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="custom-file-uploader-client-interface">Custom File Uploader (Client Interface)<a href="#custom-file-uploader-client-interface" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Custom File Uploader (Client Interface)" title="Direct link to Custom File Uploader (Client Interface)">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>After an agreement is reached between an infrastructure provider and a user, the user can begin uploading their files. During this upload, a custom user interface will segment the file into chunks, computing the hash for each segment.</p>
<p>This process will yield something like:</p>
<ul>
<li>File ID: 23 / parts: 4 / size: 240 GB.</li>
<li>Part ID: 1 / Hash:  662551bf52c62b...</li>
<li>Part ID: 2 / Hash:  347858cnqn21dn...</li>
<li>Part ID: 3 / Hash:  vfnq35gblajfrm...</li>
<li>Part ID: 4 / Hash:  3n5jq99vhtb3i9...</li>
</ul>
<p>Once the file is uploaded to the infrastructure provider, a transaction will be committed, registering this information with an &quot;unverified&quot; status.</p>
<p>From the infrastructure provider&#x27;s perspective, the same process will occur, ensuring that every hash for each part aligns with the values posted during the user&#x27;s previous transaction.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="consensus">Consensus<a href="#consensus" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Consensus" title="Direct link to Consensus">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>The chain will operate under the BABE and GRANDPA consensus mechanisms. We&#x27;ve chosen the BABE consensus not just for its security advantages over Aura but also because we plan to utilize the VRF (Verifiable Random Function) it generates. This randomness will be instrumental for processes like the Data Integrity Protocol, where a file segment is randomly selected for the cryptographic challenge detailed earlier.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-integrity-protocol">Data Integrity Protocol<a href="#data-integrity-protocol" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Integrity Protocol" title="Direct link to Data Integrity Protocol">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>To ensure that infrastructure providers maintain the agreed-upon storage with users, we will implement a data integrity protocol. This protocol will frequently verify, over a set number of blocks, that each infrastructure provider is storing and preserving the uploaded files.</p>
<p>A pallet responsible for this protocol will execute an off-chain worker (OCW) that randomly selects a file and a part from the infrastructure provider&#x27;s storage. It will then initiate the hashing calculation for that file/part in the off-chain worker. Once the computation concludes, the hash calculation result should match the value currently stored in the pallet storage. This check will occur as an unsigned transaction from the OCW. If there are 20 infrastructure providers, 20 unsigned transactions will be processed at regular intervals, meaning every a certain number of blocks.</p>
<p>It&#x27;s worth noting that the randomness value will be sourced from the VRF produced as part of the BABE block production mechanism.</p>
<p>While it may seem evident, it&#x27;s essential to note that checking the integrity of all files frequently is computationally intensive. By relying on random values that guide the file/part selection, we can probabilistically ensure that the infrastructure provider is storing the files previously uploaded by the user.</p>

These projects often interoperate with one another and frequently rely on external data to achieve their objectives. Our primary aim is to supply blockchain-validated, processed big data for various systems and applications that necessitate this kind of information.</p>
<p><strong>Target Audience</strong></p>
<p>While structured big data caters to a diverse range of users and applications, Deitos Network is specifically tailored to develop a system and user experience (UX) optimized for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Business Intelligence (BI) applications.</p>
<p><strong>Problem Statement</strong></p>
<p>The digital realm is witnessing an unprecedented surge in data, leading to challenges in hosting, structuring, analyzing, and processing this vast amount of information. Various entities, from businesses and governments to scientists and other professionals, are in dire need of this data for a plethora of applications. However, they often grapple with limitations in accessing and utilizing it effectively. The exponential growth of big data far outpaces our current capacity to process it, resulting in a vast reservoir of unstructured data that remains untapped for many potential applications. The intricate process of structuring and analyzing this data demands immense computational power, further constraining its effective use.</p>
<p>On the flip side, fostering a diverse ecosystem of big data storage, management, and processing providers can offer users solutions that are more attuned to their specific needs and requirements.</p>
<p><strong>Similar Projects in the Ecosystem</strong></p>
<p>In the realm of data storage and processing, two notable projects are making strides in the development of decentralized networks:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Subspace</strong>: This project is geared towards addressing the blockchain trilemma. Its primary feature revolves around the development of a Secure &amp; Sustainable Consensus, specifically the Proof-of-Archival-Storage (PoAS) consensus. Among its other salient features, it emphasizes full decentralization and composite scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Cess</strong>: Positioned as a Large-Scale Decentralized Cloud Data Solution, CESS&#x27;s Decentralized Cloud Network is fine-tuned for processing high-frequency dynamic data. It facilitates real-time data sharing while ensuring the protection of users&#x27; data ownership, privacy, and assets.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Arweave</strong>: A decentralized storage network designed to offer permanent data storage.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>While Deitos Network shares similarities with platforms such as Crust, Arweave, and IPFS, Deitos primary focus is distinct. The network emphasizes the processing, structuring, and utilization of data. The direction leans more towards Big Data and AI functionalities than acting as a descentralized storage service.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>DecentralML</strong>: A Polkadot protocol for decentralised federated machine learning and collective governance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Based on the grant information from <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/decentral_ml.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DecentralML</a>, it appears there are parallels in terms of decentralizing machine learning model training, where rewards are based on data model training contributions and parameter adjustments by governance.</p>
<p>Deitos approach, however, adopts a distinct architecture and game theory strategy. It focuses on infrastructure providers offering private services, competing to deliver optimal solutions to consumers. In future developments, these providers may also engage in maintaining and utilizing a shared public dataset, rewarded for hosting this data and processing consumer requests. (Section added from application&#x27;s feedback).</p>

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="grant-scope">Grant Scope<a href="#grant-scope" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Grant Scope" title="Direct link to Grant Scope">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>This grant is specifically earmarked for the foundational development of the network. Once the foundational elements, such as the substrate node and runtime, are established, the grant&#x27;s focus will shift towards the development of the Infrastructure Provider Management module, Proxy,the Data Integrity Protocol and the disputes mechanism. This can also be perceived as the mechanisms for authentication, data upload, and integrity verification.</p>
<p>Elements related to data consumption or querying, as well as the inclusion of other computational resources like vCPUs and RAM within the agreement, fall outside the purview of this grant. These aspects are slated for consideration in future development phases. Additionally, there are certain security implications associated with the Data Integrity Protocol and data consumption. Addressing these will necessitate advanced privacy measures, potentially involving zero-knowledge proofs.</p>
