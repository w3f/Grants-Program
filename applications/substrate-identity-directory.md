# Open Grant Proposal


* **Project Name:** Substrate Identity Hub
* **Team Name:** https://github.com/Shard-Labs
* **Payment Address:** 0x526F2bC9a5fc0839AD4956b06CB6dFf26F9503be
* **Status:** [Terminated](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/255#issuecomment-1014556219)

## Project Overview 
This application is in response to following RFP https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/identity-directory.md

### Overview

Identity Hub is a proposal of a fully client-side web application that would read and display registered identities on Substrate-based chains which implement the Identity pallet. By browsing a specific link, a user would be able to see beautifully rendered identity data of an on-chain identity along with all the metadata in the identity entry, an avatar if provided, and any verifications from the registrars on-chain. Users would be able to match and verify identities and also have access to sending tokens directly to another user.

GOALS:
Create a web service to query on-chain identities. The service accepts and reads input parameter as address and if the adddress exists create a single page view for a specific identity, if address doesn't exist stay on list page view.



### Project Details 
A web service would have a way of reading the following links:
https://identityhub.xyz/polkadot<identity>
https://identityhub.xyz/kusama<identity>
Web service would read the <identity> parameter and make a query to the corresponding chain and retrieve identity data of the requested identity. 
Web UI would have two ways of viewing data. A list view and a single page view. A list view would be a way for users to query the chain and display all registered identities on the Kusama and Polkadot chains. This view would be the default view if no specific identity is queried and provided in the URL. By clicking on the specific identity in the list, a user would be redirected to a single page view for the chosen identity. A single page view would be a way for users to query a specific identity data of the on-chain identity. This view would be a way for users to see identity activities indicative of a member’s reputation containing identity card of an on-chain identity along with all the metadata in the identity entry, an avatar if provided, any verifications from registrars in the chain, and buttons that allow you to send tokens directly to the user.

## Future Plans

After finishing milestones 1 and 2 users can utilize the basic application which supports querying by address, index or identity fields. Application has a list page and a single page view with a basic info column fully functional. Users will be able to set their own node endpoint.
There will be a follow-up for the project that would support a plug-in ecosystem for different sub-views of identities. On-line version would come with some default plug-ins deactivated and an off-line version would support simple installation of other plug-ins. Default plug-ins would be basic info, governance, treasury and validator, and optional plug-in would be transaction history, identity history, remark history and society plug-ins.
