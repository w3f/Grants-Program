## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
#### Dilemma of Web3 Ecosystem - Few Web3 applications regardless of rich abundant apps in Web2. Totally different technical stacks limit Web2 projects to transfer to Web3. It is very hard and time/economy-costing to develop pure Web3 DApps. 


![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/155807001-7050d842-d34b-490e-aa80-0cf5a9c4a929.png)



The SaaS3 project aims to deliver a fully decentralized software services network with highly scalable, crypto token incentivized and results in a solution that can patent and monetize Web2 projects to Web3 services. 
We present a solution: decentralized docker Runtime (dRuntime) for incentive miner nodes for maximum usage of idle resources and distributed software services for higher availability and security. 
This grant will allow us to develop several pallets to implement a parachain with substrate framework on Polkadot/Kusama. 
The SaaS3 can not only be used to decentralize computational providers but also used to mint patent-NFT to protect creator intellectual property.

SaaS3 as a part of Polkadot / Kusama / Web 3 Ecosystem and has Following Rich Properties:

  - Bridge - Patent and monetize abundant Web2 projects as decentralized Web3 software services in 10 minutes. 
  - Middlemanless - Extremely cheap fee for service users compare with centralized SaaS products.
  - Security - Improve the security for system by multiple layer consensus on Kusama/Polkadot relay chain.
  - Reliability - Strengthen robustness for service by dRuntime redundancy of miners.
  - Green - Save energy and reduce the service cost by making use of spare resource to mine.
  - Creator Economy - Protect intellectual properties by patent-NFT (pNFTs).

  
### Project Details

#### Architecture
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/155807055-cbb7a56d-1e0a-4202-8ceb-8892860b1a57.png)


Decentralized docker runtime (dRuntime) is the middleware between Web2 projects, computation power and Web3 services with three roles:

  - Users pay $SAAS to miners and creators to use Web3 software services. 

  - Miners earn 95% user-paid $SAAS to execute the software on their hardware. Each miner can run multiple software services. Miner services offering redundancy on blockchain delivers dRuntime to achieve decentralization for Web3

  - Creators earn 5% users-paid $SaaS as patent fee, since they are projects developers who write code to create softwares. 

Hint: Token Stakers share profits from miners by staking $SaaS to miners for DPoS (Delegation Poof-of-Stake). Net Rewards will be generated in 5 years to reward the active participants periodically including miners, users and creators, which follows bitcoin halving mechanism.

#### Components
  1. **Miner Network.**
  It is implemented by pallet-dRuntime and consists of all the computational power providers to offer decentralized Software as a Service which undertake to execute dDocker to reply DeResponse for user's DeRequest. All the dDockers are deployed by Creators on each miner. Thus, one miner is crashed other miners could follow up to replace the old one. This redundancy with sharding could guarantee the decentralized and robustness for SaaS3 network. 
  
  2. **Creator Network.**
  It is implemented by pallet-SaaS3DAO and is a DAO sub-project for Creators such as researchers and developers to submit their code and proposal to set up services through DAO mechanism which is a decentralized App with a UI website interface. Any creators can submit a proposal to set up APIs but, only DAO-approved proposals could finally be realized and accepted to deploy on all the miners. Therefore, DAO could make sure the quality and necessity for new API creations. Meanwhile, once a new dDocker is set up, a corresponding pNFT is minted and sent to creators address as a digital patent. The user's paid fee will send to pNFT holders. 
  
  3. **User Network.**
  It is implemented by pallet-user and consists of all the callable softwares in the application layer for users to send requests and retrieve the responses which also implements a DPoS consensus aside from Polkadot/Kusama to guarantee decentralization, venerable, and security. 
  
  4. **pNFT Mint.**
  It is implemented by pallet-pNFT. Any creators could mint tradable pNFTs as digital patents when they submit dDocker to dRuntime to earn API usage gains. The NFT mint will be implemented by pallet-softNFT and tradable on Singular and Kodadot marketplace.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Web2 project developers without Web3 technical stack knowledge to patent and monetize abundant projects as decentralized Web3 software services in 10 minutes.
- Using blockchain technology to construct a decentralized network to provide SaaS (Software as a Service) to replace centralized SaaS/API providers such as [Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureml/) and [Google AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai).  
We are devoted to building a decentralized SaaS in Web3 to combine millions of users, computational power providers with software creators in such a harmony way for offering extremely low costing and reliable services. SaaS3 aims to become the world largest decentralized SaaS platform based on Polkadot/Kusama to provide high-quality API services with extremely cheap prices.

| 1. | pallet-pNFT| The pNFT is implemented by pallet-pNFT and based on [RMRK core pallet](https://github.com/rmrk-team/rmrk-substrate/tree/main/pallets/rmrk-core) which is an extension of pallet-uniques. Thus, pallet-pNFT will be developed from pallet-rmrk-core and be an extension of it. In this milestone, all the pNFTs are PDF Patent files with pieces of code. Once the whole ecosystem is finished, the API earned fees from users will be sent to pNFT holders as patient fees. We will set up an NFT marketplace to trade those NFTs. For instance, the pNFTs could be sold and bought by everyone on the marketplaces such as [Singular](https://singular.rmrk.app), RMRK, and [Kodadot](https://kodadot.xyz). |
| 2. | pallet-user| This pallet mainly consists of two parts: user manager and application store. The first module implements user payment modes such as pay-as-you-go or subscription plan which sends earns to miners and creators. It also contains the requirements for a valid user such as token staking or reputation to prevent users from abusing the software/API. The application store contains the callable softwares in the application layer for users to send requests to miners and retrieve the responses based on a DPoS consensus on dRuntime beyond Polkadot/Kusama's native consensus to guarantee decentralization, endurance, and security. |
| 3. | Initial pNFT Offering | We will invite some notable AI scientists/developers to mint their typical academic research achievements as pNFTs on SaaS3 network as an NFT crowdsale. Those tradable NFTs will become functional as digital patents to earn patent fees for holders once the whole project is finished. |  
| 4. | UI & Frontend | This part is implemented by [substrate front-end template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) The frontend and UI of NFT mint and trade will be finished in this milestone. |
