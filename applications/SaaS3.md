## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
#### Dilemma of web3 Ecosystem - With functionalities yet to become full-fledged, Web3.0 applications need a rethink of development stacks. 
For instance, most of the web2 projects and dependencies are based on Java, C++, PHP, etc., while web3 requires another totally different technical stacks such as Solidity, Motoku, or Substrate on EVM / WASM which hinders web2 developers to build web3 applications. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/157393726-c22c47d2-a4d0-4335-b890-29d6fad4417c.png)


SaaS3 project aims to deliver a fully decentralized software as a service (SaaS) network with highly scalable, crypto token incentivized and results in a solution that can serve as the application interface (API) layer for web3. 
SaaS3 is devoted to transforming traditional web2 API to web3 dAPI by decentralized docker runtime (dRuntime). 
Particularly, regardless of development stack differences, Linux-based Web2 APIs can be deployed on our platform for providing web3 services by decentralized APIs (dAPI). 
Essentially, SaaS3 is an off-chain scaling technique of layer-2 which utilizes cheap off-chain docker computation to replace high-priced on-chain WASM / EVM runtime, while still remaining computation decentralization by delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus and on-chain zero knowledge proof. 
Therefore, such layer-2 off-chain scaling is not only for computation price but technical development stacks compatible. 
The SaaS3 project aims to decentralize computational providers and mint income-NFT to earn profits.
The API creators could earn an income fee by holding those iNFT or selling them on NFT marketplace.  
As a result, the SaaS3 project will bridge web2 APIs to web3 dAPIs to flourish web3 ecosystem and achieve creator economy in a decentralized and trust-minimized way. 
This grant will allow us to develop several pallets to implement a parachain with substrate on Polkadot / Kusama. 

SaaS3 as a part of Polkadot / Kusama / web 3 Ecosystem and has the following properties:

  - Bridge - Monetize abundant web2 projects as decentralized web3 services in a very short time with extremely cheap cost. 
  - No Middleman - Cheap fee for dAPI users or Dapp developers compare with centralized SaaS products.
  - Security - Improve the security for a system by PoS consensus and zero knowledge proof for miner network. Web3 dAPI are backed by token stakers (DPoS) with a reward and punishment mechanism.
  - Reliability - Strengthen robustness for dAPI by computation decentralization and dRuntime redundancy of miners.
  - Green - Save energy and reduce the cost by making use of spare computation resources for API computation.
  
### Protocol Details

#### Architecture

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/159788632-250f04b6-b2b9-42c5-9927-6e4487aea8ef.png)


Decentralized docker runtime (dRuntime) is built on miner network which aims to execute dAPIs. Those dAPIs is created by API creators as a result of development labor. Computational node targets to setup the dRuntime, or better known as the 'miner', namely the party that performs the computational tasks. They are hereafter referred to as 'nodes' or 'miners'. The Dapp developer is the dAPI user, who sends requests and pays to access the dAPI. Their actions are detailed below.

  - To access a web3 dAPI, users pay $SA3 tokens to nodes as the Gas fee and to software creators as the royalty fee. 

  - The node(s) are rewarded to execute dAPIs with dRuntime on their equipments. Importantly, each miner can run multiple dAPIs with dRuntime cache (dCache) to maximize the throughput.

  - The Creator receives the royalty fee as the reward for their commitment to the docker development; they are the author of Web2 API codes.

##### Security & Off-chain Miner Consensus 

- Miner security - To qualify, a miner or node is required to stake a particular amount of tokens as collateral (POS). Each request for API will trigger an on-chain zero-knowledge proof check (zkc), which determines whether the node is rewarded or punished. 

- API security - Similar to API3 insurance, API security is achieved via Delegation Proof of Staking (DPoS). Particularly, the API creator is required to stake an amount of tokens at the time of submitting the dAPI deployment. The amount is set at a default value in their first submission and is adjusted in proportion to the service income. Besides, the token holders are able to stake on the dAPIs as a collateral and share profits with API creator. The mechanism is established following the same vein of the concepts in Polkadot / Kusama, including staking, nomination, and validation.
 
The process described above establishes a de facto safeguard mechanism, sheltering dAPI users from potential malfunctions of the computational node or the API service, and when available providing remedies in compensation. 

##### Collateral and Sue Claims
In the case of a malfunction, the user detects the misperformance and assesses the damages and losses, and is able to lodge a sue claim published on the Court DAO. In supplement, the staked tokens or collaterals are 'locked' for a period, a mechanism to discourage stakers from 'front-running claims', i.e. withdrawing the staked token as soon as a miner or service malfunctions to evade claims. On the other hand, the litigant is required to stake funds to be able to make a claim, which elevates the cost of abuse. The Court DAO deliberates on the sue claim and decides whether a remedy should be made to the victimized dAPI user. Once a claim is passed in Court DAO, the amount of tokens as has been claimed will be transferred to the litigant in compensation. 

The same mechanism also applies to the punishment meted out for the node(s) that malfunctioned with on-chain zkc. Such a reward-and-punishment mechanism encourages nodes to act in good faith and better service quality. Hence, a much lower risk of potential cyber threats such as the Sybil attack.

#### Components

1. **Location Proof of Stake (LPoS) with zkc for Miners**
Regarding the miner network, we deploy on-chain zero knowledge check (zkc) and adopt a location-based optimization for PoS consensus, thus improving the network throughput for off-chain dRuntime execution. Specifically, when a dAPI user sends a request, a list of miner candidates will be generated, consisting of 10 nodes in the closest locations, (e.g., determined by network latency) which are determined by network latency. Meanwhile, since all nodes are required to have staked a amount of tokens, nodes are ranked in a list of, for example, 100 according to the staked amount. 3 miners has to be among the leading token stake and the ten nearest to qualify for executing the request and receiving the rewards, while the on-chain zero-knowledge check (zkc) is carried out. Admittedly, the network may to some degree hurt tolerable security. Nevertheless, the dAPI user will be able to access not just at low net-latency but also backed by the PoS consensus with zkc (for more about zkc, please refer to 7 or 9). It should also be noted that node congestion is mitigated en passant.

2. **dRuntime**
dRuntime refers to a decentralized docker runtime which execute dAPIs in a network of distributed computing resources. It is essentially an off-chain technique to scaling up computation for on-chain runtime, such as WASM or EVM in Polkadot or Ethereum networks. 

3. **dCache**
dRuntime cache is a 3-level caching mechanism to guarantee high performance and large throughput for dRuntime.  

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/157394601-8a6d1bd4-cefa-4dc9-b4c4-d85098fda6d8.jpg" width="512">

4. **SaaSDAO**
SaaSDAO refers to the decentralized autonomous organization charged with governance duties.
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/159328187-2b0104df-9e53-4000-b4bc-a122adc97fbf.png" width="512">

5. **iNFT** 
iNFT refers to a tradable income NFT that is minted when an API creator submits a docker image to create a dAPI. iNFT allows the API creator to earn royalty fee.

6. **Miner Network**
The miner network is implemented by pallet-miner and consists of all the providers of computational capabilities. The network offer decentralized APIs which undertakes to execute containers to reply DeResponse for user's DeRequest. All docker images can be deployed on each miner. Thus, other nodes are called in replacement should any node break down. The 'redundancy' of computing nodes, which is at the miner-level, helps the SaaS3 maintain its decentralization features and remain robust.

7. **On-chain 3-person zero knowledge proof check (3-zkc) and rewards** 
Each dAPI call will be executed by 3 miners. Therefore, the hash values generated following the three responses will be compared against each other for agreement. The 3-zkc is performed enabled by a callable, on-chain pallet-function. There are multiple scenarios, as follows.
   - The three hash values are in agreement. No one will being slashed.
   - Only two values are in agreement, the check still gains approval. Another miner is found inconsistent and will be slashed on its token stake.
   - There is no agreement among the three nodes. In this case, the API call returns failure. The gas fee is nonetheless consumed and has no refunds. No party will face slash or claim reward, as neither miner malfunctions nor dAPI bugs can be found attributable. However, the failure-logs are recorded on on-chain storage. The user could raise an issue to the creator to push for a new docker, or lodge a sue claim on Court DAO as a query for potential compensation from miners / creators. For more details, please refer to 9. 3-zkcg.

8. **Court DAO**
At Court DAO, the dAPI user can pay a fee for sue claims and, subject to the court's ruling, may claim compensation from miners / creators on SaaS3 DAO on grounds of any dAPI failure. To supplement the on-chain failure logs, the user is required to provide the details regarding the failure case, such as the input data and the version of the failed API (docker image version). The Jury consists of top 101 largest staked API creators who are open source developers and active on DAO events. Members of the Jury can download the same version docker image and retest the failure case to investigate the failure cause. The on-chain failure log is available for jury members. 

    Jury will have the following options given the on-chain log records and local test results.

    - Reject - The user's sue claim is rejected, with no compensation, and the sue fee will not be refunded. Such a ruling may be on the grounds such as forged evidence and unreasonable amount of claims. Terms and conditions and regulations of SaaSDAO apply.
    - Approve
      - Miner malfunction: 
        - Which miners should be slashed. (This is multiple choices refer to on-chain log):
          - Miner1, Miner2, or Miner3
      - Slash the dAPI in terms of drawbacks or bugs.
      

9. **3-zkc and gas calculation algorithm (3-zkcg)**

We will provide a protocol / software which is similar with [AWS Lambda API Pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/pricing/) for miner, but replace dollar unit with gas. In SaaS3, miners should monitor each container's resource usage by our software to calculate gas usage i.e., `gas_used` for once dAPI call. `rewards=gas_used*gas_price` gas_used is defined by following process with 3-zkc. Here, we illustrate the algorithm to show the procedure, a user request with `gas_limit` is sent to three miners `m1,m2,m3` at time `t=0` with user-set maximum timeout `Tmax`, there will be following scenarios: 
 - If after timeout `Tmax`, no response is received, go to the failure state.
 - Else, got `m1` response `r1` with reported gas `g1` at time `t1`, reset timeout `Tmax=max(2*t1, Tmax)`.
   - If after timeout `Tmax`, go to failure state.
   - Else, got `m2` response `r2` with reported gas `g2` at time `t2`, zkc will be conducted to confirm whether `r1=r2`
     - `r1=r2` return `r1` to user and distribute `rewards=min(g1,g2) * gas_price` to `m1` with `(1-g1/(g1+g2)) * rewards` and to `m2` with `(1-g2/(g1+g2))*rewards` which means the lower `gas report`, the more rewards. 
     - `r1!=r2` reset timeout `Tmax=max(2*t2, Tmax)`
       - If after timeout `Tmax`, go to failure state.
       - Else, got `m3` response `r3` with reported gas `g3` at time `t3`, zkc will be conducted to confirm whether `r3=r1` or `r3=r2`
         - If `r1!=r2!=r3`, go to failure state.
         - Else, two conditions
           - `r3=r1`, return `r1` to user and distribute `rewards=min(g1, g3) * gas_price` to `m1` with `(1-g1/(g1+g3)) * rewards` and to `m3` with `(1-g3/(g1+g3))*rewards`. `m2` will be slashed.
           - `r3=r2`, return `r2` to user and distribute `rewards=min(g2, g3) * gas_price` to `m2` with `(1-g2/(g2+g3)) * rewards` and to `m3` with `(1-g3/(g2+g3))*rewards`. `m1` will be slashed.
 - Failure state: reply user `error: dAPI fail` and charge gas fee as `gas_mean * gas_price`, where `gas_mean` is the average gas for that dAPI in the history. Neither three miners will be slashed, since in such case, it hard to determine whether the dAPI has bugs. The user could raise an issue/sue to Creator/CourtDAO to acquire compensation based on above on-chain records. If the miners notice some weird slashes with on-chain evidence, miners could raise sue to CourtDAO with their proof (e.g., give an IPFS docker image path which is the same version as creator submitted) to acquire claims and slash dAPI with acceptance from Court DAO.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Although web2 applications are highly dependent on centralized libraries and technical stack, they have a potential case of monetization if migrated to web3 as decentralized web3 dAPI through SaaS3 protocol.
- SaaS3 cloud could be a competitive alternative to centralized SaaS / API providers such as [Salesforce](https://appexchange.salesforce.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/azureml/) and [Google AI](https://cloud.google.com/products/ai).  
- SaaS3 brings millions of dAPI/Dapp users, providers of computing resources and users into a harmony and an organic ecosystem, with lowered costs and reliable services. SaaS3 aims to become the world's largest decentralized API platform based on Polkadot / Kusama to provide high-quality dAPIs / Dapps at extremely affordable prices.
- SaaS holds potential for interaction with other parachains of Polkadot / Kusama. SaaS3's dAPIs can also be utilized as computation services for other parachain's specific usage such as AI-related recognition or game-AI algorithms.
