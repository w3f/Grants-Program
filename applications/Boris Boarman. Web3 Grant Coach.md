## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Web3 space is well-known for fostering innovation, and existing crypto grant programs and funding options have given birth to many promising startups and initiatives.

However,

- the process of searching for, finding, and applying for the right crypto funding option is cumbersome and time-consuming for both applicants and reviewers.
- Applicants struggle with identifying suitable grants and preparing high-quality applications,
- while reviewers face the challenge of managing numerous submissions.
- To our research about 85% of proposals get rejections either because of irrelevance, poor quality, however reviewer's lack of domain competence and even nepotism among foundations members are among the most common reasons as well. 
- [This inefficiency](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384437723_State_of_Web3_Grants_Report_2024) leads to missed funding opportunities for promising projects and teams
- and increased workloads for grant reviewers.

Solution: Boris Boarman - AI-agentic application streamlining the grant application and review process by 100 folds.

Use case 1: Idea Review and Evaluation
A proposal is checked against the knowledge base (RAG apppication) of all previous applications and tested by a trained LLM or real AI intellegence capable of evaluating an idea based on a numeric impact analysis approach and real market data. Feedback for improvement is provided, so a proposal can reach the scoring theashold and be eligable for funding. 

Use case 2: Relevant Grant Programs 
The AI assistant selects the best relevant and currently active funding options to finance the development of the project or initiative, reducing the efforts from days to minutes. 

Use case 3: Automated proposal generation
The AI assistant guides the user through a sequence of questions to collect enough information about the project and generates application documents (including the application form and project development calculation) following a foundation’s application structure and guidance.

- On-chain project scoring and funds management
- Many more.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The project enhances the grant funding process by introducing an automated scoring system for evaluating proposals. It aligns with the ecosystem's goals of decentralized innovation by enabling transparent, data-driven decision-making for foundation grants.
As Polkadot and Kusama rely on community-driven development, the tool can serve treasuries, parachains, and DAOs, streamlining the funding pipeline for projects contributing to the ecosystem.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Both grant applicants (clear criteria and faster response times) and ecosystem managers (reduced administrative overhead). 

- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
"Communicating effectiveness is crucial for community support:
- There’s a strong focus on making the review process clear and involving the community in decision-making. By setting up structured timelines, using clear criteria, and including both insiders and community members in reviews, programs build trust and make sure the projects they fund are truly in line with what the ecosystem needs." [State of Web3 Grants]https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384437723_State_of_Web3_Grants_Report_2024)

"Many community-powered grant programs, which are based on token-holding, are still subject to issues with plutocracy and favoritism, as well as sybil attacks, and there’s a shift happening to either improving the horizontal distribution of the funding (introducing Quadratic Matching), or more expert driven, and thus more objective decision making (Neural Quorum Governance)." [State of Web3 Grants](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/384437723_State_of_Web3_Grants_Report_2024)

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

Gitcoin (for Polkadot):
Similarity: Focuses on grant funding but relies on community voting.
Difference: Boris Boarman automates scoring using AI reducing reliance on subjective voting.

Polkadot Treasury Proposal System:
Similarity: Evaluates funding proposals for ecosystem development. AI-generated summary helps to understand the essence of a proposal, but not the details which are essencial to evaluate.
Difference: Boris Boarman AI scores ideas/proposals by 7 parameters and helps to identify or/and fomulate real value to ecosystem.

Boris Boarman:
Combines AI-powered proposal writing, data validation and automated unbiased scoring reduce builders efforts on application and grant program managers and reviewers overhead to ensure fund usage aligns with programs objectives.
