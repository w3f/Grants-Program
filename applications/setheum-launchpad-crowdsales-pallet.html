The HighEnd LaunchPad Protocol lets teams/projects/campaigns achieve two (2) major goals at once, it raises money, and and sell their tokens to the public.
The protocol uses <code>MultiCurrency</code> to let the Campaign Creator choose which currency to raise/sell their tokens for. Therefore,  Campaign Creator can choose to raise funds in any currency available on the chain.</p><p>There is a <code>goal</code> that is set by the Campaign Creator, the beneficiary of the fund and the Period (campaign period - amount of blocks a campaign should stay active) of the campaign and other information that describes the campaign.</p><p><strong>The Lifecycle of a Campaign</strong></p><p>A Launchpad Campaign has three stages in its lifecycle, they are as follows:</p><ol><li><p><strong>Pre-Funding/Proposal Stage</strong>: The Campaign Creator creates the campaign and sets the Period/TimeCap and HardCap. In this stage, the Campaign Creator must submit the proposal to the Governance Council along with a <code>SubmissionDeposit</code> required by the protocol.</p></li><li><p><strong>Waiting Stage</strong>: The Campaign waits for the appropriate time to start the Campaign. The Protocol has a <code>WaitingPeriod</code> that is set on runtime, and all campaigns have to wait for that period to start.</p></li><li><p><strong>Funding/Active Stage</strong>: The Campaign can raise funds and sell their tokens to the public in this stage. If the <code>goal</code> is reached before the <code>period</code> to end the campaign, the campaign will be ended and the funds will be available for the public to claim and the raised funds for the Campaign Beneficiary or Creator to claim.</p></li></ol><p><strong>Campaign Ctegories</strong></p><p><strong>A Successful Launchpad Campaign</strong></p><p>A successful Launchpad Campaign is one that has raised the <code>goal</code> and has sold their tokens to the public. Once the <code>goal</code> is reached, the Campaign is considered successful.</p><p><strong>A Failed Launchpad Campaign</strong></p><p>A failed Launchpad Campaign is one that has not raised the <code>goal</code> and has not sold their tokens to the public. Once the <code>goal</code> is not reached and the <code>period</code> to end the campaign has ended, the Campaign is considered failed and the campaign allocation of tokens is available for the Campaign Creator to claim refund and the raised funds are also available for the Crowd/Contributors/buyers to claim refunds all only before the <code>RetirementPeriod</code> of the campaign.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="prior-work">Prior work<a href="#prior-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Prior work" title="Direct link to Prior work">​</a></h4><p>The initial implementation of the project which was intended as a deliverable for this grant was initiated a few days ago and made sure that the project was working as expected, before the application is to be submitted to the Grants Program to avoid large design &amp; implementation ammendments during the grant deliverance.
We are working on the <a href="https://github.com/Setheum-Labs/Setheum" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Setheum node Implementation</a>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technology-stack">Technology Stack<a href="#technology-stack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technology Stack" title="Direct link to Technology Stack">​</a></h4><p>The substrate pallet is written in rust based on the <code>FRAME</code> Substrate framework. The pallet types in <code>types.json</code> are generated in <code>JSON</code>, and the Test Node will be a fork of the <code>Setheum Node</code> based on the <code>substrate-node-template</code>, the node leverages the <code>ORML</code> stack for a lot of functionalities especially <code>Multi-Currency</code> functionalities. And the GUI to be used in the tutorial is a custom <code>React.JS</code> app utilising <code>Polkadot.JS</code>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="non-goals">Non-Goals<a href="#non-goals" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Non-Goals" title="Direct link to Non-Goals">​</a></h4><p>I muat be very clear that we are not intending to implement the Setheum HighEnd LaunchPad Proocol as is described in our Whitepaper. Rather, this is only a stepping stone towards those goals. This will only implement a simple launchpad crowdsales substrate pallet. While we intend to implement this protocol in Setheum, it is not yet ready for production and might currently have unknown issues, therefore this does not represent the final state of what is intended to go into production on our main chain implementation, and we do not intend the current implementation to have the robust functionalities of a production-level launchpad platform. This will instead only result in an initial test network for evaluation purposes.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><ul><li>Our project fits in the DEFi chain realm of the ecosystem.</li><li>Our target audience is DeFI, and bridging Parachain;</li><li>It meets the needs of Ethical DeFi governed as Shari&#x27;ah Compliant DeFi Blockchain.</li><li>There are other projects similar to Setheum in the substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, like Acala that supports DeFi and there is the FRAME simple-crowdfund pallet that is a part of Substrate FRAME providing a simple crowdfunding mechanism, our pallet provide crowdsales mechanisms. But as for the Halal Ethical DeFi governed as Shari&#x27;ah Compliant DeFi, I have not come across similar projects in the ecosystem.
Setheum is different in its core governance principle such that it serves as a Halal Ethical DeFi governed as Shari&#x27;ah Compliant DeFi network. And it has plans for embedded on-chain Flashloans running in an on-chain <code>Flashloans-Virtual-Machine</code> similar to the EVM (but not turin complete) just for executing isolated flashloan transactions. We also differ in the Stablecoin stability mechanism in Setheum, which is an elastic Algorithmic-Stablecoin-Stability mechanism provided by the SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol). We also differ in that we have 2 stablecoins and 4 other tokens which all serves a different purpose in the ecosystem.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Muhammad-Jibril B.A.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Muhammad-Jibril B.A.</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:jbashir52@gmail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jbashir52@gmail.com</a></li><li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://setheum.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://setheum.xyz</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><p>Not set up yet.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>I am building the Setheum Network project and all related code works in the organisation.
