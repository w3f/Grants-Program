# ISO20022 Ecosystem Research and Technical Design

- **Team Name:** Solidbit GmbH

- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1


## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

This proposal is a response to [this RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/ISO_20022.md).


ISO20022 is the future standard of financial transactions of all kinds including payments, foreign exchange and securities trading. Many blockchain ecosystems like [Ripple](https://ripple.com/), [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) and [Stellar](https://stellar.org/) are already ISO20022 compliant. In order to make Polkadot ISO20022 compatible as well, it is necessary to start designing how such an integration would look like in pratice.

### Project Details

If Polkadot wants to become compatible with the traditional finance industry, an ISO20022 integration will be the right place to start.
The goal of this project is to get an overview of how other blockchain ecosystems approach the ISO20022 integration, outline challenges and opportunities of such an integration and provide technical designs of how Polkadot could become ISO20022 compatible.
