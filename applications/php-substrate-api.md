# W3F Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** php substrate api
* **Team Name:** Nitor Infotech
* **Payment Address:** We are doing this free to contribute to Blockchain community
* **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1 

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/php-api.md

### Overview

* PHP Substrate RPC api lib
* lib for using the substrate RPC end points.
* As a team we are already working on blockchain. We are already contributing in Hyperledger and ethereum. This is our steps to get involved in polkadot using substrate lib. We have already integrated the RPC endpoints and working on it's function of balance transfer as an example to demonstrate.

### Project Details

Substrate RCP end points are implemented in Go, Ruby, Python, C++ etc. We are adding one more language to the fold by implementing the APIs in PHP. They can be used in any PHP application by composer installation. We have followed PSR-4 conding standard as coding standard for development.

This project will help to avail substrate features in applications/platforms build using PHP language.

## Development Status :open_book:

For implementing the library class to make RPC endpoint call is being created. Work on initialisation of properties and methids is going on. Deliverables as comply to rfp are in progress.

* https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/php-api.md,

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

A class which can be instantiated in an application to use endpoints
```php
$testClass = new SubstrateInterface("http_url");
echo $testClass->rpc->system->name();
```

once RPC endpoints are consumed package it and make it usable for other applications to integrate it.
```bash
composer require neha0921/substrate-interface-package
```

## Future Plans

* Substrate is continuasly changin, to support it's functionality and working with changes, we are planning to provide lifetime support. 
* We are workging on Blockchain as well, so we want to be involved in it's development with multichain connectivity and future development.
* With this we are involved in rust development as well. In future looking to work on development/issue fixing of Substrate.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** We got a suggestion of Gautam from parity about start with some grant

* We have already build a lib for invoking the RPC endpoints. 
* We have implemented some RPC endpoints as well.
