## Overview

### Introduction

Over billions of dollars of digital collectibles (NFTs) have been minted and traded. The people minting these tokens need to know who's interacting, buying, selling, and how they should best create them. They also need to know what different variations of digital collectibles have gamification or point elements that are attached to these assets and how users are receptive to this. With this information at hand, they can get faster and more effective feedback so they can make artful or functional digital collectibles that drive the right behaviors for that model. In the traditional space, companies have access to tools such as Segment and Google Analytics, that have become commonplace due to opportunity cost and user retention. We plan on bringing that functionality into the blockchain space.

### Project Details

The NFT Product Analytics Suite will aggregate various data points both off and on chain to provide NFT minters the metrics they need to use to decide how to best serve their target audience. This will include tracking the transfers of the user's minted NFTs, when and how much they are being sold for, and price trends. We will also aggregate the meta data associated with a given NFT to see the effectiveness of various gamification methods. With this data being tracked, you will be able to compare your NFTs to other leading projects and artists to see what the difference is and how to better target end users.

## Ecosystem Fit

Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem? / What need(s) does your project meet?

- With the largely growing adoption of NFTs, whether you are a game company or an NFT artist, a major pain point is the lack of easy access to metrics that are standard in other non-blockchain-based ecosystems. Those metrics have proved detrimental in how people decide to best present their offering to their target audience, but have remained largely out of reach for a large portion of the early adopters in the NFT space either due to time or technical experience. NFT artists and content creators will be able to track their progress, spot trends, and better tell what their customers want without getting lost in technical documentation or spending time manually collecting data. Companies won't have to devote time or development resources to come up with an in-house monitoring solution to track revenue, user adoption, and easily compare new ideas.

Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

- In-house
- Blockchain companies and NFT-based Solutions
- NFT artists and content creators

Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

- There are projects that index the chain, but none that are specifically tracking metrics that are related to NFTs both on and off chain

## Future Plans

---

Here at Health Hero we have been focusing on providing an instant health engagement platform for employees, patients, and community members, but have always been at the convergence of health engagement and gamification. We saw an opportunity in applying gamification to well-being and released a well-being driven digital collectible game. With the analytics suite we will be able to better determine what we can do to drive user retention and engagement within our platform while at the same time providing incentives for our user's well being.

## Additional Information

We became aware of the Web-3 grants after our partnership with the Enjin team, which suggested that we should get in touch with the Web-3 Foundation. After discussing our main project with the team, they put us in touch with David Hawig given his previous experience in the healthcare space who then specifically went into the details regarding the grants and other types of support they can offer.
