## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The Interoperable State Machine Protocol, or ISMP for short, is the product of our [research](https://research.polytope.technology/state-(machine)-proofs) into state proofs. We show that state-proof based interoperability is possible and more efficient as the messages no longer need to be routed through the relay chain and can be exchanged independent of it, while still maintaining the same level of trustlessness and security. This protocol allows not just for messaging but also [state reads of other parachains](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/issues/5087) in a trustless and secure manner.

Unfortunately, Parachain-to-Parachain communication today relies on the relay chain for message routing. This is highly inefficient and relieving the relay chain of this burden will allow for better Parachain throughput and scalability. We believe ISMP is the end-game for parachain interoperability, with the relevant ISMP modules, each parachain can send and receive messages and assets to and from other parachains which also have the ISMP modules.

## Project Details

ISMP is a simple protocol for state machines to send requests that can be handled by a counterparty chain. Akin to the HTTP paradigm in web2, parachains can issue GET-like requests for storage reads as well as POST-like requests for sending data.

Requests are stored in a [merkle mountain range tree](https://research.polytope.technology/merkle-mountain-range-multi-proofs) on the sending chain as this data structure provides some benefits, binary merkle trees have more compact proof sizes than patricia merkle tries, and in particular, merkle mountain range trees have much smaller proof sizes for recently inserted items in the tree. We believe this choice will enable higher bandwidth parachain &lt;&gt; parachain messaging with smaller proof sizes.

ISMP will also support request timeouts, allowing for more safer parachain &lt;&gt; parachain messaging.

### Use cases

For instance a user wanting to transfer their funds from parachain A to parachain B will initiate a post request on parachain A. This post request is stored in an mmr maintained in the state trie on parachain A. Parachain A's headers also contain the root for this mmr structure.

The user('s wallet) after observing that parachain A's headers have been finalized and made it's way into the relay chain state trie, can present a merkle proof of parachain A's header in the relay chain state trie which parachain B can verify using it's access to the latest relay chain state root. Next they present the mmr proof for the request which they had previously initiated on parachain A. After verifying this mmr proof, parachain B can "execute" the request. In this case minting the equivalent asset that was burnt on parachain A.

There are of course other use cases that can be built on POST requests, but this is the simplest case.

For GET requests, a different mechanism is at play. Perhaps a user wants to settle a bet they had made in a prediction market in parachain A. The data that is needed to settle this bet is on parachain B where we regard parachain B as the oracle parachain. The user initiates a GET request, with it's content the keys of the storage items they need to settle their bet. After initiating the request, the request is stored in the parachain A's mmr trie, but it is never relayed anywhere. Instead, the user('s wallet) then reads the state trie of parachain B and provides the state proof for the appropriate data that was requested.


### **`pallet-ismp`**

This serves as the foundational element for state-proof based messaging between parachains, enabling state reads of the relay chain directly from any given parachain, granting the ability to verify incoming messages and data from other parachains under the shared security umbrella of the relay chain.

**Custom crates**

- `ismp-rs` - A set of primitives necessary for pallet-ismp
  - `ISMPHost`: Represents a state machine's core functionality
  - `ISMPRouter`: Embodies the request and response routing logic for parachain interactions
  - `ConsensusClient`: Logic for consensus proof verification

This module can also serve as an alternative transport layer for XCM programs.

### Ecosystem Fit

Currently messages are sent over the Relay Chain through opening HRMP channels but through ISMP we can increase the bandwidth of messaging between parachains without burdening the relay chain with these messages. This allows the relay chain to focus on its main task: enforcing the validity of parachain state transitions.
