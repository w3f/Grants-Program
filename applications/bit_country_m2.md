- **Project:** Bit.Country Milestone 2 (Follow up grant after M1 delivered) by MVP.STUDIO
- **Proposer:** https://github.com/bit-country
- **Payment Address:** bc1q8754c69ldnd4w7jwucv4hfyr2kvefxdqcuztge

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Changes summary

There are some changes from the original [application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/305). The reason of the changes that some UI features that was not aligned on our roadmap and we shifted more focus on delivering public testnet and canary network.

Here are summary of changes

- Remove 3D map and continuum UI out of the application scope.
- Adjusted Continuum Governance Protocol.
- Added Buying Continuum Spot with fixed cost.
- Added Sign to support NFT.
- Added Multi tokens local marketplace.
- Added Benchmarking.
- Adjusted the cost.
- Adjust the FTE.

### Summary

Since completing the first milestone for Bit.Country, we have developed multiple proof of concepts for newer features such as Continuum (the map of bit countries), the marketplaces and NFT minting.

We have also developed the virtual world further, implementing collaborative building, material packs, persistance of changes and general tweaks to the UI and experience. Currently undergoing basic user testing and demoing to interested parties.

Other work has included changes to the design and layout of the DApp; improved sharing experience for posts and content created on the bit country timelines; migration to improve scalability.

The team has also been applying for a number of accelerators, and receiving attention/interest from multiple VCs, funds and KOLs. Currently, oversubscribed so negotiating with them to determine the initial round allocations. The team has recently been accepted into the Berkeley Blockchain Xcelerator cohort of 2021. Currently in talks with VCs, funds and KOLs who have reach to over 40 million fans. If you are interested to hear more about our current progress, please email us at hi@bit.country

### Considerations

We have been investigating the possibility of using decentralized storage for more aspects of bit country content and storage needs, a basic proof of concept is being worked on.

The team has been reconsidering the block planner for a bit country and its related block theme feature as part of milestone 1. We are now looking at separating the logic to enable a smoother experience between users who wish to use a predesigned template or build from scratch.
