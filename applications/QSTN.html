<li>QSTN is a Web3 survey marketplace where businesses fund surveys, reward participants, and uphold user privacy through our data wallet-driven profiles.</li>
<li>QSTN is a cutting-edge platform that combines AI-driven surveys with a secure data wallet. Our solution empowers users to earn digital rewards from surveys while maintaining privacy. We&#x27;re revolutionizing data monetization in the digital age.</li>
</ul>
<p>At QSTN, we aim to revolutionize the data collection landscape by addressing key challenges faced by traditional survey platforms. We understand that user engagement is essential for successful data collection, which is why we offer a gamified experience to incentivize users and boost response rates. Through our platform, businesses can easily fund surveys using digital tokens or NFTs, streamlining payment processes and ensuring faster and more efficient transactions.</p>
<p>One of the most significant concerns in data collection is data privacy and security. We prioritize user trust and confidence by providing our data wallet, Cubby, which allows users to maintain full control over their data. This secure environment ensures that users&#x27; personal information remains private, making them more willing to share valuable insights. Additionally, we equip businesses with AI-assisted survey creation and advanced data analytics tools, enabling them to derive meaningful insights from survey responses and make data-driven decisions. Our strategic partnerships with prominent blockchain projects like NEAR and Stellar further enhance our platform&#x27;s capabilities and foster interoperability within the Web3 ecosystem. Through these solutions, we aim to create a compelling and user-centric data collection platform that empowers businesses and individuals alike.</p>

<ul>
<li>Building on this, we would like Polkadot to be the next blockchain we implement; allowing its users to answer questionnaires, earn DOT rewards and mint NFTs upon completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>The key to our platform is allowing users to monetize their personal information in a low gas, scalable environment and Polkadot meets both of these requirements. By supporting this initiative, the Web3 Foundation is investing in data infrastructure for the entire DOT ecosystem as well as creating a new “Play-to-Earn” model for data aggregation.</p>
<p>For scope, QSTN can be broken down into two different user experiences:</p>
<ol>
<li>User experience - users create an account and then have the ability to complete 3 daily surveys in return for DOT tokens and NFTs</li>
<li>Business experience - businesses create an account and build their own survey, rewarding users for their participation in DOT tokens and NFTs</li>
</ol>
<p>We want to bring both experiences to the DOT ecosystem and allow businesses to fund, track and engage users via their own surveys with the assistance of AI.</p>

<li>QSTN is an innovative Web3 survey platform that combines blockchain, gamification, and AI to revolutionize data collection. Businesses can easily fund surveys using digital tokens or NFTs, offering users enticing rewards for their participation. Our data wallet, Cubby, ensures users maintain full control over their data, ensuring privacy and security.</li>
</ul>
<p>To ensure this vision becomes a reality, we&#x27;re harnessing the power of Safe&#x27;s decentralized custody protocol and collective asset management platform. Users signing up on QSTN have their email addresses utilized to create individualized Safe vaults, powered by Web3 authentication. This integration enables users to complete surveys, earn zero-knowledge proofs, and subsequently claim their rewards directly within their EVM wallet.</p>
<p>SAFE is a non-custodial solution by Consensys (<a href="https://safe.global/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://safe.global/</a>), it facilitates wallet creation utilizing email addresses. Currently, SAFE lacks support for Polkadot. Given this, we will enable users to interact directly with the pallet, easing the reward redemption process post-survey completion. The wallet we will use is Polkadot JS wallet.</p>
<p>We aim to take advantage of the low gas, scalable environment offered on DOT to allow users to earn DOT, mint NFTs and transfer assets without exorbitant transactional fees.</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now, our target audience can be broken down in the following groups:</li>
</ul>
<p>A. Agencies</p>
<ul>
<li>Marketing agencies</li>
</ul>
<p>*Target agencies to use for experiential campaigns + source to relevant clients</p>
<p>B. Brands</p>
<ul>
<li>Airline</li>
<li>Beauty brands</li>
<li>Food delivery</li>
<li>Record labels</li>
</ul>
<p>*Target customer experience, customer success and marketing team</p>
<p>C. Educational institutions</p>
<ul>
<li>Colleges</li>
<li>Universities</li>
</ul>
<p>*Target professors, teachers and researchers</p>
<p>D. Web3</p>
<ul>
<li>Analytics firms - Addressable, Chainalysis, Dune Analytics, Kaiko, Messari, Nansen, Pantera Capital, QuickNode, Solidus Labs</li>
<li>DAOs</li>
<li>Foundations</li>
<li>NFT communities</li>
<li>Exchanges</li>
</ul>
<p>*Target marketing, community outreach and developer support</p>
<p>Here are some notable milestones we&#x27;ve achieved since inception:</p>
<ol>
<li>Secured a position in Outlier Venture&#x27;s NEAR Base Camp, successfully closing our pre-seed round.</li>
<li>Developed a data wallet feature, now generating zero-knowledge proofs upon survey completion.</li>
<li>Integrated AI to assist businesses in crafting surveys and evaluating authenticity of responses through a &quot;credibility&quot; score.</li>
<li>Garnered preliminary interest from notable entities like NYU, Estée Lauder, and L&#x27;Oréal for potential test partnerships, in collaboration with the NEAR Foundation.</li>
<li>Were honored with acceptance into the Polkadot Blockchain Academy, although a visit was precluded due to visa constraints.</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Our platform is able to act as a Web3 on-ramp because our design easily onboards novice, less experienced internet users. This is important because in our initial feedback, we learned a lot of internet users want to get into blockchain but do not have the capital, resources or know where to start.</li>
</ul>
<p>We were inspired by the Pi app, as well as Sweatcoin which are two “Play-to-Earn” models where users get rewarded for daily, micro tasks based on actions taken in-platform.</p>
<p>QSTN builds on their concept by offering more exciting, engaging rewards, increasing the educational value behind our mission statement as well as creating a cohesive community for participants in our network (e.g. NFTs, metaverse).</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are currently no other projects similar to ours in the Substrate ecosystem. However, we do see a potential partnership with Ocean Protocol as we can sell and aggregate our data profiles within their primary market.</p>
<ul>
<li>There are no other Web3 data market research portals but similar Web2 solutions include Google Form, Nielsen and Survey Monkey; the problem is these agencies do not have blockchain infrastructure currently in place.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Our unique offering is the ability for Web2 users to answer questions, earn credits and buy NFTs within a &quot;gas-less&quot; environment but having the option to connect their wallet and mint once familiar with the technology.</p>
<p>We spent the past year participating in over 7 accelerators to help drive the brand awareness within the Web3 space and ensure we become the &quot;go-to&quot; market research portal in blockchain.</p>
<ul>
<li>There has been an increase in the “Play-to-Earn” model and a couple players who are making noise in the space would include Rabbit Hole (educational), NEAR Crowd (micro task), Axie Infinity (gaming), Pi (validation), and Sweat Coin (exercise).</li>
</ul>
<p>We see a market opportunity to use this model for data aggregation, gamifying marketing research and then selling this information to corporate sponsors who offer digital goods or discounts to our users.</p>

<ul>
<li>As QSTN, our major product milestones for the next 6 months include:</li>
</ul>
<ol>
<li>Developing the Cubby Data Wallet, which will replace user profiles, enabling users to authorize data requests directly from a Chrome extension wallet. This feature enhances user control over their data and streamlines the authorization process.</li>
<li>Creating the Cubby File Storing Platform, a decentralized storage solution powered by Filecoin. Users and businesses can securely store their files, with the owner holding the only decryption key, ensuring privacy and exclusive access.</li>
<li>Collaborating with NYU, L&#x27;Oréal, and Estée Lauder to test and refine our platform by incentivizing their respective communities, helping us gather valuable insights and optimize our offerings.</li>
<li>Expanding our clientele beyond web3 startups to include larger legacy brands and marketing agencies. Our goal is to establish QSTN as the &quot;go-to&quot; self-service marketing tool for a diverse range of businesses seeking innovative and effective solutions.</li>
