# Silent Base Project Grant Proposal

- **Team Name:** Silent Base Team
- **Payment Details:**
  - **USDC (Ethereum):** 0x6cB895e802E59d90A445B573307509Ea334189Cf
- **Level:** 1

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- **Silent Base** is a decentralized orderbook protocol on Ethereum Layer 2.  
- The platform offers staking, an invite-to-earn program, and a bridge for cross-chain asset transfers.
- Our project is designed to enhance the scalability and usability of decentralized finance (DeFi) on Layer 2 Ethereum solutions like Base, Arbitrum, or Optimism.

### Project Details

We plan to implement the following:

- **Decentralized Orderbook**: A core order matching engine with UI components for users to place and track their orders.
- **Cross-chain Bridge**: A secure bridge to facilitate asset transfers between Ethereum and other Layer 2 solutions.
- **Staking and Rewards System**: An on-chain staking mechanism that offers users rewards for participating in the platform.
  
We will use the following technology stack:
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based contracts on Ethereum Layer 2
- **Frontend**: React with Web3 integrations
- **Backend**: Node.js for off-chain services such as notifications and analytics

### Ecosystem Fit

- Silent Base operates within the **Ethereum Layer 2** ecosystem, helping solve high transaction fees and slow speeds.
- **Target Audience**: DeFi users, DApp developers, and users of decentralized trading platforms.
- **Unique Proposition**: Unlike other decentralized exchanges (DEXs), Silent Base focuses on scalability using Layer 2 solutions and an advanced cross-chain bridge.
