## Project Overview :page_facing_up:  

### Overview
`Relation Graph` is a substrate pallet that allows anyone to use GraphDB in [Substrate platform](https://substrate.io/).
`Relation Graph` provides organizations with ready-to-use GraphDB service for successfully running Dapps on the Substrate.  using `Relation Graph` Dapps builders can focus on bussiness logic by removing the complexities of Substrate.


### Project Details


**Relation Graph**

`Relation Graph` is a substrate pallet that allows anyone to use GraphDB in [Substrate platform](https://substrate.io/).
`Relation Graph` provides organizations with ready-to-use GraphDB service for successfully running Dapps on the Substrate.  using `Relation Graph` Dapps builders can focus on bussiness logic by removing the complexities of Substrate.
1、one click deploy on substrate;
2、Mask complex all on-chain operations with sparql;
3、sparql as blockchain.

It supports the following specifications:
* [SPARQL 1.1 Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/), [SPARQL 1.1 Update](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-update/), and [SPARQL 1.1 Federated Query](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-federated-query/).
* [Turtle](https://www.w3.org/TR/turtle/), [TriG](https://www.w3.org/TR/trig/), [N-Triples](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-triples/), and [N-Quads](https://www.w3.org/TR/n-quads/).
* [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results JSON Format](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-json/) and [SPARQL 1.1 Query Results CSV and TSV Formats](https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-results-csv-tsv/).

**Usage**

1. SPARQL Update

Call extrinsic `sparql_update` with SPARQL for `insert, update, delete` operations.

Try SPARQL update in [Pallet Interactor](http://localhost:8000/substrate-front-end-template) as follows.

- Insert Data

Sample SPARQL: insert a record for person `P001`

```sparql
INSERT DATA
{
   :P001 :name "Luna" ;
         :gender "Female" ;
         :age 35 ;
         :birthdate "1986-10-14"^^xsd:date ;
         :friends :P2, :P3 .
}
```

- Update Data

Changes to existing triples are performed as a delete operation followed by an insert operation in a single update request. 
The specification refers to this as `DELETE/INSERT`

Sample SPARQL: update age to `36` for person `P001`

```sparql
DELETE
{ :P001 :age ?o }
INSERT
{ :P001 :age 36 }
WHERE
{ :P001 :age ?o }
```

- Delete Data

Sample SPARQL: delete all properties of person `P001`

```sparql
DELETE WHERE
{
:P001 ?p ?o .
}
```
Sample SPARQL: delete partial properties of person `P001`

```sparql
DELETE WHERE
{
:P001 :age ?age;
      :name ?name .
}
```
2. SPARQL Query

Call RPC `sparql_query` with SPARQL for `query` operations.

```bash
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"id":1, "jsonrpc":"2.0", "method": "sparql_query", "params": ["SELECT ?name ?age  WHERE { :P1 :name ?name; :age ?age .}"]}' \
    http://localhost:9933    
```


### Ecosystem Fit

- Relation graph  can effectively reduces the development threshold of building Web3 decentralized applications which contains large data.
- It will bring a pallet of graph database to Polkadot ecosystem.

## Development Status :open_book:


- We have finished a version on Internet computer.It is a graph database written in Rust and deployed on WASM.Ereryone can try it here(https://kziov-eaaaa-aaaag-aaaxa-cai.ic0.app/ic_graph_developer.html).


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:
