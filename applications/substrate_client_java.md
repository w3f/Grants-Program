## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### Tagline: Java version of a Polkadot/Substrate network client.

The key objective of this grant is to design and build a production ready Java (one the most popular platforms) client which allows Java applications to interact with Polkadot/Substrate based networks. The substrate-client-java will be a library written in Java and fully compatible with Java 8 which still is the most common version of Java in enterprises.

#### Relevance to Substrate & Polkadot

There currently is a number of language-specific client libraries that can be used to interact with Substrate-based blockchains, as indicated in [client-libraries](https://docs.substrate.io/v3/integration/client-libraries). However no stable and well maintained Java library for Java applications exists:
- [polkadot-java](https://github.com/polkadot-java/api) is totally outdated, thus absolutely unusable.
- [polkaj](https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj) is not maintained, lacks support for Java 8 (the most popular version of Java so far), is focused mainly on polkadot so isn't generic enough and doesn't provide any easy/convenient way to operate a custom pallet.

The objective of this grant is to fill in this gap. Being an enterprise ourselves and building comercial products with substrate we know exactly what is needed for other enterprises to have the best experince with the Substrate.

### Project Details

#### Key deliverables

- *Java 8 or higher.*
The substrate-client-java will be compatible with Java 8 and higher, in order to make this library available and usable for as many projects as possible.

- *Non-blocking API.*
  The API is designed to be non-blocking in order to not engage resources to wait for responses from a node, especially when working with web sockets.
  
  Each method returns `CompletableFuture<>`.

- *Declarative approach.*
- *Make API simpler for usage.*
- *Let users organize their code similar to the one in the pallet they are interacting with.*
- *Hide difficulties of low level and infrastructure code.*
- *Facilitate the future maintenance.*

#### Annotations and code generation

The best approach to reach projectâ€™s goals is to use annotations and code generation techniques. Below are listed some annotations that this API shall provide:
- [x] Scale
    - [x] `@ScaleWriter`;
    - [x] `@ScaleReader`;
    - [x] `@Scale`;
    - [x] `@ScaleGeneric`;
    - [x] `@Ignore`;

- [x] Rpc
    - [x] `@RpcInterface`;
    - [x] `@RpcCall`;
    - [x] `@RpcSubscription`;
    - [x] `@RpcEncoder`;
    - [x] `@RpcDecoder`;

- [ ] Pallet
    - [ ] `@Pallet`;
    - [ ] `@Transaction`;
    - [ ] `@Query`;
    - [ ] `@EventHandler`.

These allow the generation of scale serializers, deserializers, RPC methods, code for interaction with pallet, etc.
In the next sections you will find further examples.

---
**Note:** In the list above [ ] indicates annotations not yet developed, whereas [x] those that have been developed already.

---

- *@Pallet* is going to be a common annotation to combine others in the same interface.
- *@Query* annotation will be developed in Milestone 1.
- *@EventHandler* annotation will be developed in Milestone 2.
- *@Transaction* annotation will be developed in Milestone 3.

#### Deferred parametrization of codecs
Annotations for codecs allow deferring parameters of a generic until it's used at an RPC method. E.g.:
 ```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Getter
@ScaleWriter
public class Some<A> {
    private final int number;
    private final A some;
}

@RpcInterface(section = "test")
public interface TestSection {
  @RpcCall(method = "sendSome")
  CompletableFuture<Boolean> doNothing(@Scale Some<Parameter> value);
}
```
Annotation processors will generate scale writer for the class `Some` which expects another writer as a dependency.
When a processor faces a parameter like `Some<String> value`, it injects the `Strings`'s writer into the writer of `Some`.

#### GC Manageable requests.
We take care of either lost responses or canceled futures by not holding handlers that are needed to match an RPC request with a response.

#### Tests run with substrate node.
All API methods related to the substrate node will be tested for operability and compatibility.
Currently we use [test containers](https://www.testcontainers.org/) and docker image [parity/substrate:v3.0.0](https://hub.docker.com/layers/parity/substrate/v3.0.0/images/sha256-1aef07509d757c584320773c476dcb6077578bbf2f5e468ceb413dcf908897f1?context=explore). But we have plans to increase number of supported versions.

#### Our vision of the API

##### How to generate scale codec for DTO (implemented)

```java
@RequiredArgsConstructor
@Getter
@ScaleWriter
public class SignedExtra<E extends Era> implements Extra, SignedExtension {
    @Ignore
    private final long specVersion;
    @Ignore
    private final long txVersion;
    @Ignore
    private final BlockHash genesis;
    @Ignore
    private final BlockHash eraBlock;
    private final E era;
    @Scale(ScaleType.CompactBigInteger.class)
    private final BigInteger nonce;
    @Scale(ScaleType.CompactBigInteger.class)
    private final BigInteger tip;

    @Override
    public AdditionalExtra getAdditionalExtra() {
        return new SignedAdditionalExtra(specVersion, txVersion, genesis, eraBlock);
    }
}
```

##### How to generate RPC interface (implemented)

```java
@RpcInterface(section = "author")
public interface Author {
    @RpcCall(method = "hasKey")
    CompletableFuture<Boolean> hasKey(@Scale PublicKey publicKey, String keyType);

    @RpcCall(method = "insertKey")
    CompletableFuture<Void> insertKey(String keyType, String secretUri, @Scale PublicKey publicKey);

    @RpcCall(method = "submitExtrinsic")
    @Scale
    CompletableFuture<Hash> submitExtrinsic(@Scale Extrinsic<?, ?, ?, ?> extrinsic);

    @RpcSubscription(type = "extrinsicUpdate", subscribeMethod = "submitAndWatchExtrinsic", unsubscribeMethod = "unwatchExtrinsic")
    CompletableFuture<Supplier<CompletableFuture<Boolean>>> submitAndWatchExtrinsic(@Scale Extrinsic<?, ?, ?, ?> extrinsic,
                                                                                    BiConsumer<Exception, ExtrinsicStatus> callback);
}
```

##### Create instance of API (TBD)

```java
Api api = Api.builder()
        .useWs()
        .withNodes("127.0.0.1:9944", "127.0.0.2:9944")
        .scanAnnotatedFrom("com.my_company.first", "com.my_company.second")
        .build();
```

##### RPC: call method (implemented but not integrated into the API)

```java
CompletableFuture<RuntimeVersion> versionFuture = api.getRpc()
        .getState()
        .getRuntimeVersion();
```

##### RPC: subscribe (implemented but not integrated into the API)

```java
CompletableFuture<?> unsubscribe = api.getRpc()
        .getChain()
        .subscribeNewHeads((ex, header) -> { print(header); });
```

##### Pallet: transaction (TBD)

```java
api.pallete(MyPallet.class)
        .myExtrinsic(someValue)
        .signAndSend(KEY_PAIR);
```

### Ecosystem Fit

#### How does substrate-client-java fit into the ecosystem

We have identified that many teams dealing with both legacy and up-to-date Java systems need to define appropriate approaches to communicate with Substrate-based blockchains. For example wrapping the polkadot javascript client or trying to build their own implementation. We intend to make this work easier by offering to the community a ready to use and production ready library to be used in all Java application. We will use this solution ourselves in our production environment, since we have multiple applications running on different versions of Java platform that needs to communicate with the Polkadot ecosystem.

#### Target audience and needs met by substrate-client-java

With our solution we meet the need of any Java developer who needs to write new Java applications or adapt existing Java applications to communicate with a Substrate based blockchain.

#### Other projects similar to substrate-client-java 

To our knowledge only one other project has tried to create a java library to communicate with Substrate-based blockchain, [java-client](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/java-client.md). 
This project however was focused mainly on implementing what we indicated as "Declared known RPC sections and methods", and is targeting Java 11.

Our solution targets Substrate instead of Polkadot, and is implemented with code generation technique, which brings a more generic, flexible and adaptable library. Our client is designed so that a custom pallet can be easily consumed without writing much code. And we support Java 8+ which still is the most popular version according to multiple surveys:

Moreover we are ready to share the client library  we are developing and its source code to the community, further develop and maintain it. We have resources and are ready to deliver later bugfixes, improvements, new features and keep the client up to date with the newer versions of Substrate. We plan to grow a community of Java developers who need to integrate their applications to a Substrate-based blockchain and the usage of substrate-client-java will ease their work.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** We heard about the Grants Program by Web3 Foundation and we have been in contact with managers at parity.io who guided us towards this application.

We have indicated the work we have already done in the section  [Features Roadmap](#features_roadmap) above, where we indicated the already implemented features with [x].
