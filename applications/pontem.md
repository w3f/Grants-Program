- **Payment Address:** 32AAAxmKJ9XxCsGSwt11oAuovCUHbgsgfY.

## Project Overview

### Overview

Pontem Network aims to bring the Move VM and Move language, and ecosystem around it to Polkadot.

The Move language and the Move Virtual Machine, both developed by Facebook Libra, are among the safest technologies out there that enable the creation of smart contracts. While having built-in security by design such as resource-oriented architecture and formal verification, Move VM still severely lacks toolsets and documentation.

We are going to create the Move pallet to make it possible for developers to publish their Move VM modules and execute scripts, also, we already built a rich toolset and documentation for Move language, so we will need only adopt it for Polkadot.

This is where our team has a unique experience, due to over 2 years spent working with Move and building tools around it. We have been working closely with Libra (as recognized technical adopters) as part of the Dfinance project which is utilizing the Move language and Move VM in order to run safe and usable smart contracts.

### Project Details

Implementation of Move VM pallet won't be an easy task, even taking into account our experience connecting Move VM with Cosmos SDK, achieved via integrating Move VM as GRPC service.

In the case of Polkadot WASM Runtime we can’t repeat the same approach with GRPC due to limitations of Runtime, but we can do a more elegant solution by utilizing Move VM inside Runtime. To be clear let’s see our plan step by step.

1. Move VM and language written in Rust language and can be compiled to WASM, unfortunately we can’t use crates that depend on runtime. We will create a stable working pallet by forking of Move VM/language and replace creates with ones we can use.
2. We will make Move VM outputs (writesets) compatible with Polkadot key-value storage, as during our latest research we discovered it’s not going to work “out of the box” and will require some time to build a solution. Same with address format SS58, and non VM balances.
3. We need to make gas usage of Move VM compatible with Polkadot standards. At least by using the same units like other VMs/pallets using.
4. Build a documentation around the Move pallet, adopt existing tools and docs about VM and language.

We already have rich experience in these topics because of our current Dfinance project, so far we developed:

- [Cosmos SDK Move VM](https://github.com/dfinance/dnode/tree/master/x/vm) module, brings Move VM to Cosmos SDK.
- [Documentation](https://docs.dfinance.co/move_vm) of how to write your own Move modules and scripts on Dfinance network.
- [VSCode plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=damirka.move-ide) to write modules and scripts for both Libra and Dfinance network.
- [IntelliJ plugin](https://github.com/dfinance/intellij-move) for Move language.
- [Move VM](https://github.com/dfinance/dvm) as a server.
- [Toolset](https://github.com/dfinance/move-tools) for Move language: dissembler, resources viewer, language server, executor.
- [Move Book](https://github.com/dfinance/move-book) - the first book about Move.
- [DeFi contracts](https://github.com/dfinance/contracts) framework on Move language.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Developers can be interested to build their DApps on Polkadot using Move technology stack, as it’s a safe and useful language which is getting more and more adoption.
- Libra is developing and using Move, so Polkadot will have at least initial compatibility with Libra at least by allowing using the same modules in both networks.
- Flow - Crypto Kitties creators blockchain also going to utilize Move VM and language, also by creating new language on top of it - Cadence, which can be adopted to Polkadot later.

## Future Plans

Wings Stiftung plans to continue supporting Move ecosystem. We want to build a bridge between Polkadot and Libra as Parachain, and launch our Parachain with Move VM pallet inside. Also, we going to proceed with further development of toolset (Move debugger, unit-testing framework, etc.) and extend our Wallet with Polkadot-specific features.

## Additional Information

Wings Stiftung will be as well supporting financially this project. We are going to apply to another Grant for the implementation of the [Pontem network](https://pontem.network).
