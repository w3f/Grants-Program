## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

ChainViz Alpha web application, available at [alpha.chainviz.app](https://alpha.chainviz.app), is an [open-source](https://github.com/helikon-labs/chainviz) real-time 3D visualization of the Kusama relay chain block production process.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helikon-labs/chainviz/development/readme_files/screenshot_01.png)

Application in its current alpha version provides the following features:

- Real-time 3D visualization of:
  - Active validators, including paravalidation indication
  - Block production by validators
  - Block finalization
- Navigation of the 3D scene through zooming, panning and rotation
- Network status display
- Active validator list and search over identity/address
- Validator details panel upon click on a validator in the 3D model, or the validator list

**This application is to fund the building of the first major version of ChainViz**, with the following features/visualizations:

- Complete rebuild of the the existing functionality with improved UI/UX and WebGL models, shaders and animations
- Additional support for Polkadot
- New visualizations
  - Parachains
    - Assigned paravalidators
    - XCM messages between parachains, or from parachains to relay chains
  - Block content
    - Author
    - Extrinsics and arguments
    - Events and arguments

With these additional features, ChainViz is going to become a **complete real-time visualization** of the Polkadot and Kusama relay chains and their parachains.

### Project Details

#### Organization

ChainViz v1 upgrade is a collaboration between [Helikon Labs](https://helikon.io) and [Klad](https://klad.design), carried out under the management of Helikon Labs.

#### System Architecture

##### Current System

ChainViz Alpha currently utilizes [SubVT backend services](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend) and Polkadot JS API as follows.

- SubVT active validator list [service](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend/tree/development/subvt-validator-list-server)
  - List of all active validators
  - For each validator, a summary including:
    - Identity
    - Validator preferences
    - Self stake
    - Nomination count and total amount,
    - 1KV data if exists
    - and more
- SubVT network status [service](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend/tree/development/subvt-network-status-server)
  - Era index
  - Era reward points
  - Total, minimum, maximum and average stake amounts
- Polkadot JS API
  - Finalized block header subscription
    - Utilized to mark finalized blocks
  - Best block header subscription
    - Utilized to display the block production animation
    - Identify uncle blocks and visualize them

Current ChainViz Alpha system architecture can be illustrated as follows.

    <br />
    <i><b>Figure 1</b> ChainViz Alpha system architecture</i>
</p>

##### Proposed Upgrade

Proposed upgrade to the first major version requires the following additional data:

- Block details
  - Extrinsic list and parameters
    - XCM messages (`XcmPallet` extrinsics)
  - Event list and parameters
- Validator details

Proposed system architecture for the upgrade can be illustrated as follows.

<p align="center">
 <img width="600" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helikon-labs/Grants-Program/helikon-chainviz-application/applications/chainviz-files/02-chainviz_v1_system_architecture.png" />
    <br />
    <i><b>Figure 2</b> ChainViz v1 proposed system architecture</i>
</p>

Upgraded system utilizes the **to-be-developed** SubVT `Block Details Service` to access the block content (i.e. extrinsics and events), and the **existing** SubVT `Validator Details Service` for any necessary validator data that is not available through the validator list service.

##### Block Details Service

A new addition to the [SubVT Backend](https://github.com/helikon-labs/subvt-backend), `Block Details Service` is going to be a websockets subscription service that pushes in JSON format at every new block to a subscribed client:

- Block hash, parent block hash
- Block number
- Block author and its on-chain identity (if exists)
- Block contents
  - Extrinsics, their module names and arguments
  - Events, their module names and arguments

This service is going to be utilized in both displaying the block contents and cross-chain messages as extracted from the `XcmPallet` extrinsics and events.

#### UI/UX Upgrades

We're going to implement a number of UI/UX upgrades, as explained below.

- Improvement of the overall aesthetics and visual coherence of the application
- A better depiction of the block production process that's easier to comprehend for a wider range of users from the technically informed to the newly-introduced
- Display of block contents (i.e. hash, number, author, extrinsics and events) on hover and click
- Responsive design for a range of screen sizes
- A better utilization of the 3D space to allow for parachain visualization and preparation for future upgrades
- Display of parachains, their assigned validators and the cross-chain messaging process

UI/UX upgrade implementation consists of 3 core components:

- Visual guidelines
- Application UI/UX upgrades
- WebGL graphics development, shaders and motion design upgrades

Development of the **visual guidelines** aims to bring visual coherency to ChainViz. From a functional perspective, this component serves as a core visual guide and foundation for all future UI/UX components and 3D graphics development.

**UI/UX upgrades** aim to elevate the project from a draft look to an efficient, performant, user-appealing, scalable web application. Visually, it will be based on the current project aesthetics while ensuring its responsiveness and accessibility. Through this work, we aim to increase usability and ensure application scalability in terms of functionality growth.

Third component of the visual upgrades, the development of the **upgraded WebGL graphics, shaders and motion**, faces a set of challenges that we aim to solve, including effective visualization of the block production and cross-chain messaging process. When we use the term effective visualization, we primarily mean one that:

- Can show the depicted processes in a simple yet systematic manner
- Can be engaging and valuable for users with different levels of expertise

### Ecosystem Fit

There is currently no direct match in the Dotsama ecosystem of the features offered by ChainViz. ChainViz Alpha got [shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/gavofyork/status/1491480880245874708) by Gavin Wood upon initial release, and received a lot of praise from various Dotsama ecosystem members.

<p align="center">
 <img width="400" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/helikon-labs/Grants-Program/helikon-chainviz-application/applications/chainviz-files/03-chainviz_alpha_gavin_wood_twitter.png" />
</p>

There are currently two other projects that visualize certain aspects of the Dotsama blockspace:

1. [Kusamaverse by Odyssey](https://odyssey.org/kusamaverse), which is closer to a metaverse space for Kusama, focuses more on the interaction of the actors in the ecosystem.
2. [XCM Dashboard](https://polkadot.subscan.io/xcm_dashboard) by the Subscan team, which is a fairly static visualization of the active cross-chain messaging channels between parachains.

ChainViz is unique in that it focuses on a very clear real-time visualization of the internals of the Dotsama machine. As we're going to explain in the Future Plans section, it also has the potential to have educational, entertainment and functional value through future development.
