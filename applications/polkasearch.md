## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkasearch.xyz aims to become a discovery platform where users can discover Grants, Bounties, Jobs, Tools, Educational material for Polkadot/Substrate, all under one roof.

**Grants:** Various DAOs can place their grant information on this website for free. They will have the CRM given by us or they can point user to external website if they wish for the user to submit grant application on their own end.

**Bounties:** Bounties are great way to outsource the work. You can list a task as a bounty and let developers apply for it in case it is technical bounty. A bounty is not only scoped to Technical development, it can be UI/UX, writing, etc. They can either use our CRM or can point bounty to external website.

**Jobs:** Various companies who are building on top of Polkadot ecosystem can place their jobs for free. They can either use our own CRM or they can point job to external portal of their own.

**Tools:** It's hard to find libraries, tools, packages on top of Substrate ecosystem. We aim to build and integrate directory of tools. User can filter tools according to their specification. User will be able to upload information regarding a tool on the website.

**Educational Material:** Get articles, educational videos, links of various substrate topics on the website. User will be able to upload tool/library name on the website.

### Motivation
I personally feel that discovery is a challenge when it comes to polkadot ecosystem. Ecosystem is big but it is very hard to find anything related to the ecosystem. If I search anything on Google about `Ink Smart Contracts` in 5-6th search result, it starts to show me Ink Jet printer cartiages. I personally believe that Polkadot is going to be very huge in the future and everything starts with the discovery so that more and more people are aware about tools, jobs, grants, etc.

### Ecosystem Fit
 - Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
We will become the discovery layer of Polkadot ecosystem.
 - Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Anyone who is either looking for a job, freelancing, looking for educational material are our users.
