## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkasearch.xyz aims to become a discovery platform where users can discover Grants, Bounties, Jobs, Tools, Educational material for Polkadot/Substrate, all under one roof.

**Grants:** Various DAOs can place their grant information on this website for free. They will have the CRM given by us or they can point user to external website if they wish for the user to submit grant application on their own end.

**Bounties:** Bounties are great way to outsource the work. You can list a task as a bounty and let developers apply for it in case it is technical bounty. A bounty is not only scoped to Technical development, it can be UI/UX, writing, etc. They can either use our CRM or can point bounty to external website.

**Jobs:** Various companies who are building on top of Polkadot ecosystem can place their jobs for free. They can either use our own CRM or they can point job to external portal of their own.

**Tools:** It's hard to find libraries, tools, packages on top of Substrate ecosystem. We aim to build and integrate directory of tools. User can filter tools according to their specification. User will be able to upload information regarding a tool on the website.

**Educational Material:** Get articles, educational videos, links of various substrate topics on the website. User will be able to upload tool/library name on the website.

1. User: A user can either be a `candidate` or an `employer`. A candidate can apply for a job, bounty, grant. Candidate cannot create job, bounty, grant. Candidate can only submit a tool or educational material. An employer can create Grant, Bounty, Job. She can also submit tool, educational material. An employer cannot apply for job, bounty or grant.
2. Grant: A `grant` can only be created by an employer. A candidate or multiple candidates can apply for a grant.
3. Bounty: A `bounty` can only be created by an employer. A candidate or multiple candidates can apply for a bounty.
4. Job: A `job` can only be created by an employer. A candidate or multiple candidate can apply for a job.
5. Tool: Both candidate and employer can add a `tool`.
6. Learn: Both candidate and employer can add a `learning material`.

#### Designs

Designs of few pages.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
We will become the discovery layer of Polkadot ecosystem.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Developers, writers, UI/UX, etc. all will be benifited by the project.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Our project can provide user with earning opportunities, learning material and tools required to build on top of Substrate ecosystem.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

  There is one project: https://earn.superteam.fun in solana ecosystem.
  In polkadot ecosystem, https://polkassembly.io/ and https://polkasearch.xyz have a few things in the intersection but our platform is more about providing opportunities to the end user in this ecosystem.

## Development Status :open_book:

Yet to start the development of the project.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone â‰ˆ 1 month.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1 FTE
- **Total Costs:** $10,0000 USD

### Milestone 1

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide the documentation on the README of the repository. If needed, we will create `docs` directory that would contain in-depth documentation. |

## Future Plans

Please include here

- Already in talks with **SquareOne** team to push it into substrate builders program once we have some metric to show.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Searched on Google

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- Work you have already done.
I have completed ink-boxes and ink-wizard grant in the past. They are into active development.
