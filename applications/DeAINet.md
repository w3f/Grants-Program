## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The DeAI project aims to deliver a fully decentralized artificial intelligence (AI) service network with highly scalable, crypto token incentivized and results in a solution that can serve as the application interface (API) layer in the decentralized development (web3) stack. We present solutions for incentivizing AI nodes for maximum usage of idle resources and distributing AI services for higher availability and security. This grant will allow us to implement a moonriver-based AI algorithm service protocol that can not only be used to decentralize computational provider but also used to create DeAI Algorithm NFT with multi-chain compatibility. All the AI pretrained weight files and source code will be deployed on IPFS as well as Algorithm NFT.

DeAINet as a part of Moonriver / Kusama / Web 3 Ecosystem and has Following Rich Properties

  - Protect the privacy for AI users by executing encryption protocol transparently.
  - Improve the security for AI system by miners consensus.
  - Strengthen robustness for AI service by DeAPI runtime redundancy of miners.
  - Save energy and reduce the service cost by making use of spare resource to mine.
  - Protect AI intellectual properties by algorithm NFTs.

  
### Project Details

#### Architecture
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/95557343/152795929-621711c2-8ab9-4af5-8dfe-078ad29ee7ee.png)

  - Users pay DEAI token to access DeAPIs. DeAINet will periodically generate a certain
amount of new DEAI tokens and half of them will reward to the most active
users. Another half tokens distribute to a random address as an airdrop.
After 4 years, no more DEAI is generated.

  - Miners earn 95%’ users’ paid DEAI to execute DeAPI on their hardware. Each
miner can run all kinds of DeAPIs to satisfy any kind of DeRequest. The
redundancy exactly achieves the decentralization and reliability of DeAINet.

  - Inventors earn 5% users’ paid DEAI as patent fee aside from miners, since they
are AI researchers or developers who invent and create new DeAPIs.

  - DEAI Stakers share profit from miners by staking DEAI to miners for DPoS
(Delegation PoS) consensus.

#### Technologies

  1. Deep learning frameworks: Pytorch, Tensorflow, MxNet, Caffe
  2. Docker
  3. libp2p
  4. Moonriver
  5. IPFS
  6. gRPC
  7. Rust
  8. Go

#### Components
  1. **Miner Network**
  It consists of all the computational power providers to offer decentralized AI as a Service which undertake to execute DeAPI to reply DeResponse for user's DeRequest. All the DeAPIs are deployed by Inventors on each miner. Thus, one miner is crashed other miners could follow up to replace the old one. This redundancy with shading could guarantee the decentralized and robustness for DeAI network. 
  
  2. **Inventor Network**
  It is a DAO sub-project for Inventors such as AI researchers and developers to submit their code and pretrain weights to setup AI service API through DAO mechanism which is a decentralized App with a UI website interface. Any inventors can submit a proposal to setup APIs but, only DAO approved proposals could finally be realized and accepted to deploy on all the miners. Therefore, DAO could make sure the quality and necessity for a new API creation. Meanwhile, once a new DeAPI is setup, a corresponding algorithm NFT is minted and send to inventors address as a digital patent. The user's  paid fee will send to NFT holders.
  
  3. **User Network**
  It consists of all the callable DeAPIs in the application layer for users to send request and retrieve the response which also implements a DPoS concensus aside from moonriver/kusama to guarantee the decentralization, venerable and security. 
  
  4. **NFT Marketplace**
  A marketplace beyond the DeAINet for traders to buy and sell algorithm NFT or digital patent to earn gains. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Using blockchain technology to construct a decentralized network to provide AaaS (AI as a Service) for App/Dapp developers to replace centralized API providers such as Microsoft Azure and Google AI.  We devote to build a decentralized SaaS platform to combine millions of users, computational power providers with API inventors in such a harmony way for offering extremely low costing and privacy preserving services in Web3.0 era. DeAI aims to become the world largest decentralized SaaS platform to provide high-quality API services with extremely cheap prices for Kusama multichain ecosystem. 

Similar Projects:
- **Livepeer** https://livepeer.org/ Only provides video encoding service instead of general usage. 
- **SingularityNet** https://singularitynet.io/ It's just a distributive AI API store with no API deployment redundancy to guarantee high performance, robustness and privacy preserving. There is no miner-inventor isolation to clear division of labour for API creation and execution. 
- **API3** https://api3.org/ It's a decentralized Oracle to provide off-chain data streaming for smart contract instead of on-chain computation works. 

AI market in Web3.0 and Metaverse:

- **Basic Recognition** Speech2Text, Voice2Text, Image Recognition, UGC NFT Recognition, Marketing Analysis, Algorithm Recommendation and Behavior Analysis. 
- **Game** PVE, Bot-AI
