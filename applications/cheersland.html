<p>CheersLand is dedicated to building an expandable GameFi universe where anyone can monetize their gaming experiences and social networks.</p>
<p>CheersLand has a complete product matrix and commercial closed-loop design, which provides gamified usage scenarios for crypto token holders without payment, composed of multi-game combinations, Ranking List, <em><a href="https://docs.cheersland.org/features/igo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Initial Gaming Offering (IGO)</a></em>, <a href="https://docs.cheersland.org/features/nft-market" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NFT Market</a> and Multi-asset Staking Platform.</p>
<p>The <em>Play to Earn</em> mode is adopted by some projects and caused enthusiastic response and commercial success in GameFi. In cheersLand, the <em>Play to Earn</em> mode is also adopted and optimized to be more suitable for ecological development.</p>
<p>Users are allowed to stake their tokens in the Staking Pool Contract developed by CheersLand or directly invite their friends through the exclusive link generated by CheersLand to earn <a href="https://docs.cheersland.org/features/gameplay#hp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Health Point(HP)</a>, the universal ticket for the CheersLand Multi-game Platform and used in the games of CheersLand.</p>
<p>All players who got rankings in the games will be rewarded every week. The weekly prizes are including but not limited to multi-asset airdrops of the sponsors, in-game items, revenue from regular business of CheersLand, such as IGO and NFT Market, etc..</p>
<p>CheersLand has launched the first classic game, <em>Crypto Pirates</em>, deployed on Binance Smart Chain and the feasibility of its business model has been verified while still in early access. Within two days of its launch, the game had accumulated more than 300 players.</p>
<p>In addition to <em>Crypto Pirates</em>, other games based on CheersLand will adopt the same business model and mechanism, which will help players earn continuous passive income.</p>
<p>Weâ€™d like to build a multi-game platform based on the Polkadot ecosystem and deploy <em>Crypto Pirates</em> as the first classic game to allow users to play the game with Polkadot wallets, and support users to stake their tokens or directly invite friends to earn HPs and rewards without payment.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Diversify the tokens of the web3 ecosystem.</strong> The multi-asset staking module developed by CheersLand will support DOT, KSM and all assets of blockchains based on Substrate to be staked and earn HPs which will be used in the games of CheersLand.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build the multi-game platform for the web3 ecosystem.</strong> The classic game <em>Crypto Pirates</em> and other games listed on CheersLand will be deployed on Polkadot and Kusama, which will bring growing users to the web3 ecosystem with the invitation mechanism.</li>
<li><strong>Optimize user experience.</strong> With the advantages of high TPS of Polkadot and Kusama, Dapps will achieve perfect integration with Cheersland and bring players a better experience.</li>
<li><strong>Expand the interactivity of crypto assets in CheersLand.</strong> Crypto assets in CheersLand can interact with all applications with the cross-chain technology of Polkadot, and share business models and user sources.</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to bring our Game-as-a-Service model to Polkadot, Kusama and to a variety of parachains, and provide gamified token use cases for web3 ecological users.</p>

<p>In order for the platform to quickly enter the efficient operation phase, we choose classic mini games as the prioritized type of games for launch.<br>
<!-- -->Classic mini games have a broad user base at any age around the world, and allow players to play the game at any time and anywhere with no barriers to participation.<br>
<!-- -->This is the reason why we chose to use the GameFi business model to power classic mini games and we want to pay tribute to the classics. All games based on CheersLand will adopt similar business models and gameplay.<br>
<strong>The general concepts in the games are as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong>HP:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Health Point (HP) is the universal ticket for the Cheersland Multi-game Universe. Players can play all games based on CheersLand if they have HPs and spend 1 HP for once play.
There are two ways for players to earn HP:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the exclusive invitation link generated by CheersLand to invite friends to visit CheersLand.</li>
<li>Participate in staking on the Multi-asset Staking Platform.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Scores:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Scores are the core indicators for evaluating the gaming ability of the players.</p>
<p>The smart contract of CheersLand will automatically record the player&#x27;s scores in the game. Different games will adopt different scoring formulas. Taking <em>Crypto Pirates</em> as an example, the scoring formula is:</p>
<br>
<div align="center"><i>Scores=Î£CT*DP</i><br></div>
<br>
<p><strong>Scores</strong> refer to the player&#x27;s effective scores only including the total scores of the levels passed by the player.<br>
<strong>CT</strong> refers to the Coins Touched of each level and Coins are the in-game items.<br>
<strong>DP</strong> refers to the Difficulty Points of each level and it&#x27;s set to a linearly increasing sequence.</p>
<p><strong>Ranking List:</strong><br>
<!-- -->Ranking List is the leaderboard sorted by the games&#x27; scores. The current rankings only show the top 100, which means the scarcity of seats.</p>
<p>Ranking List can reflect the engagement of players to a certain extent. It is an effective way to rank and screen users, and also an important indicator for evaluating user value to the network. It is worth mentioning that the ranking will be dynamically changed and updated at all times, which means that all players will always be in competition.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/grant/p2-The+snapshot+of+Ranking+List.png" alt="Ranking" class="img_ev3q"></p>

<p>We can see that Ranking List can screen out valuable GameFi users for the CheersLand ecosystem, and it will be very meaningful to motivate them. Weekly Tournaments, titled by the sponsors, will take a weekly snapshot of the leaderboard and reward the players on the list for their engagement. CheersLand will provide diversified prizes by attracting external sponsors and internal ecological benefits.</p>

<ul>
<li>Players need to spend HPs to participate in the games to get scores as good as possible.</li>
<li>Players can earn more HPs through staking or inviting friends to visit CheersLand.</li>
<li>Ranking List will show the top 100 players based on their scores.</li>
<li>The players listed on the leaderboard will have the chance to earn rewards every week.</li>
<li>The rewards are including but not limited to multi-asset airdrops of the sponsors, in-game items, revenue from Regular business of CheersLand, such as IGO and NFT Market, etc..</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multi-game-combination">Multi-game Combination<a href="#multi-game-combination" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Multi-game Combination" title="Direct link to Multi-game Combination">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>The <em>Play to Earn</em> mode allows players to have chances to earn rewards for long term in the CheersLand Multi-game Platform. In addition, players can earn extra HPs by staking tokens or inviting friends to visit CheersLand to get more chances to win the games and accrue value to the network. Users benefit from their social network, which guarantees the continuous supply of CheersLand user sources.</p>
<p>The Staking and Invitation Contract developed by CheersLand dev team can enable users to earn HPs through the <strong>Multi-asset Staking</strong> and <strong>Invitation Mechanism</strong>. It is currently deployed on Binance Smart Chain and passed the audit of the Solidity Finance team.</p>
<p><strong>Read audit report:</strong> <a href="https://solidity.finance/audits/CheersLand/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://solidity.finance/audits/CheersLand/</a></p>
<p>CheersLand has launched the first classic game, <em>Crypto Pirates</em>, based on the principle of simplicity and ease to play, which is deployed on Binance Smart Chain and the feasibility of its business model has been verified while still in early access. Within two days of its launch, the game had accumulated more than 300 players.</p>
<p><strong>Launch Dapp and play the game:</strong> <a href="https://cheersland.org/game.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://cheersland.org/game.html</a></p>

The CheersLand dev team plans to launch <em>Click Click</em>, <em>Gold Miner</em>, <em>Block Builder</em> and other classic games in the next few quarters, and will also deploy them on the Polkadot ecosystem once the game is running stable.</p>
<p><strong>The advantages of multiple-game combinations are as follows:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Satisfy the preferences of multiple user groups</li>
<li>Relieve the fatigue of players and enhance User Stickiness</li>
<li>Resonate between games with common in-game items</li>
<li>Provide more commercial scenarios

<p>The CheersLand team has completed the development of the Staking Contract, allowing players to stake tokens on Multi-asset Staking Platform to earn HPs.</p>
<p>The rules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users choose any asset that has been listed on Multi-asset Staking Platform for staking.</li>
<li>There are restrictions on the staking minimum of the tokens. For example, 1 DOT is the staking minimum if you choose to stake DOT. 2 or 3 DOT are also acceptable.</li>
<li>The staking duration is 24 hours, and users will be able to claim tokens staked once it ends.</li>
<li>The more you stake, the more HPs you will earn. For example, Stake every 1 DOT for 24 Hours, then you will earn an extra HP. Similarly, you will earn 2 HPs if you stake 2 DOT.</li>
<li>Staking multi-asset is acceptable, which means that users are free to stake all kinds of tokens listed on Multi-asset Staking Platform at the same time. The contract will record them all.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next stage, Various staking products with different staking caps, different staking duration and different prizes will be launched to provide users with more options.
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/grant/p4-multi-staking+asset+framework.jpg" alt="stake" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<div align="center"><i>Multi-asset staking framework</i></div>
<br>
<p>We have completed the UI design of the Multi-Staking Platform deployed in Binance Smart Chain, and the product will be officially launched next week. It will support users to stake all their assets on Binance Smart Chain and earn HPs. We&#x27;ll share the updates here.</p>
<p>We plan to make the Multi-asset Staking Platform integrate Polkadot and Kusama and support a variety of parachains. A draft of the UI of CheersLand Multi-asset Staking Platform for Polkadot and Kusama is shown below:
<img decoding="async" loading="lazy" src="https://cheersland.s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/docs/grant/p5.png" alt="asset" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="invitation-mechanism">Invitation Mechanism<a href="#invitation-mechanism" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Invitation Mechanism" title="Direct link to Invitation Mechanism">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>We designed an invitation mechanism to unlock the potential of users&#x27; social network, which acts as the engine for user growth.</p>
<p>When the user clicks the <em>Invite Friends</em> button on the page, CheersLand will generate an exclusive link based on the user&#x27;s blockchain address. Once other users visit CheersLand through the exclusive link and authorize the contract to confirm the invitation relationship, both the host and guest will increase 1HP for the game.</p>
<p>The Invitation Contract developed by the CheersLand team will record the user&#x27;s invitation data and calculate HPs. Now it&#x27;s live on Binance Smart Chain and will be deployed on Kusama for testing soon, live on Polkadot and parachains eventually.</p>
<p>The contract owner has the authority to modify the maximum amount of invitations. Since it is still in the early access stage, we set the maximum amount of invitations to 10 for each user.

<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="anti-cheating-mechanism">Anti-cheating Mechanism<a href="#anti-cheating-mechanism" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Anti-cheating Mechanism" title="Direct link to Anti-cheating Mechanism">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>In order to guarantee the fairness of the game, we have designed an anti-cheating mechanism. Taking <em>Crypto Pirates</em> as an example, the anti-cheating mechanism mainly consists of the following four points:<br>
<strong>Auth Token:</strong> When the user connects the wallet address, a time-sensitive token will be automatically generated to restrict the login environment and prevent the bot from running game scripts.<br>
<strong>Timing Window Algorithm:</strong> While the gamer touches in-game items to get scores, it will be recorded as a state. It will be considered cheating once the interval between the two states is too short. This feature is added to avoid running game scripts.<br>
<strong>Distance Window Algorithm:</strong> Once the user&#x27;s in-game coordinate shifts too far in a short period of time, it will be considered cheating. The addition of the feature will avoid running game scripts.<br>
<strong>Non-gaming Operation Blocking:</strong> While the user clicks on the pause button, sponsored ad pages will be displayed full screen, which prevents the user from using pause time to consider how to pass the levels. Also it prevents users from using screenshot tools to cheat in the game.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>The goal of this project is to build a multi-game platform with the staking and invitation contract for Polkadot and Kusama, and bring our Game-as-a-Service model to the web3 Ecosystem.</p>
<p>All web3 ecological users can visit CheersLand and play games without payment to earn rewards with the Polkadot wallet. CheersLand will also support DOT, KSM and all assets of blockchains based on Substrate to be staked and used in the games of CheersLand to diversify the tokens of the web3 ecosystem.</p>
<p>The classic game <em>Crypto Pirates</em> will be the first game deployed on Polkadot and Kusama, and optimized its user experience with the advantages of high TPS. Crypto assets in CheersLand can interact with all applications with the cross-chain technology of Polkadot, and share business models and User sources.</p>

<p><strong>Goal - Implement Game module and logic in the Polkadot ecosystem.</strong><br>
<!-- -->In order to implement whole Game logic for Polkadot &amp; Kusama, and be more compatible with crypto assets such as DOT and KSM, we will deploy ink! smart contracts on Aster. The reason why we choose Aster is that Aster can provide faster transaction speed, lower trading fee and higher flexibility, which fits perfectly with our game.<br>
<!-- -->Our front-end will develop the connect function for Polkadot &amp; Kusama&#x27;s wallet, in-game rankings, invitation mechanism and other features. In order to be compatible with different blockchains, developers will also make corresponding code adjustments.<br>
<!-- -->The in-game advertising content will also be flexibly configured as a sponsor&#x27;s brand display according to different blockchains, bringing a complete Game-as-a-Service model to the Polkadot ecosystem.<br>
<strong>Therefore, under this milestone, our deliverables include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Support Polkadot &amp; Kusama wallet connect dashboard</li>
<li>Invitation Mechanism Contract with ink!</li>
<li>Players&#x27; performance statistics and ranking interface</li>

<p><strong>Goal - Implement Multi-asset Staking Platform and the second game.</strong><br>
<!-- -->We will develop the multi-asset staking module and deploy the Staking Contract on Aster with ink!. When users stake tokens as required, the contract will count HPs based on their staking status. All contracts will be released and used after the audit is completed. We will develop the Multi-asset Staking Platform and open several staking pools including DOT and KSM first. Players can earn HPs by staking a certain amount of DOT or KSM and use them in the game.<br>
<!-- -->Our game dev team will develop a new classic game for the Polkadot ecosystem, similar to the Crypto Pirates deployed on BSC, which will adopt the same business model and anti-cheating algorithm.</p>
<p>We will optimize UI and allow players to have a more cheerful gaming experience.<br>
<strong>Therefore, under this milestone, our deliverables include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-asset Staking Contract with ink!</li>
<li>Multi-asset Staking Platform(Web UI) supporting staked asset such as DOT and kSM</li>
<li>Classic games deployed in the Polkadot ecosystem</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>Security Audit:</strong> We will audit the Staking and Invitation Contract code and the fronted code before launching and using the platform.</li>
<li><strong>Optimization of business model:</strong> Other business segments of CheersLand will be linked with the multi-game platform. The gamified launchpad for startups is named Initial Gaming Offering (IGO) in CheersLand, which is currently under development and expected to be launched at the end of the month. NFT Market for trading in-game items based on CheersLand will be launched next quarter. We will share the updates of development here. At that time, we will connect these two segments with the multi-game platform to better integrate the businesses.</li>
<li><strong>Regular Running:</strong> Eventually, we hope to hold the weekly tournament and run CheersLand Multi-game Platform on a regular basis and create commercial revenue for the platform. We will invite projects in the Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem to list their tokens on the multi-asset staking pallet and allow the token holders to stake tokens and earn HPs to play games in the multi-game platform.</li>
<li><strong>Classic games are launched one after another:</strong> After the stable operation of Crypto Pirates, we will work with the developer community to develop and release other classic games on CheersLand Multi-game Platform, and deploy them on Polkadot and Kusama to provide more gamified token use cases for web3 ecological users.</li>
