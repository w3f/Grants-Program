Delmonico&#x27;s is a <strong>chain</strong> of restaurants in U.S. where the notables liked to go, among them Nikola Tesla. Tesla
worked every day from 9:00 a.m. until 6:00 p.m. or later, with dinner at exactly 8:10 p.m., at Delmonico&#x27;s
restaurant. So Delmonico&#x27;s is a <strong>chain</strong> with Tesla going in it. An ideal codename for such a project. 😊</p></blockquote><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h3><p>The goals of the project is to develop and deploy an infrastructure dedicated to the supervision of charging station,
strongly coupled with a micro-payment infrastructure. The technical requirements of the solution are the following :</p><ul><li>It must be very <strong>secure</strong>. Especially, only allowed people and computers should be able to interact with charging
stations. Payments must fulfill latests security constraints especially regarding DSP2.</li><li>It must be as <strong>cheap</strong> as possible to operate. The challenge is to meet the security requirements without having
additonal costs or having to rely on external third-party.</li><li>It must be <strong>easy to deploy</strong>.</li><li>It must be <strong>easily scalable</strong>. Other parties should be able to join the networks without compromising the security
of the infrastructure.</li></ul><p>Taking into account the above-mentioned constraints, we have chosen to base our solution on blockchain technology, for
the following reasons :</p><ul><li>It is secure by design and <strong>quasi impossible to hack</strong> if carefully used and implemented.</li><li>It allows <strong>strong authentication</strong> through the use of wallets</li><li>It allows <strong>secured delivery versus payment</strong>. Each payment can be related to a dedicated delivery of service and the
proofs of the delivery can be stored in case of dispute.</li><li>The <strong>trustless</strong> nature of the technology allows adding new network participants without compromising the security of
other participants.</li><li>The deployment can be easy and secured if <strong>each charging station is also a network node</strong>.</li></ul><p>The reasons why we chose Substrate/Polkadot are :</p><ul><li>By having nodes with a dedicated purpose, we will be able to optimise the footprint of the node in order to deploy it
to charging stations, that have limited available resources</li><li>We can choose the most suitable consensus mechanism and especially combine POA on the parachain with PoS on the relay
chain.</li><li>We have the flexibility to chose between multiple target topologies. E.g. one parachain for all energy providers on
the platform, or one parachain by energy provider.</li><li>The composability of the FRAME architecture allows us to reuse existing pallets (e.g. identity, membership, contracts,
...) while being able to add our own specific pallets.</li><li>Since we have connections to multiple interfaces (payments, charging power, mobile apps) the offchain features of
Substrate will alllow us to handle the connection with external sources in both directions in a secure manner.</li></ul><p>Lumena is creating this project because it is a startup studio focused on innovative technologies and especially
blockchain. Our goal is to create new generation of services in collaboration with industry partners. We have a well
structured process in order to decide if we create a company or not. The following schema details this process :</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/lumena-tech/delmonicos/blob/main/w3f-grant-submission/lumena_process.png?raw=true" alt="Lumena Process Description" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>For Delmonicos, we are currently in phase two where we have to develop a POC of the platform, in order to address risks
and to show the feasibility of the project. If we can fund this phase and if the results are positive, we&#x27;ll create a
company dedicated to develop and sell the platform. We are applying for the 30k$ Open Grant Program from w3f that will
definitely allow us to do these two phases.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>The following schema describes the overall architecture of the project.
<img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/lumena-tech/delmonicos/raw/main/w3f-grant-submission/delmonicos.jpg" alt="Delmonicos architecture" class="img_ev3q"></p><ul><li>Mockups/designs of any UI components : We have not yet realized mockups nor UI design. We will connect existing
supervision platform to a back-end API. We will also have a mobile app with an embedded wallet to validate charging
sessions.</li><li>API&#x27;s specifications of the core functionality : not yet defined.</li><li>An overview of the technology stack to be used. Rust for the blockchain development with substrate and very probably
Ink! to be able to easily inject new rules. React on the front-end. Mobile app will be developed natively, starting
with ios. The non blockchain back-end will be developed in Rust with actix-web for the http API. We will start by
developing a blockchain front-end similar to substrate-node-ui-template.</li><li>Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed</li><li>PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic. Current work is located
at <a href="https://github.com/lumena-tech/delmonicos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/lumena-tech/delmonicos</a></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-management">Data Management<a href="#data-management" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Management" title="Direct link to Data Management">​</a></h4><p>We don&#x27;t plan to store private data on-chain. Only figures regarding the Kwh consumed for charging sessions and
corresponding price. Otherwise, proofs will be stored on-chain (e.g. proof of consent of starting a charging session,
proof of consent of bank account debit, ...). Proofs will mainly consist in hash of structured data signed by
external actors.</p><p>We will take care of being GDPR compliant. Private data will be stored of chain. The detailed design of data
management will be decided during the development of the project. We already have experience in developing GDPR
compliant blockchain based system for identity by having heavily contributed to the development of <a href="https://tokeny.com/onchainid/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OnchainId</a>.
<a href="http://docs.onchainid.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">API documentation</a>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>At that stage, we are not aware of any similar projects. The fact that charging stations themselves would be
blockchain nodes is a real innovation. We are currently talking with 2 solid players in the market around this
technology that would be a breakthrough:</p><ul><li>A solid French manufacturer of charging station that would be keen to propose simpler and cost effective
micropayment solution</li><li>A Historic car manufacturer that would be keen to facilitate access to its large network of customers (B2C and B2B)
by providing easy and accessible payment solution to the future EV driver.</li></ul><p>With both of them, that are demonstrating solid interest, we would be able to engage POC and even Spin off, should
we be successful in the current phase.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Fabrice CROISEAUX</li><li>Michel ONFRAY</li><li>Antoine DETANTE</li><li>Franck LEGARDEUR</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Fabrice CROISEAUX</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:fabrice.croiseaux@lumena.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fabrice.croiseaux@lumena.tech</a></li><li>Website: <a href="https://www.lumena.tech" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.lumena.tech</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> 2 rue Maurice Barrès, 57000 METZ FR</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> Lumena</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><ul><li>Fabrice CROISEAUX is CEO of InTech, a company dedicated to software development, and a subsidiary of POST

solution. First step will be to find investors (coming from industry or VCs). Future developments will include :</p><ul><li>The ability to automatically detect who is trying to charge his EV, based on the location of the station and on
the location of users, choosing the closest user.</li><li>A fully working production ready mobile app with an embedded wallet to identify and authenticate users, being
compliant with RDPG and ideally EIDAS for signature. Being EIDAS compliant will probably not be possible at short
term because the current regulation doesn&#x27;t take into account blockchain specificities. We will nevertheless
integrate concepts described in the following document : <a href="https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/2020-04/SSI_eIDAS_legal_report_final_0.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SSI eIDAS Legal Report. How eIDAS can legally support digital identity and trustworthy DLT-based transactions in the Digital Single Market</a></li><li>A payment module that will be compliant with DSP2. Our goal is to develop a reusable module that interact with
banks to prove that the acount owner has given his consent to initiate payment from his account. Here we can
leverage the security of the blockchain to comply with PISP constraints. Opportunities are well described <a href="https://worldline.com/en/home/knowledgehub/blog/2018/january/PSD2-and-instant-payment-what-are-the-opportunities-for-e-merchants.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li><li>Capability to add innovative possibilities via Ink! Smart Contracts. e.g. variable pricing depending on the load
of the energy network, pricing could be determined by consensus, charging session reservations, etc...</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="additional-information-">Additional Information ➕<a href="#additional-information-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Additional Information ➕" title="Direct link to Additional Information ➕">​</a></h2><p>We are convinced that this project has a huge potential to solve the majority of problems or paint points that EV
users are facing regarding charging their vehicule. This is typically a domain where blockchain technology is the ideal
technology by allowing the secure digitalisation of assets (charging power, money and identity) and the secure
conversion of value between these assets. Our potential partnerships with actors mentioned above will give us direct
access to the market.</p></div><footer class="theme-doc-footer docusaurus-mt-lg"><div class="theme-doc-footer-edit-meta-row row"><div class="col"><a
