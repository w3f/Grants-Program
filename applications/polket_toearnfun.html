Because to let the majority of users enter the Web3 world, the interactive way of life scenes is the easiest entry. So we started from the fitness field and developed a Web3 smart fitness application, allowing ordinary users to pick up fitness equipment, training daily + GameFi, and gradually understand how the Web3 world can bring them more value and fun.</p><p>Although <strong>STEPN</strong> achieved great success and dazzling attention as soon as it was launched, it also exposed the following problems:</p><ol><li><strong>Getting started is difficult and high risk</strong>. Beginners first need cryptocurrency and buy at least one virtual sneaker before they can start running. Due to the long-term price instability of cryptocurrencies, users cannot grasp the timing of buying cryptocurrencies, which can lead to serious losses.</li><li><strong>Insufficient decentralization</strong>. <strong>STEPN</strong>, like most GameFi, adopts the solution of decentralization of asset transactions and centralized gameplay. This is because due to the bottleneck of the current smart contract technology, it is impossible to achieve complete decentralization, so the game system has the risk of self-theft, such as inflated rewards, malicious bans, and service suspension.</li><li><strong>Incentives are not sustainable</strong>. The incentive tokens generated by <strong>STEPN</strong> running are freely circulated without restrictions, and the business model is unsustainable, and will eventually enter a death spiral.</li><li><strong>Is really cross-chain?</strong>. Although <strong>STEPN</strong> publishes the same kind of assets on both public chains, the asset values are different, and it is not a cross-chain in the true sense.</li></ol><p>After noticing the above problems, we finally adopted <strong>Substrate</strong> as the underlying technology in technology selection, and developed a blockchain named <strong>Polket</strong>. The goal of <strong>Polket</strong> is to create more commercial application scenarios for NFTs and connect to the Polkadot/Kusama network in a parachain manner. Based on the <strong>Polket</strong> chain, we will develop a smart fitness-type Web3 application to achieve capabilities that <strong>STEPN</strong> cannot achieve. We will name it <strong>ToEarnFun</strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-log.svg" alt="logo" class="img_ev3q"></p><p><strong>ToEarnFun</strong> is a <strong>fit to earn</strong> Web3 smart fitness application. Compared with other <strong>x-to-earn</strong> applications that only have <strong>SocialFi</strong> and <strong>GameFi</strong> elements, it can be connected with real smart fitness equipment. It relies on the encryption technology of the hardware chip to ensure that the sweat is paid fairly. The entry-level users of <strong>ToEarnFun</strong> do not need to purchase cryptocurrencies, but only need to purchase smart fitness equipment adapted to the application, and they can <strong>fit to earn</strong> immediately, greatly reducing the difficulty for ordinary users to enter the web3 world.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-features">Project Features<a href="#project-features" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Features" title="Direct link to Project Features">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="easy-to-use">Easy To Use<a href="#easy-to-use" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Easy To Use" title="Direct link to Easy To Use">​</a></h4><p>After the fitness equipment producer has passed the official qualification certification of <strong>ToEarnFun</strong>, the producer will register the chip public-key on the blockchain for each piece of fitness equipment produced. The user purchases <strong>ToEarnFun</strong> fitness equipment in the store, and completes the activation in the App, then can get a <strong>VFE</strong> (<strong>Virtual Fitness Equipment</strong>, it can be understood as a type of <strong>NFT</strong>). Users train through fitness equipment every day, and the system calculates the corresponding rewards based on the <strong>VFE</strong> attribute value on the chain.</p><p>Compared with <strong>STEPN</strong>, which requires users to use cryptocurrencies to purchase <strong>Sneaker</strong>, <strong>ToEarnFun</strong> does not require users to own cryptocurrencies, and it is easier to meet regional compliance requirements in terms of sales methods. The <strong>ToEarnFun</strong> community is formed by a group of users with real fitness needs, and is also a group that is optimistic about the future of Web3. Opens a door for Web2 users to enter the <strong>Polkadot ecosystem</strong>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="equipment-chip-embedding-proof-of-training">Equipment Chip Embedding Proof Of Training<a href="#equipment-chip-embedding-proof-of-training" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Equipment Chip Embedding Proof Of Training" title="Direct link to Equipment Chip Embedding Proof Of Training">​</a></h4><p><em>How to prove that the player has completed the training?</em></p><p>In order to realize the <code>Proof Of Training</code> algorithm, we need to embed a crypto algorithm in the chip of the smart fitness equipment. The equipment needs to generate a key pair and register the public key on the blockchain before leaving the factory. After the user activates the equipment, each time he completes the training, the equipment will sign the training data and submit it to the blockchain to complete the proof, and finally the user will receive a fair reward.</p><p>Since the private key of the equipment is generated by the chip before leaving the factory, the player cannot obtain it and cannot tamper with it, which prevents the player from modifying the training data through software, but the player can still cheat through physical plug-ins. However, with the development of technology, we will add motion sensors and biological inspection technology to the equipment to record more valuable data for player training and to prevent cheating by physical plug-ins.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="fitness--gamefi">Fitness + GameFi<a href="#fitness--gamefi" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Fitness + GameFi" title="Direct link to Fitness + GameFi">​</a></h4><p><strong>ToEarnFun</strong> not only has the advantages of smart fitness applications, but also realizes the gameplay of <strong>GameFi</strong>. The core of the game is <strong>VFE</strong>(<code>Virtual Fitness Equipment</code>) as the gameplay, <strong>VFE</strong> has a level system, with four basic attributes (efficiency, skill, luck, durability), four rarities (common, elite, rare, epic), and available power. When the user activates the equipment, they will get a <strong>VFE</strong> of common rarity and level 0 for free. Users can earn <strong>FUN</strong> by consuming energy through daily train, <strong>FUN</strong> is a consumable in <strong>VFE</strong> gameplay, used to: upgrade <strong>VFE</strong> level, <strong>VFE</strong> charging, Synthesize <strong>VFE</strong>, transaction fees, challenge events and more. <strong>VFE</strong> Get attribute points for each level up, and users can configure attributes independently. At present, the equipment we are implementing to interact with VFE is smart jump rope.</p><blockquote><p><code>VFE</code> is shorthand for <code>Virtual Fitness Equipment</code>. It can be understood as a subclass of <code>NFT (non-fungible token)</code>. We will create <code>VFE</code> such as <code>Smart Jump Rope</code>, <code>Smart Hula Hoop</code>, <code>Smart Boxing</code>, <code>Spinning Bike</code> on the chain. What the user gets is a unique <code>VFE instance</code> minted by <code>VFE</code>.</p></blockquote><p><em>Basic attribute description:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Efficiency</strong>: It affects the amount of <strong>FUN</strong> income. The higher the efficiency, the more stable the income growth. It is recommended for entry-level users to configure.</li><li><strong>Skill</strong>: Affects the training score factor. The higher the skill, the higher the <strong>FUN</strong> income from training score conversion. Training score can dramatically increase or decrease your income, so recommended configuration for advanced users.</li><li><strong>Luck</strong>: Affects the drop probability of items and the amount of income added by random numbers on the chain.</li><li><strong>Durability</strong>: Affects <strong>VFE</strong> charging cost.</li></ul><p><em>Rarity Description:</em></p><ul><li><strong>Normal</strong>: Free with purchase of fitness equipment.</li><li><strong>Elite</strong>: Collect <strong>VFE</strong> parts and combine with <strong>VFE</strong> chips to mint a new <strong>VFE</strong>, with a small probability to obtain.</li><li><strong>Rare</strong>: <strong>ToEarnFun Official</strong> regular sales.</li><li><strong>Epic</strong>: Participate in the <strong>ToEarnFun official</strong> event to get it.</li></ul><p>Base stats and upgrade points, <strong>common &lt; elite &lt; rare &lt; epic</strong>.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-gameplay-is-completely-decentralized">The gameplay is completely decentralized<a href="#the-gameplay-is-completely-decentralized" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The gameplay is completely decentralized" title="Direct link to The gameplay is completely decentralized">​</a></h4><p>Most <strong>GameFi</strong> applications are implemented with <strong>asset transaction decentralization and gameplay centralized</strong> solutions. Because most Dapps are implemented based on smart contracts, limited by the execution efficiency and upgrade difficulties of smart contracts, it is difficult to achieve decentralized gameplay. Thanks to the forkless upgrade feature of <strong>Substrate</strong>, we can implement the gameplay on the chain, and more new gameplay can be implemented through the <strong>Runtime</strong> upgrade in the future, which will be a Web3 application in the true sense.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-application-scenarios">Project Application Scenarios<a href="#project-application-scenarios" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Application Scenarios" title="Direct link to Project Application Scenarios">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="combination-of-physical-industry-and-blockchain">Combination of Physical Industry and Blockchain<a href="#combination-of-physical-industry-and-blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Combination of Physical Industry and Blockchain" title="Direct link to Combination of Physical Industry and Blockchain">​</a></h4><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-produce-model-en.png" alt="production" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Participants: <strong>Fitness Users</strong>, <strong>Equipment Producer</strong>, <strong>ToEarnFun Official</strong>.</p><ol><li><strong>ToEarnFun Official</strong> first needs to create a <strong>VFE</strong> class on-chain.
