## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Open Smartcontract Automation Protocol enables Polkadot developers to automate their Dapps by providing them decentralized infrastructure that is reliable, affordable and simple to use.

### Overview

We may have come across situations where a smartcontract had to be invoked repeatedly for the smooth functioning of a Dapp.

The first thing that comes to a Dapp builder's mind when faced with such a situation is to setup their own infrastructure to address this issue.
There are two reasons as to why this design is the first to come to a Dapp builder's mind:
  1. Web 2.0 offers several centralized solutions, some of which are easy-to-use, transparent (in their technicalities and billing), reliable (promises like 99.999% uptime), cost-effective and,
  2. Web 3.0 hasn't yet provided an open-standard that checks all the right boxes mentioned above and is decentralized.

Popular Web 3.0 automation solutions are good in some aspects but not so on the others.
For example, a protocol may deliver developer-friendliness but compromise on billing transparency.

For these reasons, I propose we design and develop an open protocol based on a few core design guidelines:
  1. open and welcome to everyone
  2. focus on the needs of stakeholders(Dapp devs and Infrastructure providers)
  3. strive for a simple, transparent, effective and affordable automation economics
  4. governed by stakeholders

### Project Details

We are brainstorming on the protocol design at this stage and welcome ideas and contributions from everyone.

We only aim to design and implement this protocol in the open, not monetize/govern it.

After finalizing on the protocol design, we will,
  1. publish a design document,
  2. architectural diagrams,
  3. implementation in code

For now, we have a rough scaffolding, which is highly unstable and subject to change.
Here is a high-level architectural diagram:

### Ecosystem Fit

We believe this work will be very beneficial to the builder community at large.
We couldn't find any such project/tool in the Polkadot ecosystem however,
they do exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, and as already mentioned, they do fall short in one or more aspects.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

The roadmap consists of three phases:
  1. Protocol design, documentation and evaluation
  2. Protocol implementation
  3. Integration and automation economics testing

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 Months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2
- **Total Costs:** TBA

### Milestone 1 Protocol design, documentation and evaluation

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:**  15000

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide extensive documentation describing the architectural diagrams, crucial design decisions and trade-offs of the protocol |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | N/A |
| **0d.** | Docker | N/A |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an article, updated regularly describing the progress being made |
| 1. | Design assets | We will share architectural design diagrams and user flows describing the inner workings of the protocol |
| 2. | Milestone 2 Plan | We will also share the deliverables components needed to realize this protocol |

## Future Plans

After we publish the protocol design document, we will apply for a grant to implement the same.
Therein, we will share the tech stack, and a detiled list of deliverables(code and docs) along with an estimated completion time.
Thereafter, as part of phase 3, we will discuss integration, user guides, both for Dapp devs and infrastructure providers.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

Gautam Dhameja told us about the Grants program and encouraged us to apply to the same.

We've successfully delivered on an RFP titled [ink!/pallet/solidity performance benchmarking](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/commit/27d653ac65a35feb410a1d0ee805469321ab4120)
