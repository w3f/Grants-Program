## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

We believe that the promising substrate blockchain technology enables us to bring a new way of gamification to a broad audience in a responsive, playful and immersive way. Our unique technical base allows us and the community to create independent games that can be deployed as enrichment to any substrate based chain.

### Overview

#### Introduction (A brief description of the project.)

This is a follow up grant, on https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/265, of which all milestone have been submitted.
* Milestone 1 [LINK](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/102) - [Evaluation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/evaluations/dotmog_1_alxs.md)
* Milestone 2 [LINK](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/161) - [Evaluation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/evaluations/dotmog_2_Noc2.md)
* Milestone 3 [LINK](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/162) - [Evaluation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/evaluations/dotmog_3_Noc2.md)

This followup grant is intended to create real value in the provided API, GameEngine, Service Layer and Unity Asset to help ramping up teams focusing on game develoment with substrate based chains, we are currently in development towards our early game access target in july for the DOTMog Mobile Game, which is our flagship game. The game has been described in our first open-grant application, as it is not part of the grant itself, we have removed the full description of it.

[DEMO (from May 2021)](https://youtu.be/xPE16aMZZpc)

What matters for the grant are the artifacts that can be reused and extracted out of our game framework. The intention is to build a full featuring SDK for Unity and Substrate, which will be provided as a free Asset in the Unity Asset Store [LINK](https://assetstore.unity.com/) and usable out-of-the box with the node-template pallet.

This is part of the components that **Jeton Network** is providing and maintaining for future blockchain game developers. Jeton Network intends to work towards a second order relay chain for games that like the benefit of using there own blockchain, but can't afford a parachain or parathread slot on Polkadot or Kusama.

### Project Details 

This is the follow up grant from our previous open grant on **Wave 9**. 

#### Mockups/designs of any UI components

This is our current Dev GUI, from our running alpha release, we will extract it to a template involving the non DOTMog specific artifacts, like Blockchain Info, Wallet Info and updated and add simple configuration options.

#### An overview of the technology stack to be used

#### Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed

* https://github.com/ajuna-network All components for the Generic Gaming Blockchain and the UnitySDK will be provided under the organisation Ajuna Network.

**Generic Game Pallets**<br/>
Generic Game Pallets, build special features used in games, they are fully supported in the UnitySDk<br/>
Match Maker Pallet, Game Event Pallet and ConnectFour Pallet using them both. More to come, ...

**UnitySDK for Substrate**
- Supporting features GameWallet (Wallet Creation, Restore, Mnemonic, Send)<br/>
People can easily sign in to your game, by creating a wallet. Password encryption to login and a mnemonic to transfer or restore a lost passwort or mobile device.  
- Supporting features Matchmaker (Queueing, Rankingsystem, Invites)<br/>
People can join Matches against other players in a ranked or unranked system, they are also able to create a match by invitation. The multiplayer setup enables turn based games with or with out time limitations an easy entry.
- Supporting features GameEvent (Events that happen on specified blocknumbers, like an egg hatching, turn time passed or auction period finished)<br/>
Easy access to Game Events for animation or updates that are triggered by storage updates. React on any on-chain events and create an interactive experience on mobiles. 
- Supporting features Asset (Create, Delete, Transfer, Buy/Sell, Auction)<br/>
Asset handling allowing to create, delete, transfer and auction them. Having full availability of the pallet asset in the UnitySDK enables devlopers create in game shops and auction houses. 
- Supporting feature for custom gamelogic<br/>
Custom logic can be easy implemented or at least it is well documented how the workflow works to get custom pallet functions into the UnitySDK.

The SDK includes a **premade GameEngine**, that supports the above features out of the box, additionaly, instead of connecting straight to the node over the substrateNetApi, it is possible to scale over a deployable ServiceLayer that offers a RestAPI to decouple client storage accesss to full nodes.

**SubstrateNetService**
The service Layer project can be deployed to a server as DOTNet application offering node storage information as RestAPI to the UnitySDK GameEngine. The Service Layer can add a persistent layer to store node storage, with a Database which is already supported and documented.

#### PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

Our alpha game is already running, check out our webpage (https://dotmog.com/).

The basic part of the open-grant has been developed as framework for our flagship game, as we where focusing on the game it self the API lakes inline comments and might be a little complicated to jump in with out a good documentation or tutorials.

A lot of our previous work on the World of Mogwais is being used as PoC for the current project, the game logic we created [WoMNetCore](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoMNetCore) is reused where it makes sense or refactored to match better, here an [old PoC](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/releases). We used the CryptoKitties on Substrate as our first crash course into Rust and luckily it had a theme in common with our vision from 2017 [old whitepaper](https://github.com/mogwaicoin/mogwai-doc/raw/master/doc/Mogwai_Whitepaper.pdf). 

### Ecosystem Fit 
I think currently there are no such projects in the substrate ecosystem, at least we don't know of any. The setup should enable an easy start in to game development with substrate.

### Team's experience
The team consists of three experienced developers, one project manager / designer and additionally two supplying artists working on illustrations and 3D models.
In past projects the team has already worked together on different projects one of them is [mogwaicoin](https://github.com/mogwaicoin) which has been live since 2018 and on the game on top [The World of Mogwais](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/releases). Besides that both devs have a background in reverse engineering of games and creating automations or simulators, like sabberstone. Our project manager is working in the financial sector in the same role for years as he is supporting the team. Based on the work of darkfriend77 Sabberstone simulator a lot of research and publications have been done in the AI domain (google: [sabberstone research ai](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_deCH914CH914&sxsrf=ALeKk006zio57YXebBkFf5i5F96dp67ePA%3A1612994036885&ei=9FUkYOvDNePEgwfIyLm4Ag&q=sabberstone+research+ai&oq=sabberstone+research+ai&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIHCCMQsAMQJ1AAWABg5RZoAXAAeACAAUeIAUeSAQExmAEAqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBAcABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjrjd-Ep-DuAhVj4uAKHUhkDicQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)) or even [ai competitions](https://hearthstoneai.github.io/index.html). Our passion is about creating games and/or enhancing the gaming experience for us.
