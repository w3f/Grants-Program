## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### Background

As a versatile blockchain framework, Substrate has a variety of modules (a.k.a. pallets) for developers to reuse. From resource management such as accounts and assets to utilities such as random number generators and schedulers, these existing pallets could meet the need of most developers' application scenarios. However, there is still room for improvement.

Recently we have a requirement to implement a data storage service on Substrate, and after checking through all existing pallets, we did not find one that meets our need. So we would like to develop a custom pallet to fulfill this purpose.

We are not talking about something very niche here. On the contrary, it is a common scenario that an application would continuously consume and generate various data, whether it is system, user, or just temporary levels, during operations. Many dApps have a large number of scenarios that require off-chain data storage services, such as NFTs. The quality of the storage service chosen will directly affect the performance and reliability of the entire application.

So we hope to offer Substrate/Polkadot community with pallets (and toolchains) dedicated for storage services that are compatible with current Substrate APIs. So developers only need to add tiny amount of code change to leverage CESS stable and secure data storage. We believe this will further enhance the development experiences when adopting Substrate and enrich the Polkadot ecosystem.

#### Current Solution

There is only one pallet related to data storage in the existing Substrate FRAME, aka, [Transaction Storage Pallet](https://paritytech.github.io/substrate/latest/pallet_transaction_storage/index.html). It supports running an IPFS node side-by-side with Substrate and allowing data to be retrieved by IPFS after putting it in Substrate storage. However, its application scope is greatly limited due to its inherent characteristics and several defects in the following aspects.

1. Data need to be uploaded to the blockchain network. Although this data is not actually stored on the chain, they still incur additional gas costs and congestion, which is not suitable for large file storage.

2. All validator nodes need to establish IPFS service for themselves, which subject to many restrictions.

3. The development is difficult since the Substrate-based code needs to be greatly modified.

4. This only supports file upload on the Substrate side. Viewers need to retrieve it via IPFS clients.


### Project Details

We design and implement a data storage service based on Substrate. On one hand, there is no need for a validator node to start additional service, and no major modifications to substrate-based code as well. Therefore, developers can easily integrate our storage service, whether it is a newly-built chain or an existing chain. On the other hand, by customizing the storage REST component, users could upload and download data conveniently without installing additional client programs.

#### High level design

Our proposal architecture is shown in the figure below, which consists of the Data Store Pallet and custom-built Storage Sidecar (inspired by [Substrate API Sidecar](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate-api-sidecar)).

# ![Figure 1: Proposal architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CESSProject/W3F-illustration/main/substrate-builder-program/09.svg)

*Figure 1: Proposal architecture*

- **Data Store Pallet**: Realize the recording and management of stored data. This pallet implements functions related to meta-data, e.g. root data management, data owner management, and data classification regarding the stored data.

- **Custom-built Storage Sidecar**: Provide RESTful service to interact with Data Store Pallet. The difference from Substrate API Sidecar is that, in addition to the basic functions of interacting with the substrate-based chain, Storage Sidecar encapsulates storage-related API, including data storage and data retrieval. The data transmitted by users will eventually be stored in [**CESS Storage System**](https://github.com/CESSProject/cess) through this interface.

#### Typical example

Data storage and retrieval are the two core features for a data storage service. They are illustrated in details below.

# ![Figure 2: Typical example process](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CESSProject/W3F-illustration/main/substrate-builder-program/10.svg)

*Figure 2: Typical example process*

- **Data Storage**

1. A user calls the data storage API of the Custom-built Storage Sidecar to upload the data file;
2. Forward the data to CESS by calling the encapsulated CESS API;
3. Once it is confirmed that the data has been written, Custom-built Storage Sidecar will call Extrinsic to record the relevant information of the data file on-chain;
4. CESS Storage System maintains the integrity and privacy of data throughout its life cycle.

- **Data Retrieval**

5. A user calls the storage API of the Custom-built Storage Sidecar to retrieve the target data;
6. Custom-built Storage Sidecar to query on-chain data routing information;
7. Call the CESS data retrieval API with the routing info;
8. Retrieve and return the target data from CESS Storage System;
9. Return the target data to Custom-built Storage Sidecar;
10. Custom-built Storage Sidecar updates on-chain information, if necessary;
11. Return the target data to the user.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
