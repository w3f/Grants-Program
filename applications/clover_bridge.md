## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

#### Introduction
The Clover Bridge is a threshold signature based protocol for enabling cross-chain communication between Polkadot based networks and non-Polkadot based networks. We propose an end-2-end secure communication protocol between signers for notarising block headers from Polkadot based parachains. Notarised block headers along with a patricia merkle path, generate proof of inclusion for transactions that can be verified outside the Polkadot context. By utilizing Schnorr signatures, Clover Bridge can communicate with Turing complete-blockchains like Ethereum, and non-turing complete blockchains like Bitcoin with the upcoming BIP-Schnorr upgrade.

#### Integration
  
Polkadot uses Schnorrkel/Ristretto x25519 ("sr25519") as its key derivation and signing algorithm (https://docs.rs/schnorrkel/0.10.1/schnorrkel/). Schnorrkel implements Schnorr signature on Ristretto [ris] compressed Ed25519 points, as well as related protocols like HDKD, MuSig [MPSW19], and a verifiable random function (VRF). In particular, schnorrkel provides Schnorr signatures, a fast Schnorr DLEQ proof based VRF, hierarchical deterministic key derivation (HDKD), and the safest currently known threeround trip Schnorr multi-signature variant. Ristretto implements roughly section 7 of Mike Hamburg’s Decaf paper [Ham15] to providethe 2-torsion free points of the Ed25519 curve as a prime order group. Avoiding the cofactor like this means Ristretto makes implementing more complex protocols significantly safer. We employ Blake2b for most conventional hashing in Polkadot, where schnorrkel/sr25519 itself uses the merlin limited implementation of Mike Hamberg’s STROBE, which is based on Keccak-f(1600) and provides a hashing interface well suited to signatures and NIZKs.

#### Team Interest
As a collective, the founding team has been working together for a almost about a year. We all come from different and unique walks of life, backgrounds, and experiences which really makes us a dynamic and strong team complementing one another's skill sets. Burak is based in the Bay Area, Mehmet in UK, Suleyman in Turkey, Norelle and Viven are based in Toronto. It is neat operating as a team across the globe because we can tap into different markets and bring different things to the table. 

### Project Details 

#### Technology stack
We are using eliptic curve notation for the discrete logarithm problem, and a verifiable Secret Sharing scheme (VSS) to prevent dealers from cheating where each signatory can verify their own share. The communication between the signatories are done through gRPC services with mutual SSL/TLS protocol. This protocol will only work with the certificates generated by the same internal Certificate Authority (CA). 


#### Architecture

### Ecosystem Fit 
As a decentralized financial service provider on Polkadot, Clover provides modular DeFi protocols and application tools, which greatly reduces the repeated efforts needed in the protocol development. Modular DeFi protocols include Staking Liquidity Protocol, Decentralized Trading Protocol, Decentralized Lending Protocol, Token Dividend Protocol, Governance Protocol, and Synthetic Asset Protocols. Clover allows its upper-layer application projects to focus on improving user experiences and accelerate innovations of diversified financial applications through its composability. Clover can potentially convert a large number of DeFi users into users of its upper-layer applications. This way, upper-layer applications will be able to bootstrap its community and inject more market values. 

Clover will also establish a developer-centric community. In addition to giving rewards to those who provide constructive contributions, Clover will encourage its third party developers to continuously build innovative dApps on top of Clover. Each project built on Clover by the third party developers will require a solid financial foundation, and generally donations from the community are insufficient to cover development expenses which results in stagnated growth. Therefore a sound funding mechanism has been established, The Developer Incentive Program, where all the projects building on Clover can benefit from a share of transaction fees. The Developer Incentive Program (DIP) is a Clover-native consensus feature that aims to direct a percentage of transaction fees to registered smart contracts to incentivize in Clover third party contract developers and commons, mainly to boost external dApp development which ultimately enlarges the Clover DeFi ecosystem overall. The program is consistent with Clover’s properties of being a decentralized operating system which does not touch the inflation schedule or alter the scarcity of CLV, but effectively increases the security of smart contracts against bugs and software vulnerabilities by enabling external development to be properly funded. Overall the benefits of the plan create the potential for a very exciting future in which Clover can grow and compete, and can reach its goal of becoming the best possible DeFi platform for all. Therefore Clover, whose key role is to be the service provider of which will allow a variety of applications to be built on top, aims to become a one-stop financial services platform that highly incentives users, developers, and upper-layer applications to innovate. 

With the rapid development of DeFi, the demand for insurance protocols is also increasing and has become an important part of the DeFi protocols. At the current stage of DeFi development, it is not yet possible to directly trade assets such as stocks, precious metals, and commodities. However, the synthetic asset protocol will allow simulations of assets price and facilitate transactions on the blockchain. In addition, the developer community we established will also become a source of innovative DeFi protocols. Clover allows modularization of the different protocols, thereby providing a resourceful module library for upper-layer applications, which will ultimately enable the creation of more diversified financial applications. With the help of Bithumb Global bootstrapping the liquidity of Clover by co-sharing its marketing and community resources, we will be advising Clover on the go-to-market strategies and PR placements as well as launching campaigns, educating Bithumb users, and distributing to our network.

### Team's experience
Within the team, Burak and Viven have known each other for 4 years and have worked together on a number of projects. Mehmet and Suleyman on the pther hand have known each other for 10 years, and worked together on a number of projects while they were at TUBITAK BILGEM between 2010 and 2015. They have not only done several applied projects together but also published several papers together (see Google Scholar for their common academic papers). Mehmet is expert on cryptographic design, architecture (in particular, blockchain and cryptocurrencies, secure multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption, threshold cryptography, zero knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs and Bulletproofs)) and mathematical structures of cryptography, where Suleyman is experienced on cryptographic analysis as well as implementation aspects of cryptographic algorithms/protocols. Mehmet and Burak have known each other for 3 years, and worked together on a number of projects including a brand-new on-chain scaling approach for zero-confirmation BTC payments. Burak initially came up with the idea of combining zkSNARKs with ePassports after Apple confirmed iOS 13 to include support for NFC passport reading. Mehmet and Burak then started playing around with the idea, before Suleyman joined the team.

## Future Plans
We will start to build the developer community when TestNet is ready and SDKs are available in Q1 and Q2 2021. Detailed documentations will be provided and more contents about developing applications on Clover will be released by then. We will work with some existing developer community to hold events, as well as holding/supporting hackathons to acquire more developers once developer kits are ready in Q2/Q3 2021. Bug bounty programs will be held when Mainnet is launched. 
For the user community, we plan to work with some industry media to release publications. Clover maintains its social media including Twitter, Youtube, Medium, and more to provide self-generated content, and covert followers and users to our Telegram, Discord, and Kakao groups. Marketing campaigns will be held to keep user activeness while Clover will focus on incentivizing users to participate in liquidity mining and governance activities. Key metrics of campaigns include the number of new user growth, the number of token holders, the number of members in the developer and the overall community, social media followers, total value locked (on liquidity mining applications), and number of votes.
