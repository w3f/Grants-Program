## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide the name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Pyre Browser is a Decentralized P2P browser that liberates the world from predatory markets.

It is a normal HTTPS browser (thats 44% faster than Firefox) but also has a secondary P2P internet. If I type in polkadot.com it will go to the main website. If I type in "polkadot" it will take you to a 404 page where you can purchase the domain. At current prices its $2500 for a 8 letter domain. After the site is purchased you can upload a folder and save the checksum to the blockchain. Every time a user searches for your domain their client will look for a 7z folder with the same checksum as noted on the blockchain and download it from peers. If you want to change the website you just upload the new folder and save again (It costs 0.1 cent in Glimmer to do this). Each user is then prompted to download the new version from peers.

The project includes PyrETH - a web3 alternative that is 16x smaller in size than the original and embedded in the browser. It also includes Polkadot extrinsics for cross chain compatability natively. We created this to make injected web3 code much more intuitive and faster for web developers. The DNS server is hosted on Moonbeam and allows for instant purchase and reselling of web domains. Uploading updated websites costs a fraction of a cent for web owners and is done with a simple upload dropbox in the DNS panel.

We created the project with a deep concern for the direction of the planet and environment. 

A strange fact...
---
### There are 200 million active websites and the average size of them is around 2mb. In total this is around 400 terabytes only.
### 200,000,000 x 2MB = 400TB
### It costs around $3000 to buy a 500 terabyte harddrive - The entire hosted internet (excluding image and video data) could fit on $3000 worth of storage!
---
Using 7zip compression we can lower the total figure to 240 terabytes. This is nothing! ...and yet the hosting industry totals to around $600bn. Google, Microsoft and Amazon use around 60tWh of energy each year. This is more than the bottom 170 countries in the world.

We suggest that most problems are caused due to irrational information sharing through the internet and provide a cybernetic solutions through Gaia Source and other integrated products

PyreMail:
A decentralized mailing system that takes advantage of Moonbeams low tx fees. I can send emails that are encrypted for around 0.01 cents. I also have a paywall for anyone who wants to send me an email to detract spammers, or maybe because I am a freelance consultant. The system also acts as an address name server. My username for my EVM address can be accessed by anyone. I can put my geolocation there also if I want it to be a shopfront. I can also create a rudimentary shop that lists products, or a wall for facebook style posts. This is all simply with a dynamic mapping in solidity (create item with price).

GaiaSource:
It offers a 0% fee alternative to Amazon, Ebay, Upwork, Ticketmaster, Uniswap. Im improving the UI and also adding a Trading View alternative built with Threejs. Theres also an alternative to Facebook that uses all the data mentioned in PyreMail but I need to find a better design for it.

Pyre Search:
Is the inbuilt indexer. It downloads every website as they are uploaded/updated and picks through all the code. It costs me $20 to thoroughly scrape all websites and efficiently index them. Googles methods require spiderbots, vast servers and access to various DNS servers data. Anyone could build a Google alternative with their own algorithm and $5-20 in server costs on the pyre network.

Finally, there is an inbuilt advertising system that shares 100% of revenue between site owners based on clicks. Its in the settings panel - just upload an image and then put <div className="PyreAd" style={{width: 300, height: 300}}/> in your webpage somewhere.

Our hope with GaiaSource is it will become a cybernetic hub for all to see transparently the flow of resources in the world and plan their lives accordingly.

### Project Details

The project is launched and fully functional for windows over at [](https://pyrebrowser.com) and has a roadmap in the documentation section. We need design, branding and marketing help. The browser is built with Electron and NodeJS. P2P infrastructure is handled with Holepunch HyperDHT and decentralized communication within domains is facilitated by NOSTR - A censorship free chat protocol supported by Jack Dorsey. My running costs are only $20 a month for the main webpage server. The project is completely decentralized otherwise!

### Ecosystem Fit

A browser that kills all major companies:

Google Mail
Email alternative that lets you charge spammers

Google Search
Indexes pyre sites without the use of mass servers or telemetry

DNS Companies
It lets you own domains for life with no hosting costs

Amazon/Ebay/Gig Websites
No need for AWS, also provides a 0% fee marketplaces

>Advertising Companies
Inbuilt advertising system that shares 100% of revenue

>Social Media
Inbuilt NOSTR chat on every domain + facebook alternative soon

## Development Status :open_book:

The project is completed and launched! We are now working on other interesting websites to complement the 0% fee ethos!

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 8
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  3 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 30,000 USD
- **DOT %:** 100%

### Milestone 1 Example â€” Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 8 months
- **FTE:**  3
- **Costs:** 30,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | GPLv3 |
| **0b.** | Documentation | Our documentation is over at [](https://pyrebrowser.com/docs) and will be expanded further to be more intuitive and have more templates for web3 dapps |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Marketing | Intense marketing campaign targeting all major internet communities. Revamp of the main website and hiring of a dedicated community manager. |
| 2. | Code Release | Release of code open source once we have acheived a solid community base of around 100 websites (or by June 2025) |
| 3. | DAOs | Development of template DAOs for our interconnected DAO system which allows people to form companies without paperwork and with autonomous shareholder features. We have several DAO models based on the works of Economists such as von Mises, Henry George, Hayek and Piero Sraffa which we hope to implement soon. (Very exciting permutations of economic theory into contracts!) |

## Future Plans

Our server costs are low and the internet is vast. We hope to shepheard as many unique and wonderful projects into the new web which is censorship resistant and kind to all.
