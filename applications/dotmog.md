## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

We believe that the promising substrate blockchain technology enables us to bring a new way of gamification to a broad audience in a responsive, playful and immersive way. Our unique technical base allows us and the community to create independent games that can be deployed as enrichment to any substrate based chain.

### Overview

#### Introduction (A brief description of the project.)

DOT Mog (substrate based Unity3D Game) - Immerse yourself in the futuristic universe of the Mogwais. Lead them to glory and honor. Experience epic and thrilling adventures & duels. Explore the infinite universe & mysteries.

As probably the first substrate based Unity3D game using our open-sourced (SubstrateNetApi) we bring the functionalities and benefits of this promising technology to a broad audience in a playful and immersive way.

* Breed, create your own unique Mogwais based on the highly sophisticated Pairing DNA Algorithmus.
* Care, learn the language of the Mogwais and respond optimally to their needs and gain a competitive advantage.
* Duel, prepare your Mogwai and fight in the Arena against other Mogwais from all over the world and achieve glory and honour. Move up to master leagues and compete with the best.
* NFT's, trade Mogwais and their precious goods and become a fortuned merchant.
* Explore, travel with interstellar spaceships into the vastness of space to unexplored and mythical places and experience exciting and challenging adventures.
* Innovative, the self-developed SubstrateNetApi allows for the first time full substrate integration in Unity 3D for game development. Benefit from the full stack of substrates blockchain technology.

DOTMog, is the follow-up project from the creators of "The world of Mogwais" on the mogwaicoin blockchain.

#### Integration of the game into Substrate (An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama)

The goal is currently to provide a pallet with the full functionality of the game, which can be independently deployed on any Substrate based chain. It is currently active as a reference implementation on its own chain ([DOTMog.com NET](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/?rpc=wss%3A%2F%2Fmogiway-01.dotmog.com#/explorer)). 
One of our big goals is to create further creatures in addition to the Mogwai, which have different characteristics depending on the universe on which they are located. So in a future step not only mogwais, but also kusamais or polkadais will populate the universe of the game and create a big community of gamers that loves to dive into this immersive experience.

#### Motivation (An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.)

We love the way we can materialize our ideas. Our small team consists of game and technology enthusiasts, who work in their leisure time with great dedication, passion and great intrinsic motivation on the project. Everyone inevitably has several hats on, we are developer, graphic designer, project manager, web designer and so on. We try to make up for this deficiency with our great enthusiasm and conviction in our almost daily work for the project.

#### Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed

We have been working on the World of Mogwais for a long time gaining experience in technology and game design, we were stopped by the limitations of the technology we were using, problems like freezing chains due to hash power spikes or no available storage made our lives hard. Just when we were giving up, we learned about substrate, so we dug into it and started to work on migrating and transforming our project into this new world of 3 sec block times and responsive storage access.

We differentiate the gamelogic into two parts, base logic which is not heavy computing intense which will run inside the node and intense computing gamelogic for example for a dungeon event, which we plan to outsource with an Off-Chain worker to a trusted computing environment.

#### PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

Our alpha MVP is already running, check out our webpage (https://dotmog.com/).

A lot of our previous work on the World of Mogwais is being used as PoC for the current project, the game logic we created [WoMNetCore](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoMNetCore) is reused where it makes sense or refactored to match better, here an [old PoC](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/releases). We used the CryptoKitties on Substrate as our first crash course into Rust and luckily it had a theme in common with our vision from 2017 [old whitepaper](https://github.com/mogwaicoin/mogwai-doc/raw/master/doc/Mogwai_Whitepaper.pdf). 

### Ecosystem Fit 
I think currently there are no such projects in the substrate ecosystem, at least we don't know of any. The full game logic is written down in our confluence, but for the sake of this file, we don't copy & paste it into here, but we can add it if necessary.

### Team's experience
The team consists of two experienced developers, one project manager / designer and additionally two supplying artists working on illustrations and 3D models.
In past projects the team has already worked together on different projects one of them is [mogwaicoin](https://github.com/mogwaicoin) which has been live since 2018 and on the game on top [The World of Mogwais](https://github.com/WorldOfMogwais/WoM-Releases/releases). Besides that both devs have a background in reverse engineering of games and creating automations or simulators, like sabberstone. Our project manager is working in the financial sector in the same role for years as he is supporting the team. Based on the work of darkfriend77 Sabberstone simulator a lot of research and publications have been done in the AI domain (google: [sabberstone research ai](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1CHBF_deCH914CH914&sxsrf=ALeKk006zio57YXebBkFf5i5F96dp67ePA%3A1612994036885&ei=9FUkYOvDNePEgwfIyLm4Ag&q=sabberstone+research+ai&oq=sabberstone+research+ai&gs_lcp=CgZwc3ktYWIQAzIHCCMQsAMQJ1AAWABg5RZoAXAAeACAAUeIAUeSAQExmAEAqgEHZ3dzLXdpesgBAcABAQ&sclient=psy-ab&ved=0ahUKEwjrjd-Ep-DuAhVj4uAKHUhkDicQ4dUDCA0&uact=5)) or even [ai competitions](https://hearthstoneai.github.io/index.html). Our passion is about creating games and/or enhancing the gaming experience for us.

## Future Plans
We believe that there is a lot of potential in our project and we have a lot of ideas to provide additional content that can fit on the technology that we are using.

#### Future Plans for MVP 2

- :rocket: **Milestone 6: MVP 2 — Features Stash / Item / Skills**  
- :rocket: **Milestone 7: MVP 2 — Features Combatsystem, Duells, League**  

#### Game Extension

- :rocket: **Milestone 8 Extension — Proving grounds & Interstellar Travel (Interchain operability)**  

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

The Milestones that have been marked as self funded include intellectual property of our brand and the core game, which includes game algorithm that shouldn't be public, which will run offchain worker on a trusted computing environment, it makes no sense in having this part open source as it would remove the games mysteries that are part of the DOTMog experience.

### ETA of the PROJECT

#### Currently we already have implemented the following Milestones

- :white_check_mark: **Milestone 1: SubstrateNetApi — Implement Basic Substrate .NET Standard 2.0 API**
