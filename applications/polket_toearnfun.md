## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Where did the idea come from?

Inspired by the success of **STEPN**, we have great confidence in Web3 applications combined with life scenarios. Because to let the majority of users enter the Web3 world, the interactive way of life scenes is the easiest entry. So we started from the fitness field and developed a Web3 smart fitness application, allowing ordinary users to pick up fitness equipment, training daily + GameFi, and gradually understand how the Web3 world can bring them more value and fun.

Although **STEPN** achieved great success and dazzling attention as soon as it was launched, it also exposed the following problems:

1. **Getting started is difficult and high risk**. Beginners first need cryptocurrency and buy at least one virtual sneaker before they can start running. Due to the long-term price instability of cryptocurrencies, users cannot grasp the timing of buying cryptocurrencies, which can lead to serious losses.
1. **Insufficient decentralization**. **STEPN**, like most GameFi, adopts the solution of decentralization of asset transactions and centralized gameplay. This is because due to the bottleneck of the current smart contract technology, it is impossible to achieve complete decentralization, so the game system has the risk of self-theft, such as inflated rewards, malicious bans, and service suspension.
1. **Incentives are not sustainable**. The incentive tokens generated by **STEPN** running are freely circulated without restrictions, and the business model is unsustainable, and will eventually enter a death spiral.
1. **Is really cross-chain?**. Although **STEPN** publishes the same kind of assets on both public chains, the asset values are different, and it is not a cross-chain in the true sense.

After noticing the above problems, we finally adopted **Substrate** as the underlying technology in technology selection, and developed a blockchain named **Polket**. The goal of **Polket** is to create more commercial application scenarios for NFTs and connect to the Polkadot/Kusama network in a parachain manner. Based on the **Polket** chain, we will develop a smart fitness-type Web3 application to achieve capabilities that **STEPN** cannot achieve. We will name it **ToEarnFun**.

### Overview

![logo](https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-log.svg)

**ToEarnFun** is a **fit to earn** Web3 smart fitness application. Compared with other **x-to-earn** applications that only have **SocialFi** and **GameFi** elements, it can be connected with real smart fitness equipment. It relies on the encryption technology of the hardware chip to ensure that the sweat is paid fairly. The entry-level users of **ToEarnFun** do not need to purchase cryptocurrencies, but only need to purchase smart fitness equipment adapted to the application, and they can **fit to earn** immediately, greatly reducing the difficulty for ordinary users to enter the web3 world.

### Project Features

#### Easy To Use

After the fitness equipment producer has passed the official qualification certification of **ToEarnFun**, the producer will register the chip public-key on the blockchain for each piece of fitness equipment produced. The user purchases **ToEarnFun** fitness equipment in the store, and completes the activation in the App, then can get a **VFE** (**Virtual Fitness Equipment**, it can be understood as a type of **NFT**). Users train through fitness equipment every day, and the system calculates the corresponding rewards based on the **VFE** attribute value on the chain.

Compared with **STEPN**, which requires users to use cryptocurrencies to purchase **Sneaker**, **ToEarnFun** does not require users to own cryptocurrencies, and it is easier to meet regional compliance requirements in terms of sales methods. The **ToEarnFun** community is formed by a group of users with real fitness needs, and is also a group that is optimistic about the future of Web3. Opens a door for Web2 users to enter the **Polkadot ecosystem**.

#### Equipment Chip Embedding Proof Of Training

*How to prove that the player has completed the training?*

In order to realize the `Proof Of Training` algorithm, we need to embed a crypto algorithm in the chip of the smart fitness equipment. The equipment needs to generate a key pair and register the public key on the blockchain before leaving the factory. After the user activates the equipment, each time he completes the training, the equipment will sign the training data and submit it to the blockchain to complete the proof, and finally the user will receive a fair reward.

Since the private key of the equipment is generated by the chip before leaving the factory, the player cannot obtain it and cannot tamper with it, which prevents the player from modifying the training data through software, but the player can still cheat through physical plug-ins. However, with the development of technology, we will add motion sensors and biological inspection technology to the equipment to record more valuable data for player training and to prevent cheating by physical plug-ins.

#### Fitness + GameFi

**ToEarnFun** not only has the advantages of smart fitness applications, but also realizes the gameplay of **GameFi**. The core of the game is **VFE**(`Virtual Fitness Equipment`) as the gameplay, **VFE** has a level system, with four basic attributes (efficiency, skill, luck, durability), four rarities (common, elite, rare, epic), and available power. When the user activates the equipment, they will get a **VFE** of common rarity and level 0 for free. Users can earn **FUN** by consuming energy through daily train, **FUN** is a consumable in **VFE** gameplay, used to: upgrade **VFE** level, **VFE** charging, Synthesize **VFE**, transaction fees, challenge events and more. **VFE** Get attribute points for each level up, and users can configure attributes independently. At present, the equipment we are implementing to interact with VFE is smart jump rope.

> `VFE` is shorthand for `Virtual Fitness Equipment`. It can be understood as a subclass of `NFT (non-fungible token)`. We will create `VFE` such as `Smart Jump Rope`, `Smart Hula Hoop`, `Smart Boxing`, `Spinning Bike` on the chain. What the user gets is a unique `VFE instance` minted by `VFE`.

*Basic attribute description:*

- **Efficiency**: It affects the amount of **FUN** income. The higher the efficiency, the more stable the income growth. It is recommended for entry-level users to configure.
- **Skill**: Affects the training score factor. The higher the skill, the higher the **FUN** income from training score conversion. Training score can dramatically increase or decrease your income, so recommended configuration for advanced users.
- **Luck**: Affects the drop probability of items and the amount of income added by random numbers on the chain.
- **Durability**: Affects **VFE** charging cost.

*Rarity Description:*

- **Normal**: Free with purchase of fitness equipment.
- **Elite**: Collect **VFE** parts and combine with **VFE** chips to mint a new **VFE**, with a small probability to obtain.
- **Rare**: **ToEarnFun Official** regular sales.
- **Epic**: Participate in the **ToEarnFun official** event to get it.

Base stats and upgrade points, **common < elite < rare < epic**.

#### The gameplay is completely decentralized

Most **GameFi** applications are implemented with **asset transaction decentralization and gameplay centralized** solutions. Because most Dapps are implemented based on smart contracts, limited by the execution efficiency and upgrade difficulties of smart contracts, it is difficult to achieve decentralized gameplay. Thanks to the forkless upgrade feature of **Substrate**, we can implement the gameplay on the chain, and more new gameplay can be implemented through the **Runtime** upgrade in the future, which will be a Web3 application in the true sense.

### Project Application Scenarios

#### Combination of Physical Industry and Blockchain

![production](https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-produce-model-en.png)

Participants: **Fitness Users**, **Equipment Producer**, **ToEarnFun Official**.

1. **ToEarnFun Official** first needs to create a **VFE** class on-chain. The first thing we implement is the **VFE** of the **rope skipping**.
1. To cooperate with **ToEarnFun**, equipment producers need to complete qualification certification and deposit a certain amount of security deposit into the **Producer Ledger** on the chain, which will be used to deduct fees for subsequent minting of **VFE** instances.
1. According to the deposit amount deposited by the equipment producer, the system grants the producer a certain number of **VFE** minting rights.
1. After the equipment producer completes the qualification certification, the **toearnfun-crypto-sdk** is integrated into the fitness equipment chip to realize the encryption protocol.
1. Before leaving the factory, fitness equipment needs to be registered on the **Equipment Ledger**, and a mintinng fee will be reserved from the **Producer Ledger** on-chain.
1. Fitness users can buy **ToEarnFun** cooperative fitness equipment in the local store without cryptocurrency.
1. Fitness users complete on-chain activation of fitness equipment through the **ToEarnFun** app.
1. After the fitness equipment is successfully activated, **Producer Ledger** will pay a minting fee from the reserved balance to **ToEarnFun Official Treasury**.
1. Because the producer has the minting right of the **VFE** class, a **VFE** instance will be minted on-chain to fitness users.
1. Fitness users can get a **VFE** instance for free, in fact, the producer paid the minting fee when registering the equipment on the chain.

This business model not only helps traditional fitness equipment producers enter the Web3 world, expands the user base, and promotes industrial development, but also brings stable income to **ToEarnFun** and motivates **FUN** on **GameFi** in the future. Modules provide the foundation.

### Fitness + GameFi

![Fitness+GameFi](https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-gamefi-model-en.png)

Participants: **Fitness Users**, **ToEarnFun Official**.

1. Fitness users use fitness equipment for daily training.
1. The fitness equipment signature training data will be reported to the on-chain **Training Ledger** through the App.
1. Calculate the reward according to the **VFE** attribute bound to the fitness equipment and the number of energy consumed during the training.
1. The **FUN** incentive module issues rewards to fitness users, but there is a daily upper limit on rewards.
1. Fitness users can use **FUN** to level up **VFE** instances to increase attribute points.
1. Fitness users can sell their excess **FUN** to the **FUN Buybck Pool**.
1. **ToEarnFun official** regularly buyback FUN in the pool.
1. After each buyback of **FUN**, its buyback price will change. In order to ensure price stability, changes in the **FUN Buyback Price** will affect its inflation rate.

This business model not only allows users who like fitness to get the equivalent of their sweat, but also allows users who are addicted to **GameFi** to have the goal of fitness.

### VFE Market

![VFE Market](https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-market-model-en.png)

Participants: **Fitness Users**, **ToEarnFun Official**, **3rd-party IP**.

1. **ToEarnFun Official** can approve 3rd-party IP certain amount of **VFE** minting rights.
1. Whether it is **ToEarnFun Official** or **3rd-party IP**, as long as you have **VFE** minting rights, you can mint new **VFE** instances.
1. However, every time a **VFE** instance is minted by a 3rd-party IP, the minting fee needs to be paid to **ToEarnFun Official**.
1. The newly minted **VFE** instance will be put into the **VFE** market and will be sold by auction or fixed-price.
1. Fitness users can consume **FUN** to unbind the **VFE** instance on the equipment.
1. The unbound **VFE** instance can be sold to the **VFE** market.
1. Fitness users can also buy their favorite **VFE** instances in the **VFE** market.
1. Fitness users buy VFE instances with better attributes, and then bind them to the equipment for training, which is the most effective way to earn **FUN**.

Compared with traditional games, **GameFi** has the characteristics of playability and possession, and game items have value. **ToEarnFun Official** can bring income through the sale of **VFE**, or it can also approve 3rd-party IP to mint **VFE** to bring income. Fitness users can also freely exchange **VFE** in the market to achieve arbitrage.

### Competition Challenge

![Competition challenge](https://github.com/aexkobe/hackathon-2022-summer/raw/main/teams/08-polket/assets/toearnfun-competition-model-en.png)

Participants: **Fitness Users**, **ToEarnFun Official**, **Public Welfare Organizations**.

1. **ToEarnFun Official** create competition template, set: registration fee, registration requirements, competition requirements, scoring rules, bonus distribution, cycle time limit, etc.
1. The competition template will publish event instances periodically.
1. Fitness users who meet the registration requirements can pay the registration fee to participate in the event.
1. Fitness users use their own fitness equipment to challenge according to the requirements of the competition.
1. The fitness equipment reports the training data to the on-chain competition record.
1. After the game, the game record will be determined according to the scoring rules of the game.
1. Prizes will be awarded to the winner of the competition.
1. A portion of the funds raised by the event will be invested in the **Public Welfare Treasury**.
1. The funds of the **Public Welfare Treasury** can be donated to public welfare organizations through the proposal of the Public Welfare Council.

The use of blockchain to realize competition events is a very suitable application scenario. It not only makes the competition fair, open and transparent, but also greatly reduces labor costs and allows the **Public Welfare Treasury** to obtain more funds. At the same time, **DAO** is used to manage the **Public Welfare Treasury**, which ensures the sustainable development of public welfare undertakings.

### Ecosystem Fit

#### Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

As we all know, it is more complicated for ordinary users to enter Web3. They need to buy cryptocurrencies and learn to use cryptocurrency wallets. Learn about different ecosystems and find out which Dapps are right for them.

I try to simplify this entry through the combination of `hardware + Substrate + Mobile App`. Let ordinary people only need to buy a smart jump rope at the retailer, and training everyday, Web3 will give them another income. Gradually, they will learn about the Polkadot ecosystem, and they will slowly discover that Polkadot's parachains can bring them more value.

#### Who is your target audience?

Our target audience are fitness enthusiasts and Polkadot ecosystem's users.

#### What need(s) does your project meet?

- Use token incentives to promote people's daily training and get healthy body.

|    0b. | Documentation                      | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works.                 |
|    0c. | Testing Guide                      | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests.                                                                                                             |
|    0d. | Docker                             | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone.                                                                                                                                                 |
|    0e. | Article                            | We will publish an article that explains the features and gameplay of this app.                                                                                                                                                                               |
|     1. | Substrate module: pallet-buyback   | The implementation of this module allows the buybackers to establish an asset buyback pool, set the buyback asset quota and buyback date, and allow participants to invest in asset A, which will be converted into asset B when the buyback date is reached. |
|     2. | Substrate module: pallet-vfe-order | This module implements the order book function of the VFE trading market.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|     3. | Flutter App: VFE Buyback Pool      | The app implements the buyback pool function, allowing users to invest in asset A and get another asset B when the buyback date is reached.                                                                                                                   |
|     4. | Flutter App: VFE Market            | The App implements the VFE trading market, allowing users to freely buy and sell VFE.                                                                                                                                                                         |
|     5. | Android Alpha-test Released        | We will release the first Alpha-test App supporting the android platform.                                                                                                                                                                                     |

When the milestones in the grant are completed, we will open source the entire project.
Our projects are open source based on GPL-3.0 license.

## Future Plans

1. We plan to apply for some funding from the `Kusama Treasury` before launching the `App beta version` to meet the first batch of equipment production. We will invite internal test users to the community, and distribute the first batch of equipment to them for free testing experience.
2. `Polket` plan to bid on Kusama's parachain slots to gain access to the Kusama ecosystem.
