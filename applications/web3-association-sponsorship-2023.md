### Overview

Fix the incentives through the evolution of treasuries.

Our focus is to support existing teams across web 3 ecosystems with improving their treasury systems. We achieve this through the creation and continued improvement of knowledge resources that help provide insights and actionable information for teams to use when improving their own treasury systems. The Web 3 Association is looking to create the industry preferred destination to learn about Web 3 treasuries.

We are looking to provide insightful and actionable information about treasury systems for the benefit of Polkadot, Kusama and any other ecosystem across the industry. Our resources and contribution efforts are relevant to any ecosystem that manages and disburses a treasury.

The Web 3 Association is a continuation of the type of work we did previous around funding categorisation (https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis). We realised that these resources were universally applicable to the entire industry and that our efforts could yield a far higher return on investment by helping many ecosystems and increasing the amount of shared learning (https://docs.web3association.co/approach/shared-learning) whilst also splitting the costs of the contribution efforts across many ecosystems.

### Project Details

The Web 3 Association has already been started and there are already initial resources that have been released around the topics of disbursement approaches and incentive design.

Current resources
- https://docs.treasuries.co
- https://disbursement.treasuries.co
- https://suggestions.treasuries.co

Our roadmap (https://docs.web3association.co/roadmap) focusses on improving and expanding on this work to make these resources more insightful and actionable. Once completed the resources will be ready for inviting more feedback and participation from people across different ecosystems, their efforts would be compensated through community incentives.

This project is both a research initiative that will lead to the creation and improvement of analytical resources and also a collaborative initiative that will attempt to bring people together around the topic of disbursement approaches and incentive design.

### Ecosystem Fit

As the Polkadot grows the value and importance of the treasury it manages increases with it. Our efforts are solely focussed on how that treasury can grow over time, how it gets managed and how the assets get disbursed to generate impactful outcomes.

Our target audience are the teams building treasury systems. Some of the high impact areas for this work would be around the OpenGov treasury system for Polkadot and the grants process for the Web3 Foundation. However this work is relevant to any protocol or application level team that has a treasury to manage as well as any other ecosystem that manages a treasury in the industry.

The need to improve treasury systems is high and only growing as the value of these emerging ecosystems grow over time. The Web 3 Association documentation helps to highlight the opportunity of improving treasury systems (https://docs.web3association.co/focus) where even small percentage improvements can lead to very meaningful improvements to the amount of impact that an ecosystems treasury could generate.

We have not seen any similar project in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem so far. The closest project we've found to date that works on somewhat similar research would be Meta Gov (https://metagov.org).

### Team's experience

George has a background in software development of over six years where he mostly worked with frontend technologies using React and React Native.

I started participating and contributing towards improving the Project Catalyst funding process in Cardano after seeing the potential for improving these growing treasury systems. My previous contributions focussed on funding categorisation (https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis). These resources led to the Catalyst team running workshops to change the funding categorisation approach in fund 11.

It is from this experience I realised the relevance of this work for the entire industry and have since started the Web 3 Association to start supporting and contributing to the entire industry. The Web 3 Association has the opportunity to be a scalable and cost efficient way to increase collaboration and the speed in which treasury systems are improved across many ecosystems.

## Development Status :open_book:

Current resources
- https://docs.treasuries.co
- https://disbursement.treasuries.co
- https://suggestions.treasuries.co

The disbursement and suggestion resources above are where we will be focussing most of our efforts on improving some of the existing resources as well as introducing new pieces of analysis that improve the usefulness of the overall resource. Community incentives will help with improving these resources even further before we then look to collaborate with existing teams in Polkadot, Kusama and the Web3 Foundation on how they could improve their treasury systems and processes - this could even collaboration around this grants process we're using now!

## Future Plans

All community incentive distributions will be made public so anyone can see what incentives existed, what was achieved and whom received any compensation for those incentives.

After this initiative is completed our resources will be in a good position to properly collaborate with existing teams to discuss their current approach and future experiments or changes they intend to make. We will be looking to collaborate with teams working on OpenGov and similar treasury initiatives in the Polkadot ecosystem which can also include collaboration around the grants process that is used by the Web3 Foundation. 

We share all of our resources and efforts on our social channels (https://linktr.ee/web3association) and will also be sharing our resources with teams across different ecosystems to see how they can provide value to their own development efforts.

After we finish collaborating with ecosystems about what disbursement approaches and incentive design mechanisms they are using we intend to collaborate with ecosystems to determine where we can best spend our contribution efforts moving forward. We would intend to make future proposals to help cover those contribution efforts once a suitable next step of direction has been determined. Our short and longer term ideas in terms of the roadmap are already documented (https://docs.web3association.co/roadmap)

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website

Previous work:
- https://docs.catalystcontributors.org/funding-categorisation-analysis - Our previous work helped lead to changes in how funding categorisation is being approached in the Project Catalyst funding process in Cardano. This work led us to realise the benefits of this type of analytical work and how it can be beneficial for ecosystems across the wider industry.

Other grants:
- We are applying to numerous other ecosystems with similar proposals. Any funding we receive will be made public in our documentation - https://docs.web3association.co/funding-received
