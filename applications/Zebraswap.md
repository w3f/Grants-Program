## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
Zebraswap is a peer-to-peer marketplace where transactions occur directly between crypto
traders. DEXs fulfill one of crypto’s core possibilities: fostering
financial transactions that aren’t officiated by banks, brokers, or
any other intermediary.
Unlike centralized exchanges, DEXs don’t allow for exchanges
between fiat and crypto — instead, they exclusively trade
cryptocurrency tokens for other cryptocurrency tokens. Offering
true decentralisation.
Decentralized exchanges are simply a set of smart contracts.
They establish the prices of various cryptocurrencies against
each algorithmically and use “liquidity pools” — in which
investors lock funds in exchange for interest-like rewards — to
facilitate trades.



### Overview

-A truly interoperable decentralised world.Welcome to the future of DEFI
-With the effective use of interoperable bridges, liquidity pools, and DEX aggregators we can tackle the liquidity dilemma along with providing cross-chain capabilities
-To tackle the bridge security issues many DEXs face, we will over collateralize these bridges to add an additional layer of security for the users
-The bridges are operated by a group of permissionless, decentralised bridge nodes that a re-elected every single month. These nodes collectively use a combination of
Secure Multipart Computation (sMPC) and Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to collectively generate signatures to secure cross-chain assets.
- The Dapp will live and thrive on the Polkadot ecosystem connecting all parachains and all evm compatible chains along with bridges to non-evm chains too. The Dapp will incorporate key parachains to boost interoperability in the Polkadot ecosystem.
-The team strongly believes that the future of DEFI is interoperable and we aim to do just that by leveraging the sophisticated Polkadot technology and systems.

### Project Details

-Along with enabling key yield farms and cross-chain liquidity pools we will be Building bridges, which use an advanced version of the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method
to transfer assets between blockchains. The bridges are direct bridges, meaning they require no intermediaries or relay networks to complete cross-chain transactions. Rather,
when moving assets from one blockchain to another, the assets are transferred directly from the source chain to the destination
chain. For example, when moving Bitcoin to Ethereum, the BTC is locked on the Bitcoin Network by the bridge nodes before wrapped BTC is minted on Ethereum. There is
no intermediary step or middlemen. The bridges are operated by a group of permissionless, decentralised bridge nodes
that a re-elected every single month. These nodes collectively use a combination of Secure Multipart Computation (sMPC) and
Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to collectively generate signatures to secure cross-chain assets. This approach is far more secure than the multisig approach used by many
other cross-chain bridges. Additionally, this approach ensures that no single node or entity ever has access to a user’s assets.


### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

-The project fits right into the heart of the ecosystem by enabling true decentralization and interoperability not only for the crypto asset but also by making NFTs on the chain truly interoperable.
- Our target audience is the entirety of the Polkadot ecosystems, including parachains, users, tokens, and NFT marketplaces.
- The Dapp meets a key need of fostering financial transactions that aren't officiated by banks, brokers, or any other intermediary. Along with making the ecosystem so flexible that other Dapps can also use these bridges to have a direct link to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- There is a handful of Dapp's on the Polkadot ecosystem all solving different purposes very efficiently however we aim to be different by:
  - Current similar Dapps  and their hurdles:
  - Current DEXs are not capable of supporting a wide range of cryptocurrencies due to the lack of liquidity and interoperability
  - Due to the increase in transaction load, the DEXs suffer from prolonged order matching time. As the order matching is automated, no human intervention can speed up things
  - The current interoperable bridge solutions being built in the market, provide a lack of safety for users and lack security as they are susceptible to hacks due to the lack of collateralisation.
How we aim to solve this
-With the effective use of interoperable bridges, liquidity pools, and DEX aggregators we can tackle the liquidity dilemma along with providing cross-chain capabilities
-Instead of using a normal order book method we will implement a smart AMM model to cut the prolonged matching time to practically zero.
-To tackle the bridge security issues many DEXs face, we will over collateralize these bridges to add an additional layer of security for the users

-React 
-Mongo DB


### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 150-180 Days  
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  5 FTFE
- **Total Costs:** 50,000 USD 

### Milestone 1 The Tech — Implement infrastructure along with bridges

- **Estimated duration:** 60-100  Days 
- **FTE:**  5
- **Costs:** 36000 USD

All of the  bridges are operated by a group of permissionless, decentralised bridge nodes that are re-elected every single month. These nodes collectively use a combination of Secure Multipart Computation (sMPC) and Shamir’s Secret Sharing (SSS) to collectively generate signatures to secure crosschain assets. This approach is far more secure than the multisig approach used by many other crosschain bridges. Additionally, this approach ensures that no single node or entity ever has access to a user’s assets.

The Zebraswap will bridges also support a number of non-EVM networks. This means that traditionally isolated assets like BTC, LTC, XRP and DOT, just to name a few, can be transferred to blockchains with vibrant DeFi ecosystems like Ethereum, Avalanche,  and Fantom, the list is endless. With Zebraswap we aim to do just that, by having a these vibrant ecosystems move over to our platform on polkadot.

How does this sMPC and SSS secure assets?: The crosschain bridge transfers assets and/or data from a source chain to a target chain. In its most basic form, this is usually done by locking an asset on the source chain and minting a wrapped asset of the same value on the target chain. We call this the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method. For the Lock-Mint-Burn-Unlock method to work, three main smart contracts are deployed: one on source chain to handle source assets, one on target chain to handle target assets, and one on a managing chain to handle registration and staking of bridge nodes. 

when the crosschain transaction is initiated by a user, the target chain and target address are specified. The source chain smart contract locks the source token and emits a Lock event. The bridge nodes detect the Lock event and instruct the target chain smart contract to mint a token of the same value on the target chain.

The secure multiparty computation provides a protocol where no individual can see the other parties data while distributing the data across multi parties. It enables movement of  data privately on the distributed data network without exposing it. Secret sharing is utilized as the basic tool when there is an honest majority in secure multiparty computation. A secret sharing scheme is that a secret s is shared among n parties, such that t+1 or more parties come together to reconstruct the secret. The parties lesser than t cannot get any information or reconstruct the secret. The scheme which fulfills the requirements of t+1 out of n is called the threshold secret sharing scheme.

## Future Plans

Our vision is to connect one chain at a time through our dex making it a go-to DEFI house. To make this happen we will be heavily focused on the key factors.

- Constant innovation through technology deployment and integrations
- Integration with key dapps on Polkadot as well as other blockchains for users to have a wider choice
-Community engagement is crucial for us and at the top of our priority: while we will be using a different array of business strategies not limiting to Bounty campaigns, Airdrops, Trading events, and press
Release, influencer onboarding, etc. We strongly believe in DIP: DIMO Improvement Proposals, where the community takes an active role in the development of the Dapp so that it becomes a Dapp that is for the community, by the community.

| Future update 1. | NFT Bridges | Facility for NFT swaps on the platform |
| Future update 2. | NFT x DEFI  | Features like staking, renting, and leasing NFTs on the platform 
| Future update 3. | Exchange Integrations | Integrating DEFI Aggregators and exchanges to boost liquidity and have the concept of "imported" liquidity pools.
