# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** DEIP IP Management/Governance Module
* **Proposer:** [aliakseikulik](https://github.com/aliakseikulik)
* **Payment Address:** bc1q6dnhvxt93rtdalrtgezzwtsn2krglktv68e7nr

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
DEIP builds an IP assets management platform which allows discovering, evaluation, and exchange of IP assets on the blockchain. It can be applied to any type of IP assets. The platform implements registration of IP assets on the blockchain, tokenization of IP assets, and governance of IP assets. With such infrastructure, DEIP becomes a foundation for DeFI and DAO around IP assets. In the future, DEIP will also provide a no-code/low code SDK to build custom Dapps for specific IP assets management cases (patents, art, movies, technologies, etc.).

#### Integration ####
DEIP is a Polkadot Parachain built on Substrate 2.0 Framework and designed specifically for IP governance, tokenization, and exchange. We see integration with Polkadot ecosystem as an important step towards a truly decentralized way to govern and exhange tokenized IP assets.

#### Motivation ####
DEIP team has been building a solutions for tokenization and exhange of IP assets since 2017. We have a vision of a more innovative world where individuals and companies are able to push their innovations to market faster and with less expenses.

We see Polkadot as a the best ecosystem for us to join. We believe that our protocol will be useful for other companies in the Polkadot ecosystem and even could drive adoption of both Polkadot and DEIP solutions.

### Project Details 

#### DEIP IP Management/Governance (IPMG) Module
IPMG is a core module for managing technology assets, and assessment and evaluation of IP assets. It enables a collaborative approach in the creation and governance of IP assets via working groups as DAOs, advanced access control & sharing capabilities with Proof of Share. Furthermore, the IPMG module enables a collaborative assessment and evaluation of IP assets via a Decentralized Assessment System that allows to crowdsource expertise from the network. Working groups are managed as DAOs via specific smart-contracts that create delayed transactions with multi-sig to be executed.

Within the scope of this grant we will implement a parachain and web-based UI with basic functionality for the management of working groups via DAOs, and governance and registration of IP on the blockchain. Core features to be implemented during this phase:
* Management of working groups (creation, membership management, decision-making mechanisms (voting));
* Creation of project(s);
* Creation of IP asset(s) within a project;
* Registration of IP asset(s) ownership on the blockchain with certification (a digital certificate that embeds a signature of IP asset creator, creation timestamp and hash of the certified IP asset);
* Access control (with Proof of Share);
* Ownership validation tool (a web-based tool used to verify the owner/creator of IP asset and creation timestamp using the provided certification data such as hash of IP asset or certified IP asset file);

## Future Plans

We are planning to continuusly evolve the project adding new modules and make a first decentralized exchnage for IP assets. 

#### IP Tokenization (IPT) module ####
IPT module enables securitization and tokenization of IP assets. It introduces advanced mechanics for the management of IP ownership, such as the distribution of shares of IP, co-ownership, and royalties distribution via smart-contracts.

#### IP Financing (IPF) module ####
IPF module provides various models of funding and financing for projects that produce IP assets. Funding models include (but not limited to): crowd investing, private investing, grants, open innovation (OI) challenges.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

* **What work has been done so far?**

We already have a working prototype and pilots.

* **Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?**

No

* **Have you applied for other grants so far?**

We have not applied for any other grants with this exact project. But we have applied for multiple grants related to the application of our Decentralized Assessment System (a system we designed for crowdsourcing of domain expertise to assess various IP assets). We are currently implementing pilots as part of Blockchers program, as well as part of EOSC Digital Innovation Hub.
