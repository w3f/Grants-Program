Therefore, it might lead to many inconveniences for the users such as funds being transferred to the wrong address. In contrast, traditional payment is usually based on human-readable identifiers (HRI) instead of random strings, and this is for a good reason. There are many application scenarios that require the payment to be based on one&#x27;s HRIs. When you pay your debts to your friends, you want the transaction record to be bound to your identity so that it can serve as proof later that your debt has been paid. Or if you take a business trip, you want your accommodation receipt to associate with your company&#x27;s identifier so that you can reimburse the cost later. If you go to a grocery store to buy some daily goods, you want the transaction record to have your own identity on it to prove to the grocery cashier you have paid the bill. As a matter of fact, you can find countless examples that demonstrate that it is preferable to have your payment based on HRIs instead of random addresses. Cryptocurrency has already brought fundamental change to the existing financial system and internet economy. The emerging Web 3.0 is starting to give the user back the ownership and control of their data. However, we believe to base the payment on HRIs instead of random blockchain addresses
remains a final mile to deliver before cryptocurrency and Web 3.0 truly become mainstream and finally take over our daily life.</p><p>We have seen novel solutions emerging from various blockchain ecosystems that try to base payment on HRIs. The <a href="https://www.pns.link/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot name system (PNS)</a> is a good example. However, most of these naming services focuses specifically on providing HRIs for the users of one single blockchain ecosystem and fails to bridge the users of the different ecosystems and hence are against the &quot;breaking the digital barriers&quot; ethos of Web 3.0. Most importantly, the new HRI system fails to incorporate many existing Web 2.0 human-readable identifiers that users are more comfortable using in practice, such as their various social media identities, email addresses (based on which PayPal systems are built), etc. We believe it is far more interesting to build a cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system that combines the users&#x27; existing Web 2.0 and Web 3.0 identifiers.</p><p>Different from the current internet economy that by and large is segmented by the digital wall garden erected by various internet monopoly companies, a cross-platform payment scheme will open up many interesting application scenarios that truly embody the spirit of Web 3.0. For instance, a Twitter user who doesn&#x27;t necessarily have a medium account, when he/she sees a medium article he/she likes, he/she can simply tip the article author from his/her Twitter account via our Faceless protocol. If a Facebook user watches an advertisement on an estate NFT from Decentraland, he/she can pay for the NFT directly from his/her Facebook account via Faceless. A cross-platform payment scheme based on a generic HRI system will not only serve the purpose of bringing Web 2.0 users into the Web 3.0 world but also taps into this immense market and helps realize the full potential of Web 3.0.</p><p>Another limit of existing HRI-based payment solutions is the lack of privacy. This is actually closely tied to another interesting application of Faceless protocol, i.e., regulatory-compliant payment. Due to the explosive growth of Web 3.0 payment and its application such as decentralized finance (DeFi), NFT, etc, traditional financial institution is starting to migrate to Web 3.0. However, in order for the Cryptocurrency market to attract institutional money on a large scale, one has to address its regulatory concerns. The privacy issue is likely to play a central part in the regulatory compliance requirements. This has been demonstrated when Meta (previously Facebook) tried to launch its own cryptocurrency Diem (previously Libra). The most widely raised regulatory compliance issue of Diem during the senate hearing is the privacy issue \cite{Libra_privacy1,Libra_privacy2}. Faceless will provide a private payment scheme based on HRI and hence resolve the privacy issue.</p><p>Our protocol will become a fierce competitor in the sphere of regulatory-compliant payment. In the traditional banking system, whenever a client tries to open a bank account, the first thing the bank staff will ask for is his/her identity card as the client&#x27;s identity is the foundation of regulation-compliant operations. In the Web 3.0 world, the HRIs will serve as the basis of regulatory-compliant finance. Faceless satisfies two vital requirements of regulatory compliance: 1. HRI will serve as the basis of regulatory compliance, 2. our payment solution will be private, which addresses a central issue in any regulatory-compliance requirement. One&#x27;s HRIs such as social media accounts or PNS account can serve as the foundation to implement various regulation-compliant operations such as anti-money laundering. More sophisticated applications such as trusted decentralized finance (DeFi) can also be built on top of our system. For instance, one could build a credit system or lending and borrowing system based on one&#x27;s HRIs.</p><p>Global Web 3.0 blockchain market revenue is estimated to reach 87 billion US dollars by 2030 \cite{Web3.0_market_size}, and the Web 3.0 payment revenue will be an 18 billion USD market. Even Faceless only takes ten percent of the Web 3.0 payment market, its revenue should be close to 2 billion USD. The growth potential for Faceless is limitless.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-project-architecture">1. Project Architecture<a href="#1-project-architecture" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 1. Project Architecture" title="Direct link to 1. Project Architecture">​</a></h4><p>In the web 3.0 world, the tokens should be transferred directly between the HRIs while the blockchain addresses serve a role similar to the bank accounts
that are the portal of the tokens in the blockchain layer flowing in and out of these accounts. The relationship between the HRIs and blockchain addresses
is similar to bank accounts and payment accounts such as Paypal accounts, Wechat accounts, or Alipay accounts. A user can own a Paypal account, Wechat
account, or Alipay account, all of which are tied to the bank accounts. In our case, the HRI accounts will process all the daily transactions that are usually small-amount and high-frequency, while the blockchain address will be used for depositing and withdrawing large-amount and low-frequency tokens from the HRI accounts. The general idea of our architecture is shown in the figure.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/lornacrevelingwgo23/img/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-22%20at%2014.44.22.png" alt="" width="70%" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Our scheme is based on identity-based encryption. The idea of identity-based encryption \cite{Shamir84} was proposed by Adi Shamir as a replacement for the traditional public-key encryption scheme, which requires a public key infrastructure to verify the correspondence between a public key and the user&#x27;s real identity. In an identity-based encryption scheme, the user&#x27;s identity is treated as one&#x27;s public key, and a user with a secret key corresponding to the respective identity can be used to decrypt the ciphertext encrypted under the respective identity. In other words, instead of using a random string as the user&#x27;s public key, the IBE system treats HRI as the user&#x27;s public key. Another interesting feature of the IBE system is that there exists a master key that can be used to derive as many as necessary secret keys corresponding to different identities. This feature enables a user in our proposed scheme to use a master key to derive multiple secret keys to manage the private payment of multiple HRIs. A layer-2 private payment scheme based on the IBE scheme will generate the ciphertext for the transferred balance under the receiver&#x27;s identity, which could be any HRI owned by the receiver. Since the encryption is directly tied to the users&#x27; identity, this will eliminate the need for an extra substrate pallet to manage the connection between the public key and HRIs.</p><p>At a high level, our framework shares certain similarities with the Zether scheme. To guarantee the confidentiality of the transferred amount, the transferred amount will be encrypted under the receiver&#x27;s identity and homomorphically added to the receiver&#x27;s ciphertext. The ciphertext of the transferred amount will be accompanied by a zero-knowledge proof showing the payment consistency etc. Since the main focus of our scheme is to protect the privacy of layer-2 payments between different HRIs, we can guarantee the privacy of the identifiers as long as the underlying encryption scheme can guarantee the privacy of the underlying identities. This is why we require the underlying IBE scheme to be anonymous, which implies that no useful information on the identity can be deduced from the ciphertext. Note each layer-1 account will manage one single set of public parameters and master key, which can be used to generate and manage multiple secret keys for multiple HRIs. However, both the registration of public parameters in the substrate pallet and the subsequent operations of the account does not reveal any useful information to help the adversary infer the underlying HRIs.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="2--preliminaries">2.  Preliminaries<a href="#2--preliminaries" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 2.  Preliminaries" title="Direct link to 2.  Preliminaries">​</a></h4><p>2.1 Zether framework</p><p>The Zether framework \cite{bunz2019zether} and its variants \cite{SuterusuWP,SuterusuWebsite,tornado,AztecWP} require a user to select a secret key and register a corresponding layer-2 public key in the substrate pallet.
The substrate pallet initializes the user&#x27;s layer-2 account with encryption of 0. Here the encryption algorithm is the homomorphic Elgamal encryption scheme. The user can then fund the account by homomorphic adding b tokens to the encrypted balance. The tokens can also be transferred between two layer-2 accounts, the user needs to generate two ciphertexts of the transferred amount for both the sender and receiver&#x27;s public keys respectively. Zether employs a zero-knowledge proof scheme to prove that the two ciphertexts encrypt the same amount and the remaining sender balance after the sent amount deduced from the original account is still positive. To guarantee the anonymity of the involved sender and receiver public keys, the Zether framework adopts a one-our-of-many zero-knowledge proof scheme to ensure the sender and receiver&#x27;s public keys are hidden among the public keys of anonymity set. The Zether framework also provides a mechanism to prevent the front-running and replay attacks, which we also adopt in this work.</p><p>2.2 Anonymous IBE (AIBE) with homomorphic property</p><p>The following <code>AIBE</code> scheme is a variant of the identity-based encryption proposed by Boneh and Franklin \cite{BonehF03}, that has homomorphic property with regard to identical identities. An identity-based encryption scheme usually consists of four algorithms: <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= Setup(\lambda)" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> takes the security parameter <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= \lambda" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> as inputs and outputs the master key <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= msk" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> and corresponding public parameter <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= para" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q">, which includes the corresponding public key <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= mpk" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q">. <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= Extract(ID, msk)" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> generates a secret key <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= SK_{\mbox{ID}}" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> corresponding to an identity <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= ID" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> using the master secret key <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= msk" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q">.

It guarantees zero-knowledge property, which implies no efficient verifier can learn anything more than the validity of the statement. It also guarantees soundness, which prevents an adversary from producing valid proof of a statement without knowing the corresponding secret. We use similar notations for zero-knowledge proof as in Zether. Our zero-knowledge proof system has three algorithms (<code>ZKP.Setup</code>, <code>Prove</code>, <code>ZKP.Verify</code>), where <code>ZKP.Setup</code> takes security parameters as inputs and outputs public parameters. <code>Prove</code> takes as a witness of a statement as inputs and outputs a proof for the statement. <code>ZKP</code>.<code>Verify</code> checks if the proof is valid with respect to the statement. We will adopt the <a href="https://github.com/zeropoolnetwork/zeropool-substrate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ZeroPool</a> library to implement our ZKP algorithms.</p><p>Digital signature is also a vital building block. It consists of the following algorithms (<code>Sig</code>.<code>Setup</code>, <code>Sign</code>, <code>Sig</code>.<code>Verify</code>). It follows the same definition as in Zether.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-our-scheme">3. Our scheme<a href="#3-our-scheme" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Our scheme" title="Direct link to 3. Our scheme">​</a></h4><p>3.1 Setup</p><p><code>Setup</code> (Fig. \ref{Fig:setup}). The setup algorithm calls <code>AIBE</code>.<code>Setup</code>, <code>ZKP</code>.<code>Setup</code> and <code>Sig</code>.<code>Setup</code> as subroutines, which are the setup algorithms for the AIBE scheme, the zero-knowledge proof system and the digital signature scheme, respectively. The setup method also initializes account tables acc and pending transfers table pTransfers, and a variable <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= b_{\mbox{total}}" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> that tracks the total amount of tokens held by the pallet. The setup also specifies an epoch length E, a maximum amount value MAX and the maximum size of identifier set IM under the management of one master public key.</p><p>3.2 User algorithms</p><p>A user will use a master secret key $msk$ to manage multiple identities. A user runs one of the following algorithms to interact with the pallet. The outputs of these algorithms are raw transactions.</p><p>User algorithms</p><p><code>CreateAccount</code>($1^\lambda$)($msk$, $mpk$) takes the security parameter $\lambda$ as input and outputs a master secret key $msk$ and the respective master public key $mpk$.</p><p><code>CreateFundTx</code>($mpk$, $i<em>{\mbox{ID}}$, $amt$, $\mbox{ID}$) adds funds to an identifier $\mbox{ID}$ with $amt$ tokens under the management of the master public key $mpk$. It outputs $tx</em>{\mbox{fund}}$.</p><p><code>CreateTransferTx</code>($msk<em>{from}$, $mpk</em>{to}$, $amt$, $st$, $\mbox{ID}$, $i<em>{\mbox{ID}}$, $\bar{\mbox{ID}}$, $i</em>{\bar{\mbox{ID}}}$) transfers money from one identifier $\mbox{ID}$ under the management of $mpk<em>{from}$ to the other identifier $\bar{\mbox{ID}}$ under the management of $mpk</em>{to}$. It takes a secret key $msk<em>{from}$, a destination public key $mpk</em>{to}$, an amount $amt$, and the state of the pallet $st$, the sender identifier $\mbox{ID}$ and the respective index $i<em>{\mbox{ID}}$, the receiver identifier $\bar{\mbox{ID}}$ and the respective $i</em>{\bar{\mbox{ID}}}$ at a certain block height $h$ as inputs. It outputs $tx_{trans}$.</p><p><code>CreateBurnTx</code>($msk$, $\mbox{ID}$, $i<em>{\mbox{ID}}$, $st$) withdraws the entire balance from an account. It takes a secret key $msk$ and a state $st$ as inputs. It outputs $tx</em>{\mbox{burn}}$.  </p><p><code>ReadBalance</code>($msk$, $st$) reads the balance of an account. It takes a secret key $msk$ and state $st$ as inputs, and outputs an integer $b$.</p><p>Note since we intend to keep the identifiers $<!-- -->{<!-- -->\mbox{ID}<!-- -->}<!-- -->$ under the management of $mpk$ secret, whenever a new identifier is registered under $mpk$, a new index will be assigned to the corresponding identity, which will be denoted as $i<em>{\mbox{ID}}$. The set of identifiers under the management of $mpk$ will be denoted as $\mbox{ID}</em>{mpk}$. Only the index of the identifier will be transferred publicly.</p><p>To protect the user anonymity and amount confidentiality, our scheme needs to invoke zero-knowledge proof as the sub-routine. The statements of the zero-knowledge proof are specified as follows:</p><p>Let (${C<em>{{\rm{ID}},1}}$,${C</em>{{\rm{ID}},2}}$) be the encryption
of balance for ID under $mpk=y=g^s$. The pallet needs to deduct b<em>from ID&#x27;s balance and add the same amount to $\overline {{\rm{ID}}}$&#x27;s balance, which will be put into a pending state. Since we need to hide b</em> in this process, user will encrypt b* under both ($mpk=y$, ID), and ($\overline{mpk}=\overline{y}$, $\overline {{\rm{ID}}} $) to get ($C_1$, $C_2$) and ($C_1$, ${\bar C}_2$), respectively. Now, it must provide a proof to show that:</p><ol><li>both ciphertexts are well formed and encrypt the same value b*;</li><li>b* is a positive value; and,</li><li>the remaining balance of ID, say b&#x27;, is positive too.</li></ol><p>More formally, a user proves the following statement <img loading="lazy" src="&lt;http://chart.googleapis.com/chart?cht=tx&amp;chl&gt;= st_{transfer}" style="border:none" class="img_ev3q"> for the transfer operation:</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/lornacrevelingwgo23/img/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-21%20at%2016.56.15.png" alt="" width="50%" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The following is the statement for the burning transaction, i.e., $st<em>{burn}$. The statement shows that the user knows a valid secret key $s{k</em>{{\rm{ID}}}}$ with respect to the public parameters of the AIBE scheme and the identity ID, and (${C<em>{{\rm{ID}},1}},{C</em>{{\rm{ID}},2}}$) is a valid encryption of $b$ for ID.</p><p align="center"><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/lornacrevelingwgo23/img/blob/main/Screenshot%202022-05-21%20at%2016.56.32.png" alt="" width="50%" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>3.3 Substrate pallet</p><p>Our substrate pallet has three main functions <code>Fund</code>, <code>Transfer</code>, and <code>Burn</code>. They take $tx<em>{\mbox{fund}}$, $tx</em>{\mbox{trans}}$, and $tx_{\mbox{burn}}$ as inputs respectively. These functions check whether the inputs are valid by verifying a proof or checking a nonce. If any of these checks fail, the function outputs 0.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-interest">Team Interest<a href="#team-interest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team Interest" title="Direct link to Team Interest">​</a></h4><p>The Faceless Protocol team consists of senior cryptographers, engineers and startup founders.

We will also implement the AIBE scheme and integrate the Faceless protocol with the Polkadot ecosystem. Furthermore, we will also build a substrate pallet that integrates the verification logic of the associated zero-knowledge proof and provide the necessary UI for the users to interact with all these algorithms to launch the private payment for HRIs.

This is the only way to truly tie the payment to the application scenario and push the Web 3.0 payment to the broader users. The HRI-based payment will serve the purpose of bringing the Web 2.0 users to the Web 3.0 world. Polkadot is at the forefront of Web 3.0, and it has been the pioneer in establishing the standard for Web 3.0 DID. A private payment scheme for HRI is a perfect fit for the Polkadot ecosystem. It will facilitate the wider deployment and usage of Web 3.0 DID, especially by satisfying the need of those privacy-conscious users. It will protect the payment privacy of the users when they enjoy the convenience of HRI-based payment and potentially introduce them to many interesting applications of HRI-based private payment such as regulation-compliant private payment, etc.</p><p>We have known a few existing private payment schemes for the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Raze or Manta networks. However, none of these private payment schemes is specifically designed for HRIs, and it&#x27;s not clear how they can easily adapt their scheme to the case of HRIs. There exist many payment schemes outside of the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Tornado.cash, Aztec, and Suterusu. However, none of these payment schemes are designed for HRIs either. There also exists a few other schemes that try to either connect Web 2.0 users to the Web 3.0 world such as CyberConnect or naming services such as PNS and ENS, which can serve as a foundation for an HRI-based payment scheme. However, neither of them provides any private payment solution, which is technically challenging.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team Members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team Members" title="Direct link to Team Members">​</a></h3><ul><li><a href="https://medium.com/@lh-76196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Heisenberg lin</a> - Applied cryptographer.</li><li>Michelle Han - Chief Marketing Officer.</li><li>Zico Huang - Cryptography engineer.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li>Faceless Technology Ltd. is a company registered in the BVI.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-experience">Team Experience<a href="#team-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team Experience" title="Direct link to Team Experience">​</a></h3><p><strong>Heisenberg lin</strong>  </p><p>Ph.D, degrees in Applied cryptography and privacy-preserving distributed systems from SJTU and UFL.
