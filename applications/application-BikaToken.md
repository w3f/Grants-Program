### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
Bika Token is a project more than Defi and has a wider reach that focuses on novels and games.
- A brief description of your project.

What is Bika Token?

Bika Token (BKT) is a token  that functions as payment and reward for writers and novel readers on the Bika Novel platform that will be coming soon. We created this token with the aim of increasing the creativity of writers as well as producing talented writers. Everyone can join our platform, bolt novice writers and professional writers. Because we really deal with all work and they deserve to be rewarded according to the work they create. If the token was created to answer the concerns pf the writers due to very little income and very difficult payment. We are hare to make all that easier with a decentralized system.


Why Bika Token was Created?

Bika Token (BKT) was created to give more appreciation to novel lovers and give full support to writers to work and get appropriate rewards, We value each work and give appropriate prizes for each work, We provide a great opportunity for everyone to continue to work and get and award that is in accordance whit his work.


What is Bika Novel?

Bika Novel is an online novel platform created as a place for writers to work to 

increase their creativity and also get prizes for novel lovers who can read online novels easily and at relatively affordable prices and in the future we will present an NFT market where everyone can participate in in it and sell digital works. Every work published on Bika Novel will get an exclusive contract where the author is not allowed to publish his work on platforms other than Bika Novel. Each author who has concluded an exclusive contract will become Bika Token/USDT while still including the author's name as the copyright of the owner of the work. If someone commits fraud or plagiarism so that is not original in the Bika Novel application and it is declared correct to do so, then we will freeze the account within a few months or even permanently. If user’s account commits fraud or plagiarism, he want to reactive his account then must pay a final 10 % to 20% depending the fraud. But if the user doesn’t want to active his account and let us freeze the maximum 1 year after 1 year has passed, the remaining balance in our frozen account will be used to buy back Bika Token and burn it. If there is an agency or company that wants the author's work and turns it into a book, film, drama, electronic cinema, we will give 60% of the income to the author and 40% of the income we will use to buy back Bika Token and burn Bika Token on a regular basis. In the Bika Token application, we will provide a BKT/USDT pair to make it easier to buy and sell Bika Tokens.


Goals and how to achieve them?

Goal Bika token was created to give freedom and get results from readers and novel writers, I will create an online Novel platform with a defi wallet system and Nft Marketplace.  I strive to create and develop web applications and wallet development with good partners and I will change lives for the better with crypto.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant).
The Bika Token team wants a long term project, the Want Bika token team has its own value and successfully launched this new idea, as a leader I want to make this project not inferior to the Metaverse Project which is currently booming, and has many users and is on the exchange.

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
The project will issue Dapps for exchange and will be listed in the top 3 Exchange markets, UI design like Dapps in general, take Bika Novel UI and games.
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
Dapps, and the Polkadot protocol as a means for project deployment and development.
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
Bika Novel and Bika Swap are still under development and manufacture.
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
It doesn't have a centralized exchange, it doesn't have its own blockchain.
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
I hope my project sells well in the market and has a high asset value, I hope that polkadot can help realize and assist funding up to level 2 so that the project gets sufficient funds for development and in-depth research on new innovations in crypto.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:
We haven't migrated to Polkadot yet due to financial problems, the project requires initial funding for development and migrated to Polkadot.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
Our software uses windows 11 and has software from android studio, Unreal engine 4, data processing, rust processing, Ui design software, testing program.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
10000 USD 
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
The project will buy a filw to upload for reference for the community and developers.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
If it takes 5 months at most to complete an early stage project with few workers, then this sounds long but we are speeding up the duration to quickly launch an early stage project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
5 FTe
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).
N/A
> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
1 year
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
2 FTE
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
