### Overview

Bika Token is a project that uses a defi system on a novel and processes encoding on a substrate and uses a polka-dot network as a defense for explorers, the project issues its own Swap running on the substrate using a polka-dot network.  we will develop new innovations thoroughly in the polkadot ecosystem, with a system that is easier and can be applied scientifically, and create a masterpiece game made for game development and a new generation, Bika as part of the Substrate / Kusama / Polkadot / Ecosystem  Web 3.

•Bika is used as a reader payment application and writes a novel.

•Bika Swap As an exchange of ethereum tokens, Bep20 and polkadot, with a decentralized system, coding and resources from the substrate.

•Bika Novel is an online novel platform created as a place for writers to work to increase their creativity and also get prizes for novel lovers who can read online novels easily and at relatively affordable prices and in the future we will present an NFT market where everyone can participate in in it and sell digital works.

•The Bika Ecosystem, provides happiness and passion for users and lovers of readers and writers to create a work, and the token is used as a tool and user asset and as an exchange token for Bika and other multi-chain, new innovation Blockchain, with a coding and transparent system, can  providing users and developers with future benefits and new innovations in crypto.

•Extensible to integrate with data analytics, knowledge visualization, and algorithm engines.

•And can be used by users and industry players for development and innovation and improve existing in all coding.

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).

Bika is an okay Novel platform with the crypto world's first defi system with a wide ecosystem and Nft marektplece for NFT trading.

- A brief description of your project.

Bika Token (BKT) is a platform that functions as payment and reward for writers and novel readers on the Bika Novel platform that will be coming soon, We created this token with the aim of increasing the creativity of writers as well as producing talented writers, Everyone can join our platform, novice writers and professional writers, Because we literally handle all the work and they deserve to be rewarded according to the work they create, If the token is created to address the concerns of the authors due to very small income and very difficult payments, We want to make all that easier with a decentralized system.
•The Bika ecosystem includes Dapps and novel and Nft platforms, with all this knowledge and development able to benefit the Literacy industry and writers and creative industries. 
•Bika runs and has strong resources of substrate and web3 development, all of Bika's goal is to help others to achieve their goals and their creativity is rewarded on the platform and rewarded, for new development and innovation in crypto and finance world.

- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.

Explanation of the relationship with Polkadot, web3, Kusama and substrate, Bika will run on the polkadot Blockchain exploration and make Dapps development through the substrate for Swap with the Polkadot Ethereum network and Bep20, with development on Ethereum is a network and high transaction fees we try to enter to  polkadot network for a cheaper fee for users, by using this ethereum system we can develop it.

- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

I see that many other projects are imitating and developing the Metaverse project, we here think that following the creation of such a project will fail because of the high interest in the development, so here we want to try creative innovations for technological and Crypto advancement, this project has the opportunity to advance  like metaverse and Nft.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

Backup for users and assets for novel platform and decentralized Dapps exchange, Bika Mvp project ie web based application Dapps, Bika novel application(online Novel application with Defi system) and games for insight development and entertainment for users, build multi chain dapps with network  polkadot and ethereum, Open source government to develop, as an opening idea for the project wanted to provide an update of the Bika project, providing easy-to-use coding. as a foundation for future development and development of Blockchain itself.

- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement

The project has innovation and creative industries, all of which will provide good services and facilities for development on web3, Bika is working to provide change to Web3 and cryptocurrency, all running with the polkadot ecosystem.

- This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Using good technology and software for project development Bika will realize creative ideas and build Dapps with substrate and polka dots, I hope this grant program helps Bika project finance to realize quality products, good resources and tools for development is the goal for funding to get  useful requirement for project purpose, Bika Token is an online Novel project based on Defi and NFT, all will run on web3 and use polkadot network for dapps development and provide new parian innovation in web3.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The Bika project will build Dapps with ethereum and polkadot networks and use Substrate as a Dapps web processing and development, build a strong community with polkadot, and the Bika Novel application as an Innovation from Web3.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

The target market is Dapps and the novel industry and readers and writers or the use of the Bika novel platform, most of us think the target for the Bika novel application, and will automatically feel exchanging their assets in our own dapps Or polkadot token exchange and ethereum on BikaSwap. And To gamers who want to play games that are in the survival horror genre, users who like scary games, jump scares and an uplifting storyline, these are all target markets for the production of Bika and Bika studio.

- What need(s) does your project meet?

Needs that have been met, namely a very compact team that supports each other, resources, tools, good ideas, careful strategy and planning, latest business models.  what have not been met are the small number of team members, a lot of work and development, finance for start-up capital (start-up funds are the key to their success with creative ideas for a project).

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

We hereby convey that the Bika project is a new innovation in crypto and there is no project like ours in the Blockchain and polka dot ecosystem, substrate or kusama, our project is a unique idea and sounds interesting and has ideas for growth.  

- If so, how is your project different?

The Bika project is a project that carries an online novel with an extensive system and has a defi and NFT system inside, this is a unique and latest innovation in crypto.

- If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

There are no similar projects to ours but our big rivals are Metaverse, defi and NFT etc projects.  These are rivals with almost the same business model but different but they have a lot of fans and I try to innovate new ones in order to give high response and good interest from use, projects like this (metaverse) are a big challenge to conquer.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

The software used is the project system and solidity from Ethereum, Android studio for Android applications, substrate for Dapps development, Unreal wind use for PC and console games. Apache OpenWhisk is an open source distributed Serverless platform that performs (fx) functions in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages infrastructure, servers, and scaling using Docker containers. The OpenWhisk platform supports a programming model in which developers write functional logic (called Actions), in any supported programming language, which can be dynamically scheduled and executed in response to related events (via Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or from HTTP requests.

- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
2,000 USD 

- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

This is the end user facing component to utilize the workflow. This component comprises of a backend application which is responsible for user registration, selecting the workflow, managing / creating workflow using friendly APIs, providing input parameters. API gateway / Machine gateway where the external world can connect to the Bika system.

- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.

Presentation for development for preparation of qualified resources and tools or software, due diligence will be carried out when the program is complete and Beta version upgrade to version 1 or final and a brief description of the work unit program and Repos code.

- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

Docker Files to transmit data and milestone files to develop, the project has a lot of development traffic and defense and security systems.

- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.

The duration of achievement is 12 months Or FTE the time it takes and 3 workers to do it.

- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

Milestones are developments that are still in progress and don't have any shareable code yet.

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
