## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- QSTN is a web application where users participate in surveys, quizzes and short questionnaires to earn virtual credit. 
- QSTN is a blockchain enabled market research portal where users answer questions, earn credit and spend these rewards in our digital marketplace for tokenized goods (e.g. NFTs, metaverse wearables). 
	
When we agree to terms and conditions, most of the time, our data gets sold and commodified without permission or compensation. QSTN acts as an “interface” for consumers to pay gate their information towards businesses.

By compensating users for their data, we provide incentive for rich and meaningful insights. This information is then sold and accessed by our partners for market research purposes.

Since winning the Octopus Network Star Prize, we realize the importance of interoperability and the low transactional fees offered by Substrate due to their sharded blockchain mechanism; Octopus Network is supporting our app-chain. 
			
-  Building on this, we would like Polkadot to be the next blockchain we implement; allowing its users to answer questionnaires, earn virtual credit and spend it for digital rewards minted and issued on Polkadot (e.g. NFTs). 

The key to our platform is allowing users to monetize their personal information in a low gas, scalable environment and Polkadot meets both of these requirements. By supporting this initiative, the Web3 Foundation is investing in data infrastructure for the entire DOT ecosystem as well as creating a new “Play-to-Earn” model for data aggregation.

For scope, QSTN can be broken down into three different user experiences:
			1. User experience - general users create an account, complete on-boarding process and then have the ability to answer 5 daily questions in return for credit which can be spent within our NFT marketplace

			2. Business experience - businesses and corporate entities (e.g. DAOs and protocols) can establish an account to create their own questionnaire portal, reward users for their participation and track response rate 

			3. Commission experience - businesses and corporate entities can pay a fee to have their questions slipped into the "User View" rotation and glean insights from our daily, active audience for their own market research purposes
			
We want to bring all three user experiences to the DOT ecosystem, supporting the general user in scope 1, businesses and protocols who want to manage their own questionnaire in scope 2 and the opportunity for more traditional Web2 businesses to collect market research from Web3 audiences in scope 3.

- Founded by NYU graduate Orrin Campbell, QSTN was birthed by a recorded conversation with astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. During the interview, Neil argued that even if software is ‘free’, companies still profit from the sale, transfer, and storage of our information. 

For example, did you know Google makes almost $120 million dollars a day in advertising revenue (e.g. targeted ads, placements)? Orrin thought about how to creatively address this problem and deliver his “promise to save the world.”

Orrin has released NFTs with Mintbase, spoken on Cryptovoxels and Somnium panels as well as created a large social following behind his afrofuturistic aesthetic. 

Completing the QSTN team triad are the Suriel brothers, who Orrin met at NYU. Jose Suriel is an NYU graduate who handles project management at Forge AI — bringing this expertise to assisting the development and timeline of the QSTN marketplace.

Anibal Suriel is Jose’s twin brother and our head of legal, he is registered in New York and Miami; leveraging his time at KARM to create the legal framework and guidelines around data, compliance, and overall best practices.

With a desire to build meaningful products and experiences, Orrin founded QSTN with the aim to empower internet users and provide alternative means of passive income, aided by the invaluable expertise of the notorious Suriel duo.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components 
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- QSTN is Web3 infrastructure to accelerate the adoption of data monetization. Since users can earn with or without a Web3 wallet, but have the option to create one, shows we are designed to be a Web2 on-ramp into the world of Web3.

We aim to do this by taking advantage of the low gas, scalable environment offered on DOT to allow users to earn credits, mint NFTs and transfer assets without exorbitant transactional fees. 

Our design is a centralized system “wrapped” with Web3 extensions to that users can sign up using Twitter and FB, begin earning and interacting and as soon as they request a Web3 functionality we offer them the chance to create a wallet. 

- Right now, our target audience can be broken down in the following groups:
1. Data privacy enthusiasts (Web2 and Web3)
2. High school and college students seeking additional income 
3. Web3 DAOs and Protocols which need to capture market research (e.g. DAO governance) 
4. Web2 users wishing to matriculate to Web3 but no upfront capital or resources to get into the space

Currently, we have over 2,000 sign-ups for the waitlist, confirmed private test sessions with Encode Club, Octopus Network and a couple projects on NEAR Protocol as well as set aside a marketing budget for customer acquisition (200K total reach).

Since we also have a desire to partner with Web2 organizations to help demonstrate the value of our platform, we are currently in talks with the following educational institutions to run private sessions.
- Jack & Jill of America, Inc.
- New York University
- The Gray Matter Experience
			
- Our platform is able to act as a Web3 on-ramp because our design easily onboards novice, less experienced internet users. This is important because in our initial feedback, we learned a lot of internet users want to get into blockchain but do not have the capital, resources or know where to start.

We were inspired by the Pi app, as well as Sweatcoin which are two “Play-to-Earn” models where users get rewarded for daily, micro tasks based on actions taken in-platform.

QSTN builds on their concept by offering more exciting, engaging rewards, increasing the educational value behind our mission statement as well as creating a cohesive community for participants in our network (e.g. NFTs, metaverse)

- There are currently no other projects similar to ours in the Substrate ecosystem. However, we do see a potential partnership with Ocean Protocol as we can sell and aggregate our data profiles within their primary market. 
			
  - There are no other Web3 data market research portals but similar Web2 solutions include Google Form, Nielsen and Survey Monkey; the problem is this agencies do not have blockchain infrastructure currently in place.

Even if they did, we will be using game mechanics and "play-to-earn" models which will accelerate user adoption and data collection as we find the perfect incentive model using tokenized rewards. 

Our unique offering is the ability for Web2 users to answer questions, earn credits and buy NFTs within a "gas-less" environment but having the option to connect their wallet and mint once familiar with the technology.

We have spent the past year participating in over 5 accelerators to help drive the brand awareness within the Web3 space and ensure we become the "go-to" market research portal in blockchain. 

  - There has been an increase in the “Play-to-Earn” model and a couple players who are making noise in the space would include Rabbit Hole (educational), NEAR Crowd (micro task), Axie Infinity (gaming), Pi (validation), and Sweat Coin (exercise). 

We see a market opportunity to use this model for data aggregation, gamifying marketing research and then selling this information to corporate sponsors who offer digital goods or discounts to our users.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 3 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  5 employees (2 developers, 2 designers, 1 blockchain architect [Orrin])
- **Total Costs:** 50,000 USD

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

- **Estimated duration:** 3
- **FTE:**  6 employees
- **Costs:** 50,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Proprietary | We filed patents for our data monetization method within the US, UK, Portugal, Switzerland, and Germany. While the overarching code for the web application cannot be licensed, we will open source the smart contract code being used for the blockchain timestamp, NFT purchase, Polkadot.JS wallet creation and Polkadot.JS wallet log-in
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can generate a Polkadot.JS wallet during on boarding, connect this wallet to our web application, mint and/or transfer NFTs from our marketplace to that DOT wallet, and create a blockchain timestamp “receipt” as proof of their data monetization. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish a Medium article that documents our migration to Polkadot, the functions we have enabled including: wallet sign-in, wallet creation option, Polkadot NFT marketplace and blockchain timestamp function available to all existing users as well as the entire DOT community. 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will allow users to create a “timestamp” on the DOT blockchain which serves as a “receipt” each time users answer questions and earn credits 
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will give users the option to create a Polkadot.JS wallet during the on-boarding process to our platform or later connect an existing wallet to their account 
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will allow users to purchase, mint and transfer digital collectibles from our NFT marketplace which we will implement on the Polkadot blockchain
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way to create a unique on-boarding experience for first time users to generate a DOT wallet [Y], connect their wallet once created [Y] and then mint NFTs on the Polkadot blockchain - transferring them to their newly created (or pre-existing) wallet(s) if they so please [Z]. 

Upon completion of questionnaire, users have the option to connect create or connect a pre-existing DOT wallet [Y] and confirm their completion on-chain as a blockchain transaction “timestamp” [X]

## Future Plans

Please include here

- In the short term, we are competing in hackathons to better our understanding of Web3 products and services we can use to scale out the QSTN market research portal. 

Particularly, we will be participating in the Filecoin Sustainable Blockchain Summit Hackathon, Encode x Chainlink Hackathon and submitting for a couple accelerator programs which include VC pitching. 

In conjunction with our hacking and education, we will be testing our existing application privately with different companies ranging from Encode Club, Filecoin, Octopus Network, NEAR Protocol to Ocean Protocol. 

- Looking towards the future, we are excited to host our first NFT launch event on NEAR Protocol (August) and work with more traditional Web2 businesses in music, entertainment and market research to onboard the next million users into Web3
