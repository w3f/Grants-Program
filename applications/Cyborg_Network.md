### Overview

Cyborg Network is aimed at pioneering a novel approach to decentralized cloud computing within the Polkadot Ecosystem by establishing a marketplace that harnesses crowdsourced infrastructure. As a premier venture of this nature in the Polkadot landscape, our network effortlessly allows providers to integrate their machines, rewarding them for their invaluable participation.

We actively oversee the provider machines, leveraging them as servers to cater to diverse customer demands, ensuring their specifications are met seamlessly.

Our primary focus rests on delivering bespoke service packages, each meticulously crafted for different deployment scenarios. Our objective is to offer users a service experience reminiscent of the Web 2.0 era. While our foundation is anchored in decentralized cloud solutions, our long-term vision is set on transitioning towards a decentralized edge, especially as we delve into the flourishing AI and IoT age.

We are embarking on an ambitious mission to establish ourselves as a Polkadot and Kusama parachain. Our decision is anchored in several key reasons:

First, we're enticed by their advanced interoperable features, such as shared security and XCM. These functionalities pave the way for seamless integrations with other projects within the ecosystem.

Second, the unparalleled ecosystem and technical support provided by Polkadot and Kusama have been instrumental in our development, and we've had the privilege of closely collaborating with them over the years.

Lastly, the substrate framework stands out as the premier tool for crafting blockchains from the ground up in today's landscape. Our commitment to excellence aligns with the capabilities it offers.

### Project Details

#### Architecture:

The core of our computing solution relies on both off-chain components and substrate pallets that work harmoniously with each other.

![IoT Devices (1920 × 1250 px)](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/Grants-Program/assets/93442895/84f62d3a-d53a-4531-af86-498acaf6cbba)

Our system invites users to download and run our Cyborg Smart Client (CSC) binary as a root, allowing them to become a provider within our network seamlessly. Upon activation, the CSC immediately establishes a WebSocket connection with CyberHub—our sophisticated backend server and event handler. CyberHub not only serves as an oracle for our substrate blockchain but also links to a dedicated database containing all crucial business data. While these components start off centralized, we're strategically planning to transition them to decentralized structures after ensuring our business model operates flawlessly in such an environment.

We've embedded all operational logic within our pallets. Through the Cyborg Connect platform Dapp, which is integrated with our blockchain, customers have direct access to enact actions on the hosted machine. Both providers and customers can utilize our platform to view detailed analytics and metrics pertaining to their instances.

Initially, our goal is to configure the system to support predefined static instances, notably blockchain nodes. Our vision then expands to embracing custom deployments for applications and storage. By evolving in this manner, we aspire to establish ourselves as the premier decentralized computing hub for Polkadot ecosystem projects. Leveraging this infrastructure, we intend to develop transformative products such as:

- A Decentralized Postgres Database
- Decentralized CDN
- Decentralized Personal Drive Storage

These solutions are designed to address real-world challenges while harnessing the security inherent to blockchain technology.

### Ecosystem Fit

Cyborg Network augments the Polkadot ecosystem by ushering in decentralized cloud and edge computing, crucial for the burgeoning Web3 and blockchain landscapes. By primarily catering to Web2 application providers, we're paving the way for a fresh wave of users to engage with the Polkadot ecosystem, fueling its expansion.

Though Cyborg and the [Phala Network](https://phala.network/) share aspirations of decentralized cloud computing within the Polkadot/Kusama environment, our technical paths are distinct. Phala leans towards off-chain computation, anchored by a fortified smart contract platform. Our perspective suggests Phala may resonate more with traditional sectors, like health tech, aiming to harness blockchain's innovation. Conversely, our insights show that off-chain computation finds favor with Web2-centric applications. Hence, rather than viewing Phala as a direct rival, we consider them as a complementary entity, even if occasional market overlaps arise.

Our ultimate ambition is to evolve into a comprehensive decentralized edge computing network, thereby unlocking novel markets, especially in real-time data management for edgeAI and edge IoT devices.

For instance, we've been in discussions with a firm operating security cameras monitoring vehicular compliance, like adherence to seatbelt regulations and lane discipline. Their operations grapple with latency challenges attributed to the tangible distance separating cloud data centers and the cameras. Our solution addresses this by offering proximate edge instances hosted by local entities but ensuring utmost security through a protected computing environment, a feature we're actively developing.

The technological landscape sees a plethora of competitors, each carving their niche with unique technical and market strategies. Renowned names include [SONM](https://sonm.com/), [Aleph.im](https://aleph.im/), [Akash Network](https://akash.network/), [Golem](https://www.golem.network/) and [Cudos](https://www.cudos.org/) among others. The vast spectrum of contenders across diverse ecosystems underscores our mission's gravity. To maintain its edge, Polkadot must foster a spectrum of cloud computing initiatives, directly rivaling centralized Web2 behemoths like AWS and Google Cloud, thereby consolidating its position against formidable adversaries.

It's worth highlighting that the Solana ecosystem, discerning the nuances between different cloud computing models, endorses both in-chain (Akash) and off-chain (Aleph.im) decentralized projects. Such a discerning approach grants Solana a competitive edge in the decentralized cloud computing domain.
