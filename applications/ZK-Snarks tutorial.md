# ZK-Snarks tutorial
- **Team Name:** Bright Inventions
- **Payment Address:** 0xD75dDC4Aa3618e1417c68E5Df79ef9D66E4B1Ed9
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2


## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Main goal of this PoC is to introduce the substrate community into the zk-snarks concept. At this point we would like to create a few blog posts with the tutorial codebase, which will help in better understanding the zk-snarks for the substrate community.


### Project Details
Short description of the problem: Bob has sha256 hashed value and he would like to make sure Alice knows hashed value without Alice revealing it. To do so, Alice can use zksnarks to prove him she knows given value without making it public.

```
function C(X, w) -> bool {
  return ( sha256(w) == X );
}
```

### Technology stack


* Rust - groth16 proof verification
* Substrate - environment for pallet creation
* [Circom compiler](https://docs.circom.io/) - model problem to be solved by prover
* SnarkJS - zksnark setup and proof generation
* PolkadotJS - presentation purposes



### Ecosystem Fit

By preparing a tutorial with basic implementation of the ZK-Snarks ion Substrate ecosystem, we hope to popularise this concept and make it more accessible to the Substrate developers. There are similar initiatives available in other blockchain technologies, however currently there is no easily accessible up to date demonstrational implementation of ZK-Snarks. 

Few years ago a project aiming at such implementation ([Zeropool Substrate](https://github.com/zeropoolnetwork/zeropool-substrate-groth16-example)) was shared on github, however it is not up to date at the moment. We haven't found a working, updated solution available to the public.

As our implementation will be accompanied by series of blog posts and a youtube tutorial video, we aim to reach wider audience and provide an accessible introduction to ZK-Snarks in Substrate for developers.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:
### Overview
> 
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 10 weeks
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 25 000 DAI
### Milestone 1
- **Estimated duration:** 4 weeks
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 10 000 DAI

Create a pallet which will store a necessary data for a zk-Snarks + Research on ZK-Snarks concept 
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide inline documentation. The accompanying blogpost will also serve as an additional documentation. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | We will provide unit tests for the pallet and the guidelines for running and testing it. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | The pallet | Pallet allows storing a verification key and the proof on the blockchain and run the on-chain verification. With the first milestone we will provide a dummy version mechanism, which is going to be replaced with the grooth16 in the next milestone. |
| 2. | Blog post | With the first blog post we would like to focus on describing the audience the Zk-Snarks concept: A/ what are the zk-snarks, B/ describing the “Bob” problem and how they can solve it. C/ describing the process of creating proof D/ creating a “circom” example where we generate a proof. |


### Milestone 2
- **Estimated duration:** 6 weeks
- **FTE:**  1
- **Costs:** 15 000 DAI

Implement the on-chain proof verification mechanism followed by series of educational materials. 


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| **0a.** | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 / MIT / Unlicense |
| **0b.** | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a tutorial (which will be a part of the blog post) that explains how a user can (for example) spin up Substrate nodes and upload a verification key and the proof. This will show how the new functionality works. |
| **0c.** | Testing and Testing Guide | We will provide unit tests for the proof verification mechanism. |
| **0d.** | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Research notes | Mathematical calculations based on Groth16 |
| 2. | Groth16  proof verification method | Implement Groth16  proof verification method which will be used by pallet |
| 3. | Demo | Create a demo, where we will use a 3-rd party tool to verify a solution & where we Alice could be rewarded for finding a solution. |
| 4. | Circuits in circom | Prepare a circuits in circom, which will describe our problem |
| 5. | Blog post: Tutorial Groth16 (Part 1) |  describing the groth16 & running "circom proof" from previous post with the Rust Unit test / CMD |
| 6. | Blog post: Tutorial Pallet (Part 2) | updating the pallet with the groth16 & running an example from the previous tutorial with the PolkaJS |
| 7. | Youtube video |Youtube video tutorial explaining the concepts from the blog posts |
