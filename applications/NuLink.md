## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

Our project NuLink is trying to bridge the NuCypher Network to Polkadot Ecosystem. The [NuCypher Network](https://docs.nucypher.com/en/latest/index.html) is a decentralized network of nodes that perform threshold cryptography operations serving users with secrets management and dynamic access control; in particular, NuCypher currently offers a threshold proxy re-encryption solution that enables secure data sharing which can be used to construct content management platforms, secure messaging, encrypted NFTs, and many other applications.

Through our project, users and applications from Polkadot could take advantage of NuCypher Network. For example, a user Alice in Polkadot could share her private data to another user Bob using the integration from our project, without worrying information leaking to any third party, thanks to NuCypher cryptographic assurance.

The main components of the project are:

1. A mirror pallet which can retrieve the information of stakers and bonding workers from NuCypher contracts in Ethereum to Polkadot parachain;
2. A policy management pallet which holds policy fees and distributes them to nodes of the network.

### Project Description

+ In the NuCypher Network, all the cryptography operation are currently performed in an off-chain side channel. We can reuse this side channel in our project. We only need to take care of the on-chain operation from Ethereum to Polkadot. The on-chain operation mainly include two parts: Stakers need to register and get rewards on-chain, while Alice need to grant access to Bob and pay fees to stakers on-chain. NuLink would focus on migrating the on-chain operation from Ethereum to Polkadot parachain.
+ We will develop a mirror pallet which can retrieve the information of stakers and bonding workers from Nucypher contracts in Ethereum. At current stage we consider constructing a watcher network managed by NuCypher team. The watcher network would relay such information to the mirror pallet. 
+ The watcher network would be constructed by a certain amount(say N) of watcher nodes.  And their corresponding public key would be recorded in the mirror pallet when first deployed.  The update request must obtain more the 2/3 signature of the total watcher nodes to be valid. The mirror pallet would check the signature  when receiving the update request.  The locking period of Ursulas network is 7 days, so the watcher network would sending the update request in the same pace.
+  In the future we may use ETH-Polkadot bridge such as Snowbridge to retrieve such information from Ethereum instead of the watcher network. The details would be updated once we finish the design.
+ We would also develop a policy management pallet which can hold policy fees and distribute them in Polkadot parachain. Through this pallet, Alice in Polkadot could issue a policy in polkadot parachain and pay the policy fee in Polkadot parachain. And the worker of Ursulas could withdraw the reward in Polkadot parachain.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 month
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):** 2
* **Total Costs:** 10,000 DAI.


### Milestone 1 Implement Mirror Pallet
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 5,000 DAI

| Number | Deliverable                          | Specification                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can use the pallet. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | This milestone will have unit-test for each function to ensure functionality. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 1.     | SetWatchers   | This function would record the public key of the watcher nodes and would be executed when the mirror pallet first deployed. |
| 2.     | ValidateWatchers | This function would check the signature in updating request. It would return true only when more than 2/3 watcher nodes sign the updating request. |
| 3.     | UpdateStakers   | This function would provide the functionality of updating the information of current stakers and bonding workers of Ursulas network. |
| 4.     | GetActiveStakers | This function would return a list of active stakers by random sampling. |

### Milestone 2 Implement Policy Management Pallet
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 5,000 DAI

| Number | Deliverable                          | Specification                                                |

| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can use this pallet. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | This milestone will have unit-test for each function to ensure functionality. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 1.     | CreatePolicy | This function would lock the fee for a specific policy for a locking period. |
| 2.     | RevokePolicy | This function would revoke a specific policy and refund the unconsumed policy fee depending on the locking period. |
| 3.     | Mint | This function would computes and transfers the policy fee to the stakerâ€™s account |
| 4.     | Withdraw | The staker could call this function to claim the reward fee. |



## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

We have discussed this project  with NuCypher core team and get some technical support from NuCypher team. The client of watcher nodes would be implemented indepently and not funded by this proposal. We would develop the watcher network along with NuCypher team to provide such functionality.
