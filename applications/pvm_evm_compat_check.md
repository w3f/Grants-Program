# LimeChain Polkadot VM - EVM Compatibility Checker

- **Team Name:**¬†LimeChain
- **Payment Address:** 14dut6zGgdVmKijePZzrQAy2gZ6FmMDmzzp7VqjzPV9E4ujR
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):**¬†3

## **Project Overview** üìÑ

This is an application for a Research Grant. It involves deploying Solidity Contracts and Chai Test scripts in order to identify and report incompatibilities of the PVM and EVM runtimes.

### **Overview**

- **Title:**¬†PVM <> EVM Compatibility Checker
- **Summary:**¬†This project attempts to identify inconsistencies in the PVM runtime that would manifest themselves when running arbitrary EVM Solidity contracts. For the purposes of the compatibility tests, we have chosen some of the more common use cases and contracts, focusing on open-source contracts available for the Ethereum Ecosystem. Our goal is to deploy these contracts onto a testnet, and run the Chai Tests that would usually run locally on Hardhat, on-chain.
- **Relevance:**¬†We intend to deploy these contracts on the Paseo Network, and run live tests on a functioning testnet. The goal is to evaluate the functionality in a non-synthetic environment. Our team has previously built EVM compatibility verification tools, and we are interested in increasing the adoption of blockchain technology, and believe that having transferrable skills is necessary to accelerate this adoption.
- **Result:**¬†The results of the automated tests are to be collated and eventually published to¬†[Parity's issue tracker](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues)

### **Project Details**

Currently, the PVM is a fairly new piece of technology, developed for the explicit purpose of providing Solidity developers a mechanism to deploy their contracts on Polkadot. Building a Smart Contract from Solidity to a PVM blob requires the use of multiple tools:

```mermaid

graph LR
  solc -->
  YUL -->
  revive -->
  LLVM -->
  RISC-V -->
  PVM-Linker -->
  PVM-Blob
```

During the build process it has been shown that there can be inconsistencies in the management of 256-bit integers and certain opcodes may react differently. What we inted to explore is to what level of maturity has the compatibility reached, and if there are any issues discovered, to report those to the Parity team so that they can identify and improve the compatibility of their compiler.

The methodology followed involves the following:

1. Identifying the test-cases that should fall under the category of "Common" use-cases.
2. Gather the relevant contracts into a repository
3. Write/adapt tests for the contracts
4. Design a testbench that executes and gathers results from tests
5. Build CI/CD pipeline to execute the following flow
    - Compile contracts to Blobs
    - Deploy contracts to Paseo network
    - Spin up a testbench
    - Execute tests
    - Collate test results
6. Push results to¬†[Parity's issue tracker](https://github.com/paritytech/contract-issues)

Considering that the project will be open sourced, we expect contributors to be able to add their own tests in the future, or re-run tests in order to validate the repeatability of issues, and verify if issues were fixed.

### **Ecosystem Fit**

The PVM Compatibility checker should provide developers with the necessary information to appropriately develop their Smart Contracts for Polkadot, especially considering and knowing the differences between the two ecosystems and how PVM differs from EVM. For the ecosystem that would mean that developers can adopt Polkadot more readily, and confidently deploy their contracts, knowing that their use-case has been verified.

Eventually we expect that the tool does not just become informative, but also the driver for improvement in compatibility. We hope that by bringing a full list of incompatibilities for the most used contracts, and eventually enriching into the more niche contracts, we can encourage improvements into the PVM and Revive compiler.

There is a similar project that has been done for Hedera, where they used a similar approach to¬†[validate and track compatibility with EVM](https://hedera.com/blog/evm-equivalence-unveiling-hederas-strategy-for-enhanced-programmability-and-network-adoption)¬†for their network.

### **Team's experience**

At LimeChain, –∞ tech-agnostic blockchain development company, we believe in a multi-chain future, based on the priniciples of interoperability, decentralization and adoption. Our vision is to help contribute to a world where  individuals, businesses, and organisations have more agency to connect, cooperate, and create value through blockchain products and solutions. We‚Äôve been a major contributor to tge to the Polkadot ecosystem for 5+ years, namely through a suite of projects like

[Gosemble, a framework for building Substrate compatible Runtimes in Go](https://github.com/LimeChain/gosemble), [a framework for runtimes in AssemblyScript](https://github.com/LimeChain/subsembly), [Fruzhin a Polkadot Java Host Implementation](https://github.com/limechain/fruzhin), [Parachain Validation Conformance Testing](https://polkadot.polkassembly.io/motion/389), [Giant Squid Main](https://github.com/LimeChain/giant-squid-main) - providing the community with access to on-chain data in the form of GraphQL gateways and [Polkadot DevGround](https://devground.xyz/).  Our team has also worked extensively on the EVM compatibility of Hedera, and the accumulated knowledge, approach and expertise is directly transferrable and  relevant for this research.

## **Development Status** üìñ

The idea behind this grant came up during discussions with W3F, with the idea being to carry out research into the Ethereum incompatibility of the PVM and the¬†revive compiler, and deploying different well-known solidity smart contracts on the testnet to create a list of issues.¬†

## **Future Plans**

This project is expected to be open sourced. As a result we hope that the community will use it afterward to enrich the compatibility testing of the PVM.

All packages are self-contained and executable, which means that anyone can fork it, make their own modifications and run it without any external assistance. LimeChain intends to continue work with the W3F after the completion of this project to better understand what the Long-term needs would be for a tool like this, and collaborating with the W3F to enrich it with new features.

## **Additional Information** ‚ûï

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** We learnt about the grants program from several places, including the Web3 Foundation website, and have since then applied for several grants. We have been a major contributor to the Polkadot ecosystem for the last 5+ years and are always looking for ways to help improve the ecosystem and drive greater adoption.
