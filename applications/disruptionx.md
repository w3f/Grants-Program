### Overview

Please provide the following:

DisruptionX is a Web3 Game Publishing Platform focused on driving Revenue and Data to Game Developers and Gamers. 

For Game Developers, a comprehensive SDK facilitates Web3 integration, whilst enhancing the game with unique ecosystem and data capabilities such as Prize Pool Game Modes, Esports Tournament Systems and a flow of data insights powered by Machine Learning.

For Gamers, DisruptionX provides a destination for Web3 gaming including high quality Web3 enhanced games with new Risk-to-Earn and Play-to-Own economic models and Esports functionalities all underpinned by ML to ensure balanced, secure and fair gaming.

To showcase the capabilities of the SDK and ecosystem, DX is building Line of Control, a Unreal Engine 5 built First Person Shooter to demonstrate Web3 capabilities and refine the platform for both game developers and gamers. 

The game itself is custom built to test each component of the SDK.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

MVP built at dev.disruptionx.io

To achieve widespread adoption of Web3 gaming, a dual improvement is required in the quality of game titles and tokenomics including advancements in NFT utilities. Blockchain gaming must provide an engaging and immersive experience, including:
High standard of gameplay and choice across platforms such as PC and mobile devices. 
A low threshold for existing Web2 Game Developers to integrate their games into Web3
Community incentivized gaming through the utilization of guilds and Web3 esports
Sustainable economies that distribute rewards democratically
Increased monetary kickback to developers by taking advantage of new Web3 and GameFi opportunities
Replacing play-to-earn with more sustainable economic incentives for gamers, such as risk-to-earn and play-to-own

DisruptionX has a working MVP for its consumer facing platform, a working prototype of its UE5 FPS game (Line of Control) and team is currently developing the SDK for third party game developers. 


### Ecosystem Fit

We believe that your support to DisruptionX will help the XXXXXX ecosystem in four key areas:

User Growth: DisruptionX will be a destination for Web3 gaming and a key onboarding station for Web2 gamers to start their Web3 journey. Not only will users start their journey with interactions of the XXXXXX ecosystem but they will also become more familiar to use it across the wider crypto space driving long-term user retention to the XXXXXXX ecosystem.

Transaction & Fee Volume: Users will use the DisruptionX platform to transact In-game purchases, Battle passes, NFTs and Tournament entries resulting in a significant volume of transactions and fees generated over a prolonged period for the XXXXXXX ecosystem. DisruptionX has built out user projections growing beyond 1M users in 18-24 months due to the transition of Web2 gamers to Web3 gaming.

Market Traction: DisruptionX will leverage 100+ partnerships to launch into the market in 2023. Through XXXXXX integration with DX, the ecosystem will benefit from the huge market exposure and ongoing marketing efforts. Partnerships include:
Sakura Guild Games, a large gaming guild based in Japan with over 10k members
XBorg, a next-gen esports platform with 8k members
Kairos Media, a leading web3 gaming media agency with relationships with the world's biggest influencers and streamers.
PathDAO, a gaming DAO with over 50k members
Many more as shown on our pitch deck

More Developers: With GameFi being a major focus on new projects, supporting XXXXXX chain within the DisruptionX ecosystem will ensure XXXXXX is a key protocol in the Web3 gaming sector to develop on in the future leading to continued developer familiarity and growth.

User Acquision will be done via multiple channels. At DisruptionX, we believe that the fastest way for Web3 adoption is via gaming due to tech literacy and exposure. Gamers are the biggest audience for us and we leverage on producing content to bring gamers onto our platform. If we look at gaming as a form of content, we become hyper versatile as we live in the age of constant content consumption. 

Our strategy is built around: 
Content consumption: Encouraging UGC short and ultrashort content creation with a content creator programme -Esports content. Building and listing esports ready games that will lead to competitive gaming content generation that will reach out to the masses of Web2 gamers 

Content gratification: Rewarding gamers that display loyalty as a strategy for retention on our platform -providing a variety of multiple genre of games to satiate the gamers' hunger for quality Web3 games that allows true ownership of their game digital assets 

Partnership Activation: Working with media partners we have secured with access to 50M+ combined audience including DappRadar, Kairos Media (Influencer Marketing), Hikaru (Japan) and several gaming DAO's to drive visibility to the project -close partnership with several guilds including Sakura, Valluna, CritTheory and Hooga Gaming to engagde their members with opportunities within LOC -affiliate model with large gaming communities and the DX Ambassador programme 

O2O presence: Creating touch points for gamers not only online, but also to have multiple offline events to increase reach and improve conversion. Quality esports tournaments will draw eyeballs and interest because DX will be the hub for quality spectatorship games
