## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Our project focuses on the development of mobile compatibility for the [Polkadot apps wallet](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer), an official interface to the Polkadot ecosystem that is currently unoptimized for mobile use (see Figure 1). With the understanding that mobile traffic makes up a significant percentage of all web traffic, we see a need for a version of the wallet that can be easily accessed and navigated on mobile phones. This modification will enable us to tap into the potential new users who have been deterred by the wallet's current limitations.

This project is an integral part of the Polkadot ecosystem. By creating a mobile-optimized version of the Polkadot apps wallet, we will increase the overall accessibility and usability of the ecosystem. Our mobile-friendly interface will provide a seamless user experience, opening up the entire ecosystem to a broader user base and facilitating greater integration and interaction with the Substrate framework and Kusama network.

Our team is deeply invested in the development of a parachain designed specifically for use on mobile devices. With the increasing prevalence of mobile web use, we recognize the urgent need for a mobile web version of the Polkadot apps wallet. This development is crucial for our parachain's success as it will provide users with seamless, efficient, and user-friendly access to our offerings. Through this project, we aim to align the Polkadot ecosystem's accessibility with current mobile usage trends, ensuring the wide adoption and practical usability of our mobile-centric parachain. Our team's passion and expertise in mobile blockchain applications make us committed to seeing this project come to fruition, ushering in a new era of convenience and accessibility for Polkadot, Substrate, and Kusama users.

### Project Details

We intend to optimize all pages found at https://polkadot.js.org/apps for better mobile compatibility. In order to enhance navigation on smartphones, we will implement a hamburger-style site menu. The display of this menu is illustrated in Figure 2.

The submenu specifically for tools will be retained in its original form, also as demonstrated in Figure 2. When users tap on the hamburger menu, they will be presented with a comprehensive menu displayed vertically, as depicted in Figure 3.

Furthermore, the network selector will be repositioned to the left side of the smartphone screen for easier accessibility, as shown in Figure 4. This adjustment enhances the mobile user experience, making the navigation through the Polkadot ecosystem more seamless and intuitive.

### Ecosystem Fit

Our project primarily fits into the Polkadot ecosystem, where it serves to enhance the user experience by optimizing the Polkadot apps wallet for mobile use. This interface improvement will enhance the accessibility of the entire Polkadot ecosystem, as well as applications built on Substrate and projects within the Kusama network.

Our target audience consists of mobile users of the Polkadot ecosystem, wallet/UI developers, designers, and the user base of our own mobile-optimized parachain. Additionally, we aim to reach potential users who may be deterred by the current lack of mobile compatibility in the Polkadot apps wallet.

Our project addresses the need for improved mobile access to the Polkadot apps wallet. With mobile internet usage increasing, there is a critical demand for seamless, user-friendly mobile interfaces within the blockchain ecosystem. By providing mobile compatibility for the Polkadot apps wallet, we will lower barriers for entry, increase user accessibility, and improve the overall user experience.

To our knowledge, there are no other projects currently aimed at optimizing the Polkadot apps wallet for mobile use within the Substrate, Polkadot, or Kusama ecosystem.

While there are several Polkadot wallet apps available for Android and iOS, these require users to install them first before use. This is a step that can potentially create friction for some users. Additionally, these mobile applications do not address the needs of users who wish to access the wallet through a web browser on their smartphones.

Therefore, our project remains unique in its efforts to provide a mobile-optimized web version of the Polkadot apps wallet, improving its usability and accessibility without the need for any additional downloads or installations. This is crucial in ensuring a seamless experience for users who prefer or require web-based access, catering to their specific needs within the broader Polkadot, Substrate, and Kusama ecosystem.

## Future Plans

In the short term, we plan to concentrate on the development and testing of the mobile optimization for the Polkadot apps wallet. Our primary goal is to ensure that the interface is user-friendly, intuitive, and fully functional.

Once the development phase is complete, we will move on to a comprehensive testing phase. We will seek feedback from a diverse set of users to ensure that our mobile interface meets their needs effectively and efficiently.

Promotion of our project is also a key short-term plan. We aim to leverage various channels including blockchain forums, social media platforms, and potentially hosting webinars and online workshops. We will focus on highlighting the benefits of our mobile-optimized Polkadot apps wallet, with the aim of expanding its user base.

Our long-term plans focus on continuous improvement and expansion of our project. Based on user feedback and evolving market trends, we will strive to implement enhancements to the wallet's mobile interface.

Ultimately, our team is committed to contributing to the Polkadot ecosystem's growth. We will continually monitor and adapt to changes in the industry, ensuring that our mobile-optimized Polkadot apps wallet remains a vital and relevant tool for users.

It's necessary for us to maintain the mobile version as our own parachain project is designed for use on smartphones.
