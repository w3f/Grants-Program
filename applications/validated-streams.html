To ensure the reliability and integrity of the data submitted on-chain, we require that at least two-thirds of the validators witness the event and confirm that it have indeed occurred off-chain.</p><p>By implementing Validated Streams on top of Substrate, we hope it could integrate with Substrate-based smart contracts, allowing developers to build more powerful and sophisticated applications that take advantage of features from both Validated Streams and Smart Contracts.</p><p>Validated Streams is a part of a grander vision of proactive blockchain applications that interact richly with the off-chain world while still remaining trustless and decentralized, that our team has been pushing for some years, and is now building piece-by-piece as we keep seeking the best ways to realize it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/5276727/211316562-ad73fdd0-0dec-4543-884e-fe60cb09ee7a.png" alt="Diagram of Validated Streams, with Stream service ingesting events from an application, passing them to a gossip, which then leads to on-chain transactions, that, after block finalization, get forwarded back to the application. (validated-streams.drawio.png)" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>A Validated Streams oracle proves the occurrence of off-chain events, after they have been witnessed by at least 2/3-s of its validators.</p><p>Each of validator is a Substrate node that has an attached trusted client. The client submits hashes representing events that have been witnessed locally. Since a malicious client could fabricate data or censor it instead of reporting to the validator, it is necessary that the operators of validators don&#x27;t trust other validators (or thirdparties in general) with the task of witnessing events, but run their own trusted clients, perhaps even collocating them with the validator node.</p><p>To avoid swamping or stalling the chain with blocks containing as-of-yet-invalid events (especially in cases where trusted clients have just started witnessing an event), after receiving an event hash, the validator first gossips that hash, signed, to other validators (using Substrate&#x27;s <code>sc_network_gossip</code> API). The event hash is submitted as an extrinsic only once it has been witnessed by 2/3 of the validators (weighted by stake).</p><p>Afterwards, the event is finalized through any of the usual on-chain mechanisms (such as GRANDPA), and once final, is considered proven by the Validated Streams oracle.</p><p>As it is possible for momentary disruptions or malfeasance of validators or off-chain services sourcing the data for events to cause the state recorded on-chain and the state existing off-chain to differ, we send the finalized event hashes back to the trusted clients, which can then, depending on the exact use case, use this information to, e.g. adapt its own state to on-chain proceedings, witness some form of correction to the finalized events, or report the discrepancy to its users/operators.</p><p>As noted on the diagram, we are planning to use <a href="https://github.com/comrade-coop/validated-streams/blob/main/proto/streams.proto" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a gRPC protocol</a> for the communication of hashes between the trusted client and the validator node, instead of the more usual JSON-RPC used throughout Substrate, since such an API would allow the final product to be immediately usable with a wider variety of commonly-used programming languages and software development frameworks, and we aim to make the final product as accessible as we can.</p><p>Do note that because the trusted client only ever submits hashes, a separate product (say, IFPS) would be required for it to retrieve the actual event contents.</p><p>We have implemented a <a href="https://github.com/comrade-coop/validated-streams" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proof-of-concept implementation</a> of Validated Streams as we&#x27;ve explored the Substrate API.</p><p>While the Validated Streams concept is generic enough to apply to some existing oracles and maybe even blockchains, we want to encapsulate it in a way that other developers could then use to implement their own blockchain solutions on top. As such, within the scope of this project we will not be creating a new blockchain/consensus network, but only a software package implementing the Validated Streams protocol on top of Substrate, plus the related documentation, tutorials, suggested deployment configurations, and the like. Developers would then be free to take that package and run their own chains validating the events they configure them to.</p><p>In addition, we find it important to note that Validated Streams as currently envisioned would only work in chains where the total number/weight of validators is known, such as proof-of-stake or private/consortium chains; further research might be able to lift that limitation in the future, but this is again outside the scope of this grant proposal.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>Creating reliable oracles can be challenging, as making a protocol, ensuring the accuracy of the data being used, and finding the validators to run one are all hard problems. While the Validated Streams abstraction doesn&#x27;t automatically solve all of those problems, it allows developers to re-focus on providing validators with accurate data without needing to worry about creating a whole new protocol.</p><p>Once finished, Validated Streams could be used to create decentralized oracles that provide off-chain data to other parts of the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, such as blockchains or applications that connect to the network via Polkadot&#x27;s interchain communication protocols, or just Substrate-based smart contracts in general. In that case, parachain and dApp developers would benefit from having another way to provide real-time data to smart contracts or to build decentralized applications that interact with the real world.</p><p>In addition, we see a use for Validated Streams in the creation of hybrid off-chain/on-chain applications, where developers use it to write traditional applications that are linked to a blockchain using a &quot;validated&quot; output &quot;stream&quot; of events. This can enable traditional application developers (such as ourselves, outside the Cooperative) to build applications that are more secure and trustworthy, as they can rely on the validation provided by the Validated Streams service.</p><p>And, finally, we see some potential use cases around sourcing data for decentralized AI models (where Validated Streams would allow for a single consensus dataset to be built and added to in real-time, without necessarily giving any centralized party a final vote on what&#x27;s included), and the creation of decentralized news platforms (where parties contribute news stories or verify the accuracy of existing stories), but it is possible that both of those would require additional thought, research, and development before they can be realized.</p><p>There are existing projects similar to Validated Streams, many of which we&#x27;ve taken inspiration from.</p><p>A major one would be Chainlink. While both work on providing ways to create and use oracles, Chainlink is a standalone decentralized oracle network that integrates with a variety of blockchain platforms, while Validated Streams is a Substrate-based blockchain-building framework that can used by decentralized applications directly. Also, Chainlink uses a reputation-based system to ensure the reliability of the data being provided by its oracles, while Validated Streams uses a consensus mechanism based on concrete events being witnessed to ensure the accuracy of the data being used by oracles.</p><p>While a Chainlink Feed pallet already exists within the Polkadot / Kusama network, we hope that by offering something more directly based on top of Substrate, we might provide a viable alternative for developers who don&#x27;t necessarily want to use Chainlink itself.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Team leader: Bozhidar Marinov</li><li>Team: Salih Houadef</li><li>Advisors: Todor Kolev, Branimir Angelov</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Bozhidar Marinov</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:b.marinov@comrade.coop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">b.marinov@comrade.coop</a></li><li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://comrade.coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://comrade.coop/</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> 47, &quot;Cherni vrah&quot; blvd, Sofia 1407, Bulgaria</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> Comrade Cooperative</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>Bozhidar has roughly 13 years of programming experience (started programming at 7) on a wide variety of projects, from web interfaces to games to backend systems to smart contracts.

There, the Validated Streams project would allow agents on a future Apocryph platform to react to real-world events as those occur.</p><p>In fact, we are currently exploring the possibility of building (and refining) our vision for Apocryph in a piecemeal fashion where we build each of the components that might be useful in other projects independently, before eventually combining them.</p><p>In the shorter term, we will strive to maintain the repository, bugfixing and perhaps even new features, after the grant is complete, especially if there is interest in the project from outside parties.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="additional-information-">Additional Information ➕<a href="#additional-information-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Additional Information ➕" title="Direct link to Additional Information ➕">​</a></h2><p><strong>How did you hear about the Grants Program?</strong> We found the grants program via GitHub Trending, while simultaneously discovering that Substrate would be a great fit for our project on accident. As that seemed like too good of a coincidence to pass up, we decided to apply.</p><p>While our coop organization has received a previous grant from Aragon Nest for an unrelated project, this is the first grant we are applying to in regards to the Validated Streams project.</p><p>We have worked on the code and vision for Apocryph for a few years now, ever since we noticed that many of our Cooperative&#x27;s projects were facing very similar issues around moving data and organizing code--and deciding we could do better. While not all of our attempts in bringing it about have been successful, we have been slowly coming to better solutions, and hope that it will all click one day.</p></div><footer
