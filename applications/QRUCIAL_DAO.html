This is the reason we want to build a system in which the community and the projects can trust that a security assessment has in fact been done professionally.
Too often, security audits of web3 projects are performed in a way that relies on intransparency and blind trust in a company logo instead of a proof of computation as well as a proof that the auditor is knowledgeable of the task at hand. It seems that many auditing companies are not in security, but the PDF business. We want to change this.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project&#x27;s expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):</p><ul><li><p>QDAO is a multichain solution which brings security services and tools to the blockchain. Such services include automated smart contract audits and tools like symbolic analyzers.
We are the first connecting defensive as well as offensive security tool execution to the blockchain. A Web3 Security Toolkit is to be built, and the tools inside will be executable on QDAO nodes. In the beginning, we will be focusing on auditing tools. The tooling itself is bundled in a container and is being developed and maintained and voted on by QRUCIAL and the DAO though the nominated proof of stake governance system. The distribution of the containers is done through decentralized means. Runtime upgrades are used to update the toolbox on each node.</p></li><li><p>Research and meeting notes to be added and their results</p></li><li><p>An overview of the technology stack to be used</p></li><li><p>Core components include Substrate, QRUCIAL DAO runtime, pallets and the ExoGlue.</p></li><li><p>PoC can be found in the reference QRUCIAL DAO repository below.</p></li><li><p>What your project is <em>not</em> or will <em>not</em> provide or implement</p><ul><li>We won&#x27;t solve business questions here, though we think our idea fill fit into the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem.</li><li>This project won&#x27;t save all the smart contracts or render manual auditors/hackers useless.

It is implemented as a combination of a pallet and a daemon, running on the same system as the blockchain node.
ExoSys is also responsible for issuing the Non-Transferrable NFTs and keeps a track record of audit hashes and meta data.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-exotool">What is ExoTool?<a href="#what-is-exotool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is ExoTool?" title="Direct link to What is ExoTool?">​</a></h4><p>Selected set of security auditor tools, packaged and adapted to be executed by the request of ExoSys.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-auditorrep">What is AuditorRep?<a href="#what-is-auditorrep" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is AuditorRep?" title="Direct link to What is AuditorRep?">​</a></h4><p>Élő&#x27;s assumption is that the performance of an auditor in each audit is a random variable following a normal distributed bell curve over time.
An auditor might perform significantly better or worse from one audit to the next.
Using Élő their mean skill level would remain the same.
The assumption here is that the mean skill level of an auditor changes slowly over time.
Each audit can be challenged by other auditors with a high enough score, who can either find other vulnerabilities or remove  false positives the original auditor has missed.
If additional vulnerabilities are found or  false positives are removed, the challenging auditor increase their own score and decrease the score of the original auditor.
The increase and decrease of every individual auditor is relative to the Élő score of the original auditor and the one re-auditing a project.</p><p>High ranked auditor wins:</p><ul><li>few points are transferred from the low ranked auditor to the higher rated one.</li></ul><p>Low rated auditor wins:</p><ul><li>a lot of points are transferred from the higher rated auditor to the low rated one.</li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="what-is-the-cctf-talent-pool">What is the CCTF talent pool?<a href="#what-is-the-cctf-talent-pool" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to What is the CCTF talent pool?" title="Direct link to What is the CCTF talent pool?">​</a></h4><p>CCTF provides a proven track record of hackers solving challenges and based on their reputation, they are awarded as manual auditors in the QDAO ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><ul><li>In the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape, this will be the first security toolkit that can be triggered by extrinsics.
