## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

  

Mempool Explorer enables Polkadot ecosystem members to monitor pending transactions across several parameters and gain meaningful insights.

  

  

**Follow-up of Mempool Dashboard - Version 1**

  

- Link to the phase 1 project: [medium](https://medium.com/protofire-blog/monitoring-pending-transactions-in-polkadot-with-mempool-explorer-36e88e8a41ed)

  

  

However the project was created by a different team, Protofire. Currently it's not in working condition, the provided link https://mempool.dot.protofire.io/ doesn't work anymore.

  

  

### Overview

  

Version 2 of mempool dashboard, is a tool to monitor pending transactions in Polkadot, Kusama, Westend, Rococo and you can add your customized network.

  

  

**Current issues with the initial implementation**

  

version 1 of the mempool dashboard is not in working condition. I took this opportunity to revive the project and create a next version of the original project by fixing the current issues, creating a new UI to enhance user experience and readability and improvements to the API.

  

  

My first task was to understand the codebase, identify the current issue and provide a fix for it. After applying a few patches I was able to restore back to the original state, however still with few issues.

  

  

**Noteable issues**

  

- [proper balance amount was not displayed correctly](https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer/issues/4)

  

- [docker scripts not working](https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer/issues/1)

  

- [enhance caching logic](https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer/issues/5)

  

- [feature to view accounts/txn details not working properly across different networks](https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer/issues/6)

  

- lack of proper code documentation ( it was difficult for me to understand the codebase initially )

  

  

and set of exhaustive open issues https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer/issues

  

track of patches/fixes done till date - https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer/commits/dev

  

We have fixed majority of the issues already.

  

  

**What's in version 2**

  

  

- new UI for desktop and mobile view [figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/2EIEKQXfpI6wBldxQ18h6Q/Polkadot-work?node-id=0:1&t=aWz2emO8pIhjWyP5-1)

  

- fix the existing issues

  

- enable CI/CD deployment to the hosted servers and fix docker scripts

  

- series of tutorials on polkadot-js APIs

  

Currently there's a lack of proper tutorials/education materials for anything polkadot-js API related stuff other than the official docs. I would like to create an extensive tutorial on how to consume polkadot-js APIs (more details in Milestone section).
  

  

why create a separate set of tutorials?

  

- currently the [polkadot JS docs](https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api) is difficult for beginners with zero or less technical knowledge about the polkadot architecture to understand properly.

  

- easy to learn and develop using polkadot JS APIs/SDKs as compared to substrate in Rust

  

  

### Project Details

  

Github: https://github.com/muddlebee/polkadot-mempool-explorer

  

API : /api folder

  

Frontend: /web folder

  

  

API uses nodejs on top of polkadot js API

  

Frontend uses React to render the transaction blocks in the UI

  

  

**Note** We already have done 50% of the proposed work, and its live in the url below

  

[mempool-ui](http://139.84.168.166:3000/#/main)

  

  

### Technology stack

  

  

- javascript, nodejs, react

  

- polkadot js API

  

- docker

  

  

### Ecosystem Fit

  

Solution that would allow members of the Polkadot ecosystem to monitor information related to pending transactions.

  

More details has been published in the phase 1 delivery report [medium](https://medium.com/protofire-blog/monitoring-pending-transactions-in-polkadot-with-mempool-explorer-36e88e8a41ed)

  

  

Tutorials for polkadot JS APIs will help educate folks who are not expert in Rust/Substrate and want to adopt JS first approach first. We have many examples of live webapps integrating polkadot JS APIs like wallets, tools etc.
