Societal allows all types of groups or communities to build their own online, transparent, and decentralized organization. Societal bundles all of the tools required to create and manage a DAO in one place. Creators will be empowered to construct a DAO with fungible, non-fungible, or a combination of governance tokens. Societal also offers DAO management tooling features like treasury management, specialized governance, task boards, legal structuring, and accounting. This removes the need to use siloed platforms to manage the operations of a DAO. Whether a creator is looking to build a DAO for their organization, raise and deploy investment capital, or decentralize governance of an NFT project, Societal has the necessary tooling for a seamless end-to-end experience. </p><p>Utilizing Polkdaot’s layer-0 infrastructure and ecosystem, Societal will provide DAOs with both maximum functionality and a cohesive user experience. With features including cross-chain governance and subscription pricing, Societal combines best-in-class features into one vertically integrated product. With integrations into DeFi, privacy, and identity protocols, Societal will enable web3 organizations to seamlessly transition and manage their DAOs into the future.</p><p>The Societal team has been building in the Polkadot ecosystem for the past two years. While at a previous Polkadot project, the Societal team noticed a lack of integrated DAO tooling - not only in the Polkadot ecosystem, but in the broader web3 industry as a whole. After analyzing how we might transition and manage our previous project into a DAO, there was no clear path. This, along with the team being both members and council members of various DAOs and noticing the lack of infrastructure, we decided to build a solution - Societal.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>Societal Labs has been designing the product vision of the Socital platform for quite some time. We will go over the project details and blockchain architecture in this application and provide references below for more in-depth context.</p><p>In Societal&#x27;s final state, it will offer four main services; Create, Transition, Transfer and Manage. Create will allow any web3 user to create their own DAO. Transition will allow protocols to progressively move towards community ownership. Transfer will allow DAOs to transfer their DAO from an expensive siloed chain to the Sociteal platform. Manage will provide DAOs all the required product features to manage their organization, whether it is a small investment club or a large community-governed protocol.</p><p>Societal will offer a wide range of features to create and manage a DAO. The features are split into three categories; Operations, Treasury, and Governance. The Operations features are: job &amp; task boards, payroll, customizable feeds, legal tooling, on-chain reputation, and a web &amp; mobile application. The Treasury features are as follows: treasury wallets (multi-sig), DeFi integrations, on-chain cap table, and accounting. The governance features are: subscription based governance, proposal calendar, built-in governance systems, and private voting.</p><p>Societal will vertically integrate with projects to advance its tech stack and product offering, something not seen in most web3 projects today. For example, Societal can integrate DeFi services by working with projects like Acala and Moonbeam, which will allow for active treasury management for DAOs managed with Societal. For private assets and voting, projects like Manta and Phala can provide privacy-enabling functions like zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environments to make this possible. For on-chain credentials, projects like KILT and Litentry can provide KYC and member credentialing services that can be used by DAOs for governance and recruiting.</p><p>Finally, Societal plans to progressively transition into a DAO itself. Once the token is launched, a community-run treasury will grow over time until the entire network is owned and operated by the community.</p><p>For more information, please refer to the following resources:</p><ul><li>Societal Whitepaper <a href="https://docsend.com/view/2gte2fd8wc4jp4rg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li><li>Societal Docs <a href="https://docs.sctl.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li><li>Societal Protoype Demo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fy-0FrfUIYw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>As it stands today, the DAO landscape within the Polkadot ecosystem is not as mature as other ecosystems such as Ethereum. This is due to insufficient DAO creation and tooling infrastructure in the ecosystem. Currently, the Polkadot ecosystem does not have the creation, governance, and treasury management tooling products that other major blockchains do. By building these tooling products on Polkadot, both the Polkadot DAO landscape and the broader DAO management tooling space are primed for innovation by utilizing the unique technical abilities that Substrate provides.</p><p>The target audience of the Societal application are web3 users who require a platform to easily create and manage their DAOs. Our project will meet the needs of the Polkadot community to create and managane their own DAOs and will be a governace scaling solution for ETH based DAOs.</p><p>The projects like Societal in the Polkadot space are Polkassembly, SubDAO, and InvArch. Societal differs from these projects in multiple ways. First, Polkassembly is not building their own parachain and is only a governance platform for large Polkadot projects. Societal wants to allow any web3 user to create their own DAO - not just catering to large established protocols. SubDAO has recently been focusing on smart contract deployments on multiple chains and does not appear to be building a parachain. Societal will build its own parachain and use the technical capabilities of Substrate to be truly token agnostic, connecting with widely used wallets such as MetaMask, to avoid doing multiple chain deployments via smart contracts. InvArch Factory is similar to Societal in the sense that they are building their own parachian, however we plan to offer a SaaS based pricing model so we can change the DAOs a monthly subscription fee and eliminate the fees for the organizations members. Societal will also seek to integrate with other chains, having cross-chain governace execution. </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Graeme Fox</li><li>Tyler Gellatly</li><li>Oleh Kalenyk</li><li>Alibek Sansyzbayev</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Graeme Fox</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:graeme@sctl.xyz" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">graeme@sctl.xyz</a></li><li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.sctl.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.sctl.xyz/</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> Brookfield Place, Suite 2700, 225 6 Ave SW, Calgary, AB T2P 1N2</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> Societal Labs Ltd.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>Graeme Fox is the Co-Founder &amp; CEO of Societal, a specialized blockchain designed for the creation and management of DAOs.

We believe that this subscription pricing system will be a great on-ramp of DAOs from other ecosystems into Polkadot, as the organization members do not have to purchase the Societal token to participate in on-chain transactions. This will reduce the barrier for these DAOs to use a governance scaling solution for their organization, such as Societal. This subscription payment system can also be used by many substrate chains to reduce this barrier adoption as well.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7"
