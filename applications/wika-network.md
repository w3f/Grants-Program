## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

#### Make the Internet a Better Place.

Our mission is to build a clean, public and non-intrusive blockchain registry to empower 
autors, search engines and recommendation systems that respect privacy and are 100% transparent.

- **Generous Internet Users** will be able to like their favorite pages and reward the authors and previous likers.

- **Internet Content Authors** will register their ownership in one public decentralized database, and whether their content lives in youtube, 
facebook, medium or any other internet place, Wika users will be able to reward them directly.
 
#### Why?

Because there are too many Like buttons out there!

Each one generates data in private databases that are often used to optimize for advertisment or hidden agendas.

Wika's idea is pretty simple: why not a clean and transparent version of those?
It could be used on any platform, with a genuine mission to improve the internet and recommend quality content.
  
Having worked as Data Scientists and Engineers in the AI space, 
we recognize the power of ML and its risks, and we believe regulations will always be one step behind 
the evolution of software systems and artificial intelligence applications. 
From our experience, the only real user data protection comes from the ethics -and also the expertise- of the teams designing the systems. 

So internet users are actually putting a great deal of trust 
into the teams building their social networks and handling their data.

Sometimes, those teams fail, by accident, incompetence, or bad intention; 
a couple of stories will pop-up in tech news; the responsible company will be fined;
and some users might even get a coupon or free services if they manage to go through a tricky claim process.

Usually, lawyers are the most fortunate actors in those stories, 
because they are the happy few taking the biggest cut of all the money flowing from the investigation and trial phases
all the way to the settlement and money distribution time.

Ironically enough: most of the users, the actual victims, 
will probably not even notice nor understand what happened to their data.

But the damages are real at the person level: stolen personal information will feed fraud and identity theft, 
and this will seriously hurt the victims.

And when data is used unethically, that means discrimination, public opinion abuse, stock market manipulation, 
social network addictions, just to name a few we already know about; plus all the negative long term effects still to be learnt. 

Long story short: data protection and algorithmic ethics are great responsibilities 
centralized into a few powerful entities.
 
So why Wika Network? Because we are engaged in solving this problem to make the internet a better place, 
and we believe that with blockchain technology and Polkadot ecosystem, 
we have all the necessary foundations and ingredients to succeed: 

- Trustless design.
- Decentralization.
- Transparency.
- Anonimity.
- Security.

    - [Browser Extension](https://github.com/randombishop/wika_browser_ext) can be installed from source.
    
* What Wika Network _is_ vs is _not_:
    - **IS:** Wika Network core product is the blockchain until we reach 
    a fully decentralized governance and maintenance process.
    
    - **IS:** Wika Network also comes with a web app and a browser extension. 
    Ultimately, we hope that alternatives will emerge with different approaches, 
    but until then, we will commit to building the front-end tools to facilitate 
    understanding, onboarding and interacting with the blockchain with the best UX. 
  
    - **IS NOT:** We will also be developing an offchain indexed database, 
    a blockchain data explorer, a recommender system prototype, 
    plugins for website developers, and other tools as our idea evolves. 
    But we think of those as simple PoC implementations to kick-start 
    all the components of the future ecosystem and test their interactions.
    Again, the architectural vision is do one thing right and plug to an ecosystem.
    

### Ecosystem Fit

* The blockchain side is developed using Substrate, 
with the intention to become a Kusama/Polkadot Parachain in the future.

* The front-end relies on the polkadot-js extension to manage signatures.

* The spirit of the design and architecture is minimalism: 
implement one simple registry and social contract, and plug to other ecosystem components to grow the capabilities.

* Target audience: internet users familiar with Polkadot wallet and blockchains, 
with the desire to make a positive contribution and protect their data.
(This will be the core community, 
then it should spread from this niche to a broader audience by educating and convincing more users.)

* Main needs met by Wika blockchain: 
    - Webpage to Owner registry
    - Universal Like Button

* Other projects similar to Wika in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem: not yet.
LikeCoin seems to be a similar initiative built with Cosmos SDK, 
but we believe our design is simpler.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
* academic publications relevant to the problem,
* links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
* references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
* previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
* **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of payment in USD for the whole project. The total amount of funding _needs to be below $30k for initial grants_ and $100k for follow-up grants. (e.g. 12,000 USD). This and the costs for each milestone need to be in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
