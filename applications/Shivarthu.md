### Overview

Shivarthu: The blockchain-based decentralized governance system   
Democracy is about fair and equal treatment of everyone in a country. But it
becomes unrealistic to achieve when political parties have their conflict of interest,
and leaders don’t have the expertise to make evidence-based policies and neither
have the skill and manpower for solving problems that surround our society and
ecosystem. The new fair democracy provides an elegant way of governance that
separates the representative responsibility according to their specialization and can
grow into any complexity. The governance is divided into various departments,
and each department is supervised by representatives with expertise in the field.
Voters are rational and need to have enough knowledge about the departments
and the department problems, in order to vote for the selecting representatives of a
department. The selection process of representatives is “difficult in and easy out”,
which allows only utilitarian actors to hold the responsibility, weeding out frivolous
ones.

Shivarthu will be build on Substrate.

Our democracy has many challenges, blockchain can provide a way to tackle those challenges by minimizing trust through game theory.  That made our team interested in creating this project.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article**/workshop that explains [...] (what was done/achieved as part of the grant). (Content, language and medium should reflect your target audience described above.)
| 1. | Substrate module: voting | This substrate module will do commit and reveal voting and seq phragmen approval voting |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  


### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
