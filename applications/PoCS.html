<p><em>Forging Secure Public Networks through Staking Smart Contracts</em></p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="brief-description">Brief Description<a href="#brief-description" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Brief Description" title="Direct link to Brief Description">​</a></h4>
<p>Blockchain technology, with the introduction of Ethereum protocol, impacted the ecosystem by introducing the concept of smart contracts. These self-executing contracts have enhanced the functionality and versatility of blockchain networks, opening up a wide array of decentralized applications and use cases. However, despite this pivotal development, there is absence of a consensus mechanism that places smart contracts at its core. Recognizing this critical gap, we present Proof of Contract Stake (PoCS) – The First Developer Centric Consensus.</p>
<p>PoCS is an innovative staking system that leverages <em>contract gas history</em> to select block producers. PoCS integrates elements of both proof-of-work and proof-of-stake. We have introduced a novel concept of <strong>&#x27;code-mining&#x27;</strong> that incentivizes developers to actively participate in securing the network. By aligning the interests of developers with the network&#x27;s security, PoCS introduces a dynamic where smart contract creators play a vital role in consensus. In addition, PoCS implements a system of <em>&#x27;stake scoring&#x27;</em>, taking into account factors such as contract age, reputation, and gas utilization. This design not only fortifies the network against collusion type attacks but also ensures a fair and secure environment for all participants. It also addresses a longstanding concern in blockchain consensus models – the &#x27;nothing at stake&#x27; attacks . By introducing a non-fungible, non-transferable unit of scarcity for staking, PoCS effectively mitigates this vulnerability, making it a secure and reliable network. In addition, the stake accumulation attack in PoCS is time constraint and patterned which can be easily detected. This escalates costs over time and cannot be expedited with any external resources.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="substrate-integration">Substrate Integration<a href="#substrate-integration" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Substrate Integration" title="Direct link to Substrate Integration">​</a></h4>
<p>We have chosen Substrate as the foundation for our project&#x27;s development due to a multitude of compelling reasons. Substrate provides a modular framework for blockchain development platform. By leveraging Substrate&#x27;s extensive capabilities, we could design our consensus mechanism effectively as it aligns perfectly with our goal of creating a dynamic and adaptable blockchain network. Additionally, our project envisions a future where cross-chain interoperability is a key component. This vision closely resonates with the Polkadot ecosystem, which provides of parachains ecosystem. The parachain ecosystem would help us design a robust implementation and test its interoperability. While this part is still under active research, we foresee our consensus mechanism being well-suited for integration into the broader Polkadot network. Besides, one of the most noteworthy features of Substrate is its native support for WebAssembly (Wasm) built contracts. Considering the research and future extensions, we wanted to develop the consensus on Wasm built contracts.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-interest">Team Interest<a href="#team-interest" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team Interest" title="Direct link to Team Interest">​</a></h4>
<p>Our interest in this project was sparked by a genuine enthusiasm for blockchain technology. Initially, we began as web3 developers, participating in hackathons and exploring dapp development. However, during one of these hackathons, we encountered notable limitations with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Recognizing the need for a more robust solution, our research head, Joby Reuben, who has been researching blockchain for over 4 years, began to delve into various consensus mechanisms. Proof of Contract Stake (PoCS) stemmed out from his previous research and emerged as a promising avenue, and we&#x27;ve been dedicated to refining this concept for the past eight months.As we conducted our research, we identified the need for a WebAssembly (Wasm) environment to effectively implement this mechanism. This led us to the Polkadot ecosystem, which provided a suitable environment for our vision.</p>
<p>In this landscape of ever-evolving blockchain technology we are poised to reshape the way we approach smart contracts and network security. The grants will help us validate our research and make it more robust with the para chain ecosystem. Thus, through this support, we aim to bring our vision to delivering a practical tool to the community and contributing to the ongoing evolution of blockchain technology.</p>

<p>Our <a href="https://jobyreuben.in/JOURNALS/pocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PoCS research</a> is documented. We have also included <a href="https://jobyreuben.in/JOURNALS/pocs#pocs-simulations-ethereum-pocs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">simulations</a> on the research document to show how PoCS would behave if Ethereum used PoCS from its genesis block.</p>

<p>To implement PoCS on substrate we will be modifying <code>pallet-contracts</code> and  <code>pallet-staking</code> under APACHE 2.0 license. We decided to proceed with this approach since both of these pallets provide the primary required functionalities. In addition to this substrate also provides a elaborate user interface for integrating contracts which will ease out our implementation. Since we will be implementing PoCS as a staking mechanism, we will be using <code>pallet-staking</code> with BABE + GRANDPA protocols to modify proof of stake.</p>
<h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="outline-of-core-functionality">Outline of Core functionality<a href="#outline-of-core-functionality" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Outline of Core functionality" title="Direct link to Outline of Core functionality">​</a></h4>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fields to be added to Pallet-contracts</strong>
Every newly deployed contract will have three extra storage fields:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><code>AccountStakeInfo</code> (struct) : Struct maintainted for each contract call. It is updated everytime a contract is called.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>owner</code> (AccountId) - Owner of the contract</li>
<li><code>delegateTo</code> (AccountId) - Set by the deployer and for the consensus to know who is the deployer.  Only deployer can change this field</li>
<li><code>delegateAt</code> (Blocknumber) - The field is the current block height when the delegateTo field is updated</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>ContractScarcityInfo</code> (struct field) -  This field will be used to calculate the PoCS stake score. It will be updated anytime a transaction executes which corresponds to that contract. To calculate this we will use<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>reputation</code> (u64) - a parameter we assign to calculate the reputation of contract which depends on number of times it is called by a user or any other contract</li>
<li><code>recent_blockheight</code> (BlockNumberFor) - This is introduced to prevent vulnerabilities like DDoS attack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Staking mechanism: <br>
In the context of Substrate, the integration of Babe and Grandpa protocols, alongside the Staking Pallet, complements the PoCS mechanism</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Babe&#x27;s deterministic block production process aligns with PoCS&#x27;s commitment to security. Validators with higher reputation and weight history, as determined by the scarcity mapping, are incentivized to actively participate in proposing and validating blocks</li>
<li>Staking Pallet (Validator Selection): The Staking Pallet integrates with PoCS as validators selected based on their scarcity scores, are entrusted with the responsibility of proposing and validating blocks. This delegation ensures that validators with a proven track record of actively participating in the network are granted the authority to contribute to the consensus process.</li>
<li>Validator Reward Contract : Validator reward contract will act as a general middleware contract, which could be reusable across different apps/chains built over PoCS. We will build a validator contract which will not be a definitive but a reference contract which can be modified with a custom logic to implement custom reward distribution mechanisms.<br>
Outline of some basic functionalities:<!-- -->
<ol>
<li>Claim Rewards: <code>claimRewards(address devAddress)</code>
This function allows a developer to claim their rewards from the Validator Reward. For this it will verify that the caller is the owner of the contract calling the function and ensure that the contract is delegated to the validator.</li>
<li>Calculate Reward Percentage: <code>calculateRewardPercentage(address contractAddress)</code>: This function calculates the percentage of rewards that the developer is eligible to claim based on the stake score of the associated contract.</li>
<li>Transfer Rewards: <code>transferRewards(address devAddress, uint256 rewardAmount)</code>
: This function transfers the calculated rewards to the developer from the contract. It ensures that the reward amount is valid and available in the contract.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<p>We have structured our implementation into 3 milestones. In this grant our focus is to develop a first version which would implement pallet-contract to calculate the  staking score in simplistic yet efficient way with above mentioned fields. It would handle</p>
<ul>
<li>Stake score update when deployer deploys contract</li>
<li>Stake score update when a user calls contract function or other contracts call the contract function</li>
<li>Integration with proof of stake in substrate.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will continue to research as we implement, not all vulnerabilities might be handled in the very first version with above functionalities. But we will extend it to our future plans or extend the grants after accomplishing the milestones and scope in this proposal.</p>
