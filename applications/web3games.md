### 1.2 Project Background

** Started from Polkadot Hackathon

The Web3Games team is formed of blockchain engineers with a mission to build a new game ecosystem on Polkadot. The core team met during a Substrate course co-hosted by Parity and OneBlock+, and competed against 33 other teams at the Polkadot Hackathon Demo Day to receive the Developers‚Äô Choice Award.

### 1.3 Project Integrated

SubGame is based on the Substrate 3.0 Framework. We built numbers of pallets with NFT and DeFi and deployed on our Web3Games Testnet. Besides the substrate-based network, we also provide frontend and backend game client intergration libraries for players to kickstart the blockchain gaming journey easier. For developers, we open source all our contract libraries. Through the Front EVM bridge, developers can also write contracts with Ink or Solidity and deploy to our network, bringing Web 3.0 cross chain features.

### 1.4 Project Interest

Our team is built from experienced blockchain and game developers. With highly tailor made features in Substrate, blockchain gaming can be implemented much easier and provide a better environment for players.

### 1.5 Project Details 

Web3Games includes Web3Games nodes, W3G-Integration FrameworkÔºåW3G-Game Example.
