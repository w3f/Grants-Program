## Project Overview

### Overview

A lot of blockchain applications that involve some kind of voting, like on-chain quadratic funding, can potentially be exploited via collusion and bribery (see [Vitalikâ€™s post about collusion](https://vitalik.ca/general/2019/04/03/collusion.html)). So project is focused to implement an example on substrate blockchain of MACI.

[Noc2 RFP proposal](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Open/anti-collusion_infrastructure.md)

### Project Details

I dont expected final version of an project with all alghorithms, but project architecture is looks like:
* implementing an substrate pallet, where we can create a new poll
* implement tool to call substrate pallet and create poll, to calculate result and provide result to substrate pallet using zk-snark
* implement tool for verification of calculation of pool author using zk-snark toolchain
  
Approximate scheme of architecture:

![MACI Scheme](https://github.com/zrowdev/substrate-maci/blob/main/arch.jpg?raw=true)

Coordinator will use MACI Pallet to create a new poll, then coordinator will use voting tool to create a new poll, generate keypair, sign up user in pallet, cast a vote, calculate batch of vote, tallying result of poll, verify tallied result of vote and provide result to substrate pallet using zk-snark.
So coordinator cant censorship, all users can verify result of poll.

### Ecosystem Fit

  * Our project fit to ecosystem by an example of using an a online voting application, that is realised in many blockchains with a resistant to bribery and collisions.
  * Target audience is developers/dapps
  * Our project is a part of substrate ecosystem, so we will use substrate pallets and substrate stack.
  * Different developers can use it as example to use quad vote tallying in their projects, how they can use zk-snark in their projects and etc.

## Future Plans

Implement ink! smart contract with voting example, maybe another example using this mechanism.
