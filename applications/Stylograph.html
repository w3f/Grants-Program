programming language, third party developers can extend the core functionality, while focussing on the domain logic.</p><p>The total ask for this proposal is $100,000 and it is planned to have a subsequent development to use this functionality within Genesis DAO (see the last grant, <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/GenesisDAO.md#future-plans" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future plans section</a>). </p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="introduction">Introduction<a href="#introduction" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Introduction" title="Direct link to Introduction">​</a></h3><p>A group of people surrounding Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie were quite busy at Bell Laboratories shaping the world as we know it today. They invented a milestone in programming languages — C, the breakthrough operational system Unix, the first shell, UTF-8 and a long list of others that alone would have been enough to receive a Turing award.</p><p>How were they so productive? Of course, the density of talent at Bell Labs was as high as within the Beatles (before John married) — but one tiny detail helped drive them. And that can be summed up in one word: focus. Finding out what holds the application together in its innermost folds and excelling at that. It takes writing programs that do one thing and do it well. Today, this set of guiding principles is popularly known as the Unix philosophy.</p><p>This fundamental building block of system design is what guides Substrate development today. The Polkadot ecosystem is a set of domain-specific chains that focus on building the infrastructure for the web3 universe. </p><p>The ink! programming language can be run on Substrate chains, either as a <a href="https://use.ink/how-it-works#use-case-1-smart-contracts-as-first-class-citizens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">core value proposition</a> - with the chain being an ecosystem for protocols developed in ink! on top of it - or as <a href="https://use.ink/how-it-works#use-case-2-smart-contracts-as-second-class-citizens" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">second class citizens</a> - with protocols being able to build on top of the domain logic. </p><p><em>Stylograph</em> introduces a third use-case by utilizing ink! as a configuration language to alter the domain specific language itself by introducing a simple and straightforward framework to inject loosely-coupled hook points into your pallets that will call smart contract functionality in registered contracts on the contracts pallet. </p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="motivation">Motivation<a href="#motivation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Motivation" title="Direct link to Motivation">​</a></h3><p>Deep Ink Ventures is building a system parachain for the Polkadot ecosystem that is building infrastructure for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations - Genesis DAO. </p><p>At <em>Genesis DAO</em> we are committed to the Unix philosophy. </p><p>We focus on the DAO management with the core components of creating and running DAOs, overseeing token issuance and DAO treasury and having a rock-solid proposal and voting infrastructure.</p><p>However, DAOs can have small and granular requirements that do require small tweaks and adjustments. Sometimes on-top protocols like Yield Aggregators require additional functionality. Some of those changes may be deal breaking for technical use cases or legal reasons and therefore a hard requirement for newly founded DAOs.</p><p>The core team ultimately has to decide what features are reasonably part of an unbloated core and there is no one-size-fits-all solution to a lot of problems. This is where Stylograph comes to the rescue.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="framework-components-overview">Framework Components Overview<a href="#framework-components-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Framework Components Overview" title="Direct link to Framework Components Overview">​</a></h3><p>The following is an overview of the architecture we build and is merely to sketch the scope and general concept. Implementation details may vary.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="pallet_stylograph">pallet_stylograph<a href="#pallet_stylograph" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to pallet_stylograph" title="Direct link to pallet_stylograph">​</a></h4><p>This pallet acts as an abstraction layer on top of pallet_contracts in order to conveniently create callback based implementations.</p><p>The pallet will have initial support for <em>ink!</em>. The concept is easily extendable for other languages such as <em>Solidity</em> or <em>ask!</em> that can be added.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236872194-471198c3-48d8-4acc-842b-0ac450929908.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Since Substrate does not know about the structure of smart contracts deployed in ink! beforehand, Substrate developers utilizing Stylograph need to register the function signature they want to support for callbacks.</p><p>This is a one-liner in the chain specs:</p><p>Stylograph is now aware of a function given by signature, function name or trait definition and knows its associated gas limit.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236872381-418dacb9-e776-4f5f-af0a-1c133196c2dc.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>With the callback defined, the core developers now can add callback functions into their pallets that extension developers can utilize. </p><p>For example, the function above may alter the original vote in order to come up with a more complex algorithm (and it is therefore valuable to carefully select the arguments for the callback function for extension developers to be flexible).</p><p>An example might be something like this:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236872439-2b1cc9aa-0a5f-4982-9fc2-723828e7cfb5.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The next part is the registration of extensions by accounts - the second argument given in the callback above. </p><p>The Substrate node implementation can decide how they want to interpret this - e.g. if the extensions are per account or if the account represents an entity on the chain. The latter is true for <em>Genesis DAO</em> where the account needs to be the owner of the DAO. Each DAO can register its own hookpoints to tweak the core to its needs.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236872530-d4cd6aec-03f5-4221-8cd8-a67a2b04da5f.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The framework now has all the information at hand to execute a fully abstracted _pallet_contracts::bare_call _and to handle errors associated with it:</p><ol><li>The user calls the extrinsic of the implementing pallet. In the case of GenesisDAO that might be the <em>dao_votes</em> pallet to intercept the voting process in order to alter the majority voting to a different decision system.</li><li>This pallet executes the callback that takes the information given from the <em>dao_votes</em> panel and looks up the callback definitions registers.</li><li>It constructs a call to the ink! contract defined.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236873188-5fc04a21-6d59-41c3-921a-37a8e2ece739.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>The gas fees are therefore called by the person utilizing the functionality - the user calling the initial extrinsic.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ink-stylograph-facade-builder">ink! Stylograph Facade Builder<a href="#ink-stylograph-facade-builder" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to ink! Stylograph Facade Builder" title="Direct link to ink! Stylograph Facade Builder">​</a></h4><p>The aforementioned information is enough to automagically generate a full boilerplate contract as template that Substrate chain developers can use to deploy a sample contract and to write a macro that defines the interface that the runtime expects. </p><p>This contract can be released to the extension developer community to use as a boilerplate template. They can as well import the trait for the contract to be sure that they are compatible with the specs defined by the runtime.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236872845-248bc23e-a96b-4008-8e9e-6d6cf1756d35.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>We therefore are building a CLI tool to package a versioned ink! crate with installation steps and base documentation that can be published with a new runtime release of the chain to give protocol and extension developers a headstart to extension development. Both the chain and the contract will depend on those traits as dependency to identify the interface.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/120174523/236881416-f7d622dc-2993-4b84-99c3-4b1835970372.png" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="additional-development">Additional Development<a href="#additional-development" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Additional Development" title="Direct link to Additional Development">​</a></h2><p>As this is planned to be part of our to-be-planned-system-parachain, we are as well pushing the development of the main chain within this proposal.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="token-transfer">Token Transfer<a href="#token-transfer" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Token Transfer" title="Direct link to Token Transfer">​</a></h3><p>Currently we rely on wallet extensions and polkadot.js.org to transfer DAO tokens around that reside on Genesis DAO.

We have already implemented the multisig part.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/Grants-Program/assets/120174523/68608920-3a08-4658-bb84-2f1852b42053" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="dao-dashboard-add-on">DAO Dashboard Add-On<a href="#dao-dashboard-add-on" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to DAO Dashboard Add-On" title="Direct link to DAO Dashboard Add-On">​</a></h2><p>We are createing a few designs to make the DAO Dashboard more friendly and intuitive for users and want to do the frontend implementation as well as the respective adjustments to the APIs of our backend service.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/Grants-Program/assets/120174523/3d1a5587-3bef-4d84-ad96-1a5c99c0d4c8" alt="image" class="img_ev3q"></p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h2><p>While we have drafted this pallet with the next iteration of the Genesis DAO chain in mind (<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yyEBa43plj-PzlrEnK6JT5CKqyvBDUrYiR1N6984fhk/edit#heading=h.nfot0twi37l" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here are some planned plugins and extensions for inspiration</a>), the presented functionality is carefully abstracted into a reusable component system.</p><p>Stylograph is to Substrate what plugins and and extensions were for CMS, Shops in web2 - a smooth way for third parties to extend the core functionality for a chain. It enables Substrate developers to concentrate on doing their domain logic well whilst their users and protocols building on top maximize flexibility and time-to-market.</p><p>You can think of this as the inverse to chain extension. While chain extension gives plugins a way to interact with the underlying core logic, stylograph gives chain developers an easy framework to make their core extendable with plugins and extensions via smart contracts. They can be used by any chain that wants to have a growing extension ecosystem.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team">Team<a href="#team" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team" title="Direct link to Team">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Jakob Drzazga</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> 	<a href="mailto:admin@deep-ink.ventures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">admin@deep-ink.ventures</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li>Deep Ink Ventures GmbH, registered with the commercial register at the local court of Berlin, HRB 247342</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-roadmap">Development Roadmap<a href="#development-roadmap" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Roadmap" title="Direct link to Development Roadmap">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview-1">Overview<a href="#overview-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Total Estimated Duration:</strong> 4-5 month</li><li><strong>Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):</strong>  3-4 FTE</li><li><strong>Total Costs:</strong> $ 100,000</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-status-">Development Status 📖<a href="#development-status-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Status 📖" title="Direct link to Development Status 📖">​</a></h2><p>The development will happen on <a href="https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/genesis-dao-node" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/deep-ink-ventures/genesis-dao-node</a> as we test the functionality in a full chain, but the pallet will be released as it&#x27;s own crate.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="development-roadmap-">Development Roadmap 🔩<a href="#development-roadmap-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Development Roadmap 🔩" title="Direct link to Development Roadmap 🔩">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="milestone-1">Milestone 1<a href="#milestone-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Milestone 1" title="Direct link to Milestone 1">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Estimated duration:</strong> 3 month</li><li><strong>FTE:</strong>  3-4</li><li><strong>Costs:</strong> 70,000</li></ul><table><thead><tr><th align="right">Number</th><th>Deliverable</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right"><strong>0a.</strong></td><td>License</td><td>Apache 2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>0b.</strong></td><td>Documentation</td><td>We will provide both <strong>inline documentation</strong> of the code and a basic <strong>tutorial</strong> that explains how a can integrate the pallet and start working with</td></tr><tr><td align="right"><strong>0c.</strong></td><td>Testing and Testing Guide</td><td>Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness.
