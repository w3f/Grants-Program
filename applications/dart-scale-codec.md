* **Project:** dart-scale-codec 
* **Proposer:** [NBLTrust](https://github.com/nbltrust)
* **Payment Address:** 1LcdMwwiG1Vt8UmMqUk1RLAd2MUpbeoyba 



## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
A Dart implementation of  the SCALE (Simple Concatenated Aggregate Little-Endian) Codec. We are building a wallet app called [**Jadewallet**](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/pull/338) which will support DOT/KSM, this project is a component of it.

**Jadewallet** is making a new paradigm of self-custody, which uses **multi-party computation (MPC)** and **threshold signature scheme (TSS)** technology. **MPC based Threshold Signatures** gives clients total autonomy over whose digital assets and multisignature ability with keyless cryptographic security.

We are building **Jadewallet** with Flutter, although there are Rust, C++ implementations of the SCALE Codec, we think the Dart implementation is the first choice.  And we hope the project will also help the Polkadot developer community.
