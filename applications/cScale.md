* **Project Name:** cScale
* **Team Name:** Matthew Darnell (Individual)
* **Payment Address:** `15ssDeS9peN9a3rDwFrV19YJ8oRffmphaE` (BTC)
* **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1
* **Status:** [Terminated](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/625#issuecomment-1047869564)

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

* cScale is a SCALE codec implementation in C
* Currently there does not seem to be a working standalone implementation of this serialization codec in C
* A SCALE implementation would allow for the development of more desktop applications communicating with Substrate nodes
* I am developing this because I am interested in creating a simple and secure desktop Substrate wallet
* I already have a generally working product that I would also like to improve as I get suggestions

### Project Details

* Technology stack will be a simple C library, mostly in C99 with a few uses of C11 `_Generic`. One dependency currently will be included which is an open sourced, single file, pure-header utf8 implementation useful for SCALE string encoding.
* Makefile is included but can do simple CMakeLists.txt if preferred
* Supported Data Types will be:
  * Fixed Width Integers
  * Compact/General Integers
  * Booleans
  * Options
  * Vectors (and Strings)
  * Enumerations
  * Tuples
  * User-Defined Data Structures
* Some limitations and caveats:
  * C does not support `uint128_t` types. Possible options are to introduce a 3rd party dependency or consume `u128` values encoded as `char*` strings. GCC does provide a `uint128_t` extension but I'm not sure how universal this is and C does not support sufficiently long literal int values. Currently I am able to encode from a hex-represented `u128` but could consume decimal represented `char*` strings if required.
  * Enumerations are tricky to implement as they are user-defined. I am able to construct a `struct` which generates a custom enum type by consuming an array of strings of different types, e.g. `[Int, Bool]`, but I am not sure how to make this very clean for the user.
  * A lack of templating and type inference makes encoding/decoding user-defined `struct` values a little difficult. I am able to achieve this by defining a custom `struct` which contains a `serialize` as well as `deserialize` function pointer. The user will be able to include this `struct ` in his data structure and assign his own custom function. This works fine, but again, it is a little more in depth for the end user than ideal.
  * With each of these, I would love feedback from others on how to improve the library!
### Ecosystem Fit

* The target audience are Desktop C/C++ developers who would like to be able to encode and decode Substrate API data
* Similar Projects
  * Kagome (C++ and not intended for standalone library use)
  * FinoaBanking substrate-c-tool (Has not been updated for over a year and is in unknown state of completion as far as I can tell)

## Development Status :open_book:

Currently have a basic working implementation. Generating a testing app, a basic cli app, and a statically linked library.

Some examples:

#### Fixed Int
```c
scale_fixed_int fixed = { 0 };
encode_int_to_fixed_int_scale(&fixed, (uint16_t)42);
uint8_t serialized[64] = { 0 };
size_t serialized_len = 0;
serialize_fixed_int(serialized, &serialized_len, &fixed);

uint16_t output = 0;
decode_scale_fixed_int((void*)&output, &fixed);

for(int i=0; i < serialized_len; i++) printf("%02X", serialized[i]);
printf(" --- %u\n", output);
```

Prints:
```shell
2A00 --- 42
```

#### Compact Int

```c
 scale_compact_int compact = { 0 };
  encode_compact(&compact, (uint32_t)69);
  uint8_t serialized[64] = { 0 };
  size_t serialized_len = 0;
  char *output = decode_compact_to_hex(&compact);
  serialize_compact_int(serialized, &serialized_len, &compact);
  uint32_t decoded = strtoul(output, NULL, 16);
  printf("SCALE=<");
  for(int i=0; i < serialized_len; i++) printf("%02X", serialized[i]);
  printf("> --- Hex=<%s> --- Decoded=<%u>\n", output, decoded);
  free(output);
```

Prints:
```shell
SCALE=<1501> --- Hex=<45> --- Decoded=<69>
```


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1 FTE
* **Total Costs:** 10,000 USD, denominated in Bitcoin

### Milestone 1 - Working Product

* **Estimated duration:** 2 weeks
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 9,000 USD in BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | GPLv3|
| 0b. | Documentation | I will provide a README with several examples as well as a .c file for each data type with several tests showing encoding and decoding. I will also provide a `docs` folder containing a markdown file giving examples for each data type as well as commenting  each function in the main header file. |
| 1. | Intermediate Structs | I will provide a set of Structs which represent SCALE data internally before being processed |  
| 2. | Encode | I will provide a set of functions that encode data into intermediate structs as well as others to serialize them. Each will generate an array of `uint8_t*` as well as a corresponding length |  
| 3. | Decode | I will provide a set of functions that decode a valid SCALE `uint8_t*` array into the appropriate intermediate struct as well as functions to deserialize the struct back into raw data |  
| 4. | Testing | I will provide a testing application which tests each data type and ensures correctness |
| 5. | Basic CLI | I will provide a basic command line interface app which will encode/decode fixed width and compact integers |

### Milestone 2 - Additional testing

* **Estimated duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 1,000 USD in BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | GPLv3|
| 0b. | Documentation | I will add several useful structs to the docs folder which represent actual Substrate data with their respective serialization functions. (AccountInfo, AccountData) |
| 1. | Tests | I will work to provide more tests, preferably utilizing Rust FFI to compare against parity-scale-code results. This may or may not require some assistance as I have never used Rust FFI. |  


## Future Plans

* I am writing this library to use in my own personal desktop wallet application
* I see a real need for it to allow the Substrate community to grow and I hope it makes it on the official list of [Scale Implementations](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/advanced/codec#implementations)
* Long term I would be interested in improving this library to keep current with a possibly-evolving SCALE standard as well as getting help from other C devs making pull requests, which would be most welcome. 

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Shawn Tabrizi

* This started as a personal project and I would like to assist in expanding the Substrate ecosystem by providing a critical element of its infrastructure in C
