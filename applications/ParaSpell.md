## Project Overview  üìÑ

### Overview üí°

XCM & XCMP related development tool for developers.

ParaSpell main advantages can be summarized in the following list:

- ParaSpell is a platform that allows developers to use specific XCM & XCMP related tasks from a user-friendly interface.
- ParaSpell focuses on ease of use, broad scale of use cases, and bringing XCM & XCMP utilization & documentation closer to developers.
- ParaSpell guarantees to be a completely decentralized, open-source platform that does not collect any user data.

One of the ParaSpell main goals is to reduce the time necessary to create XCM calls or open HRMP channels.

](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/comparisonImg.jpg)

As we can see in the figure above, the amount of details the user has to fill to transfer the XCM message is drastically reduced. As an example, users do not need to specify a specific route from origin to destination chain. These details are filled for them.

Another goal of ParaSpell is having network installation, compilation & startup done as simply as possible. This is achieved by makefile that groups commands into fewer much more intuitive commands and by network startup configuration file. Together, these two files take care of the network side, and adding new nodes into these files is intuitive.  Starting the application is also very simple and done by one command. Communication between application and network is made possible with Polkadot API libraries.

ParaSpell focuses mainly on substrate developers. Added value comes from being user friendly SDK for simplifying development by saving time necessary to install & launch network, open HRMP channels or create XCM transfers between nodes available in network.

Overall ParaSpell is all about developer experience.

### Project Details üéØ

ParaSpell in its current form allows developers to install all dependencies as well as a network consisting of Rococo, Pichiu(Kylin network), Bifrost & Acala nodes with one command. Launching a network is also done by one command. Once the network is installed and started ParaSpell application allows developers to open/close HRMP channels between mentioned parachains. In current progress ParaSpell already has user interface and main functionality almost finished.

The following screen allows the user to open the HRMP channels between list of parachains pulled from Rococo by API call.

](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/Open%20channel.png)

Closing HRMP channels is just as simple as opening them. One button click to close the required channel.

](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/close%20channel.png)

If the user decides to transfer funds from Relay chain to Parachain they can do so by filling following details. These required details are way faster to fill than filling a full XCM call which requires a complete route and selection of concrete token.

](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/relay%20to%20para.png)

The opposite, but nearly the same scenario is sending tokens from Parachain to Relay chain. It is just as simple, however.

](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/para%20to%20relay.png)

The last transaction scenario is the transfer of funds between Parachain and another Parachain.

#### Architecture üèó

[
![Diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/screenFlow.svg)
](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dudo50/Polkachange/main/img/screenFlow.svg)

Application is purposely designed to be as simple as possible. This guarantees, that all tasks can be done quickly and without extended searching. All necessary screens also feature notifications which will as a milestone explain be callback reactive. The loading screen is only present on the first application & network startup, once accessing the same screen after the application was loaded it will be skipped automatically. The screen serves to register necessary assets in parachain nodes. This is only required to be run once per network startup.

#### Technology Stack üíª

- Vue.js
- Node.js
- Typescript
- Polkadot api libraries
- Make
- Polkadot launch
- Substrate compatible nodes (For now Rococo, Pichiu(Kylin network), Bifrost & Acala)

### Ecosystem Fit üåø

There are not many XCM & XCMP related development tools released currently. We aim to aid this mostly empty space and help developers to understand XCM & XCMP as the current state-of-the-art technology by providing documentation and a user interface in which they can do development tasks more easily and faster.

In Polkadot and Kusama ecosystem, there are few XCM & XCMP related Dapps in development. These rather focus on standard users mostly. One of mentioned type is called "Morph".

Unlike the already mentioned "Morph" platform ParaSpell focuses more on developers. ParaSpell features complete network install and startup configuration in one single command. This automatization ensures, that developers do not need to do any extra tasks when they wish to run development nodes locally. ParaSpell also allows developers to open and close HRMP channels between Parachains they connected. Like "Morph", ParaSpell can also transfer fungible tokens in three scenarios. From Parachains to Relay chain, from Relay chain to Parachains & from Parachains to Parachains.

Our target audiences can be Web3 projects & starting/current blockchain developers.

## Future Plans üî≠

Once everything will be implemented according to the proposed plan application will still be under constant improvement as technology will progress. For example, once the XCMP protocol will be released we wish to deprecate the HRMP protocol we currently use for channels.

In a long run, we also want to improve design, add new features that can be useful for developers, support for new nodes, and ability to add a new node from the user interface.
