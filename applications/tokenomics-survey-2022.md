## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

A annotated bibliography of rational expectations equilibrium (a.k.a. no-arbitrage) economic models used to develop blockchain/token economies, as well as the tokenomics of Polkadot Parachains.

This is a survey, hence limited to topics the existing literature addresses. Within the scope of the deliverables, I am not committing to solving any particular token-economy design question.
The report/working paper will be posted to [SSRN (e.g. FEN - Cryptocurrency Research eJournal)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=3839004), [IDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/), [Arxiv (q-fin.GN)](https://arxiv.org/list/q-fin.GN/recent).

- Description:
  The decision making of developers (and other stakeholders) is assisted if a hypothetical/proposed token-economy can be described by reference, or analogy, to a known working/successful token-economy. Absent an existing implementation, developers are left to invent a token-economy, try to adapt an existing non-blockchain experience to a blockchain, or try to adapt non-blockchain ideas to a blockchain.
- This project provides a annotated bibliography to help think through various choices and their trade-offs. It does so by reviewing the current state of play, as it is described in: a) published general-blockchain research, b) Polkadot whitepapers. It does not offer the answer to any particular token-economy design question.
- With general Token-Economy networks in mind, I aim to provide a annotated bibliography of existing general-blockchain token-economy research.
  For practical context, the central features and concerns across Polkadot Parachain Token-Economy networks will be identified.
  Ultimately, the reader should learn something about those features of the token-economies of Polkadot Parachain  networks and understand how some of the issues raised by the general-blockchain token-economy research are addressed by Polkadot Parachain token-economy designs, while others are not.
  Summary tables will highlight the key differentiating characteristics of different Polkadot Parachain  network token-economies.
- Motivation:
  A project we are developing envisions the use of the [Open Web3 Stack](https://github.com/open-web3-stack) relay and Parachains in such a manner that our (imagined) token use is, apparently, novel. The state of play in Polkadot Parachain token-economics appears to be a debate [around staking and inflation](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/should-parachains-have-staking-inflation/806). A search of docs.substrate.io for "tokenomics" and "token-economics" returns no results. We had expected a reference to, or high-level summary of, the token-economies of parachains elected to the Polkadot relay chain.  Ideally, we hoped to find high level descriptions of some token-economy features that are enabled by the distinct features of the [Open Web3 Stack](https://github.com/open-web3-stack) and its pallets, possibly with links to case studies or other resources. This annotated bibliography will provide some of that information.

## Project Details

### The problem

A search of docs.substrate.io for "tokenomics" and "token-economics" returns no results. We had expected a reference to, or high-level summary of, the token-economies of parachains elected to the Polkadot relay chain.  Ideally, we hoped to find high level descriptions of some token-economy features, possibly with links to case studies or other resources. This annotated bibliography will provide some of that information.  Inclusion of this information in any documentation is out of scope.

### Research questions/hypothesis

This project provides a annotated bibliography to identify relevant research, it does not offer the answer to any particular token-economy design question. It does so using: a) published general-blockchain research, b) Polkadot whitepapers.

### The Methodology

The annotated bibliography component of this exercise will be closest to a "Scoping Review", see Grant MJ, Booth A. [A typology of reviews: an analysis of 14 review types and associated methodologies](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-1842.2009.00848.x). Health Info Libr J. 2009 Jun; 26(2):91-108. Review. PubMed PMID: 19490148.

Extract from Table 1 of Grant, M.J. and Booth, A. (2009):

| Description | Search | Appraisal | Synthesis | Analysis |
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | --------- | -------- |
|  Preliminary assessment of potential size and scope of available research literature. Aims to identify nature and extent of research evidence (usually including ongoing research) | Completeness of searching determined by time/scope constraints. May include research in progress | No formal quality assessment | Typically tabular with some narrative commentary | Characterizes quantity and quality of literature, perhaps by study design and other key features. Attempts to specify a viable review |

Each section of the report/working paper will be developed using some subset of the following iterative process (Tsafnat, G., Glasziou, P., Choong, M.K. et al. [Systematic review automation technologies](https://doi.org/10.1186/2046-4053-3-74), Syst Rev 3, 74 (2014))

- Review reporting guidelines, best practice handbooks, and training modules [preparation stage]
- Formulate question and decide on review type [preparation stage]
- Search for previous published literature [preparation stage]
- Develop and test search strategies [preparation stage]
- Review search strategies [preparation stage]
- Execute search [retrieval stage]
- De-duplicate data/information [retrieval stage]
- Screen title and abstracts [screening stage]
- Retrieve full-text articles [retrieval stage]
- Screen articles in full-text [screening stage]
- Search for grey literature (preprints, working papers) [retrieval stage]
- Quality assessment and data/information extraction [synthesis stage]
- Citation chasing [retrieval stage]
- Update database searches [retrieval stage]
- Synthesize data/information [synthesis stage]
- Manuscript development [write-up stage]

### The data collection and analysis procedures

#### Published articles

The initial source of the published research will be the top-6 articles selected by the grantee, using the commercial research databases available from the State Library of New South Wales by operationalizing the following inquiry, "Refereed articles on block-chain token-economics using rational expectations equilibrium (a.k.a. no-arbitrage) arguments/analysis, ranked by journal impact factors". This initial source may be adjusted at the grantees discretion based on his expertise.  The selection process will be fully described and documented.

#### Polkadot Parachain whitepapers

These are from projects that are Polkadot-Parachains as at 19 December 2022.

### The expected results

The objective is to arrive at a scoping review of current state of token-economy development.

One of the elements will be summary tables, using attributes that arise naturally within a Rational Expectations Equilibrium framework, such as the following:

- Network
- Token
- Token Type
- Model Type
- Economy Type
- Sector Type
- Production Type
- Monetary Type
- Agent Utility
- Economic Sectors
- Rate Curves
- Riskless Rate
- Risk Premium
- Market Rate
- Borrow/Lend
- Lender of Last Resort

Another component of this research is creating a token-categorization questionnaire or decision tree that will aid/inform the specification of a token-economy. Nonetheless, there are already schemes that are useful even at this early stage. Such as these [Token Types (Burnie, Burnie and Henderson (2018))](https://doi.org/10.5195/ledger.2018.121):

- fuel-tokens: "underpin generic blockchain applications". I refine this definition as follows: The token yield is defined or modeled such that it provides holders with incentives to act for the purpose of ensuring the blockchain has the desired features/characteristics.
- transaction-tokens: "act as a cash substitute"
- voucher-tokens: "exchanged for a predefined asset". I include goods or services.

The grants team, and any reader could reproduce the data analysis by applying the token-categorization questionaire to a parachain they are familiar with and compare their classification with the submitted result.

### Intended venue for results publication and the timeline for publication

The report/working paper will be posted to [SSRN (e.g. FEN - Cryptocurrency Research eJournal)](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/JELJOUR_Results.cfm?form_name=journalBrowse&journal_id=3839004), [IDEAS](https://ideas.repec.org/), [Arxiv (q-fin.GN)](https://arxiv.org/list/q-fin.GN/recent).

### Out of scope

- Crypto currencies/stable coins.
- What is considered a security and what is not.
- Proof-of-work vs Proof-of-stake considerations, e.g. [Blockchain economics](https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/markus/files/blockchain_paper_v7a.pdf).
- Governance considerations, e.g. trust and reputation.
- Game theory, behavioral economics/finance.
- Empirical inference of token-economy attributes from time-series or cross-sectional regression analysis.
- A review of the general economic modeling literature i.e. not related to blockchains.
- Verifying the network token-economy has been implemented as specified in the network whitepaper.
- Verifying the network whitepaper assumptions are a reasonable/plausible description of the network participants.
- Inclusion of any of this information in any project documentation.

#### Crypto-Currencies

The prevalence of crypto-currencies means the decision to exclude them warrants some explanation.
Equilibria are generally explicitly constructed (which proves existence) using conjectured properties of the dividends (or an equivalent) from the economic activity. Specifically, a price is the present-value (i.e. discounted for time and non-diversifiable risk), of all future dividends. Since the dividends of fiat currencies are zero this approach does not work. While there are workarounds, they, being particular, are not of interest in the more general setting we wish to bring to light.
