# W3F Open Grant Request


* **Project Name:** Wika Network (temporary prototype name)
* **Team Name:** Web Registry DAO
* **Payment Address:** 0xBfc8cDb5617eE0F83794156ABD7465730E125cE3 (USDT)



## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

#### Make the Internet a Better Place.

Our mission is to build a clean, public and non-intrusive blockchain registry to empower 
authors, search engines and recommendation systems that respect privacy and are 100% transparent.

- **Content Consumers** will be able to like their favorite pages and reward the authors and previous likers.

- **Authors** will register their ownership in one public decentralized database, and whether their content lives in youtube, 
facebook, medium or any other internet place, Wika users will be able to reward them directly.
 
#### Why?

Because there are too many Like buttons out there!

Each one generates data in private databases that are often used to optimize for advertisment or hidden agendas.

Our idea is pretty simple: why not a clean and transparent version of those?
It could be used on any platform, with a genuine mission to improve the internet and recommend quality content.
  
Having worked as Data Scientists and Engineers in the AI space, 
we recognize the power of ML and its risks, and we believe regulations will always be one step behind 
the evolution of software systems and artificial intelligence applications. 
From our experience, the only real user data protection comes from the ethics -and also the expertise- of the teams designing the systems. 

So internet users are actually putting a great deal of trust 
into the teams building their social networks and handling their data.

Sometimes, those teams fail, by accident, incompetence, or bad intention; 
a couple of stories will pop-up in tech news; the responsible company will be fined;
and some users might even get a coupon or free services if they manage to go through a tricky claim process.

Usually, lawyers are the most fortunate actors in those stories, 
because they are the happy few taking the biggest cut of all the money flowing from the investigation and trial phases
all the way to the settlement and money distribution time.

Ironically enough: most of the users, the actual victims, 
will probably not even notice nor understand what happened to their data.

But the damages are real at the person level: stolen personal information, fraud and identity theft; 
and this will seriously hurt the victims.

At the global level of society, when data is used unethically, that means discrimination, public opinion abuse, stock market manipulation, 
social network addictions, just to name a few we already know about; plus all the negative long term effects still to be learnt. 

Long story short: data protection and algorithmic ethics are great responsibilities 
centralized into a few powerful entities.
 
So why are we building this? Because we are engaged in solving this problem to make the internet a better place, 
and we believe that with blockchain technology and Polkadot ecosystem, 
we have all the necessary foundations and ingredients to succeed: 

- Trustless design.
- Decentralization.
- Transparency.
- Anonimity.
- Security.

    - **Offchain API** 
      - Not started yet.
    
    - **Integrations** 
      - Not started yet.  
    
        
* UI design:
    - The web app and the browser extension are already 
    available to test the UI, iterate and improve the design.
    Follow the [Testing](https://www.wika.network/docs/contribute/test-browser-ext) guide to give it a try.

* Data models and code of the core functionality:
    - [Likes pallet](https://github.com/randombishop/wika_node/blob/master/pallets/likes/src/lib.rs)
    - [Owners pallet](https://github.com/randombishop/wika_node/blob/master/pallets/owners/src/lib.rs)
    
* Technology stack:
    - Blockchain: Substrate.
    - Web App: React JS.
    - Browser Extension: Pure JS, compatible both Chrome and Firefox.
    - Indexed databases: ETL written in NodeJS, data stored in Elastic Search (URL documents) and Neo4J (social network.) 
    - Offchain API: NodeJS web services.
    - Website and documentation: Docusaurus. 
    
* Documentation:
    - [Wika Website](https://www.wika.network/docs/intro)
 
* PoC:
    - [Blockchain TestNet](https://telemetry.polkadot.io/#list/Wika%20TestNet) deployed.
    - [Web App](https://app.wika.network/) deployed.
    - [Browser Extension](https://github.com/randombishop/wika_browser_ext) can be installed from source.
    
* What Wika Network _is_ vs is _not_:
    - **IS:** Wika Network main product is the blockchain until we reach 
    a fully decentralized governance and maintenance process.
    
    - **IS:** Wika Network also comes with a web app and a browser extension. 
    Ultimately, we hope that alternatives will emerge with different approaches, 
    but until then, we will commit to building the front-end tools to facilitate 
    understanding, onboarding and interacting with the blockchain with the best UX. 
  
    - **IS NOT:** We will also be developing offchain indexed databases and APIs, 
    a recommender system prototype, 
    plugins for website developers, and other tools as our idea evolves. 
    But we think of those as simple PoC implementations to kick-start 
    all the components of the future ecosystem and test their interactions.
    
   
    

### Ecosystem Fit

* The blockchain side is developed using Substrate, 
with the intention to become a Kusama/Polkadot Parachain in the future.

* The front-end relies on the polkadot-js extension to manage signatures.

* The spirit of the design and architecture is minimalism: 
implement one simple registry and social contract, and plug to other ecosystem components to grow the capabilities.

* Target audience: internet users familiar with Polkadot wallet and blockchains, 
with the desire to make a positive contribution and protect their data.
(This will be the core community, 
then it should spread from this niche to a broader audience by educating and convincing more users.)

* Main needs met by our blockchain: 
    - Webpage to Owner registry
    - Universal Like Button

* Other projects similar in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem: 
    - Not found.

* LikeCoin seems to be a similar initiative built with Cosmos SDK, 
but we believe our design is simpler.

## Future Plans

The final goal of the Foundation phase is to reach 10,000 active users.

Please review our [Roadmap](https://www.wika.network/roadmap) 
for a high level view of our 3-phases plan. 

At the technical level, once we achieve the above milestones, 
we will be in a good position to start implementing governance aspects, audit and harden the codebase and grow the community.

We will also work next on a bridge to a DEX to create the means to ramp in and out the chain.

In parallel, we will also need to think more about the probably most important question of the design:
what is the incentive for end-users?

There are different components to answer that question:

1. Be generous.
2. Be against centralized obscure privacy-invasive systems.
3. Earn rewards.
4. Build a reputation.  

1, 2 and 3 are already designed for, while 4 is TBD; but as we build and grow the user base, 
we should have more data and a better understanding of this question.
 
In addition to the data, by having an open conversation in the community, 
we should converge to the optimal mix of those components and parameters.

An other interesting question is if we should implement a **Dislike Button** 
and what economic and social model could apply in that use case.

We can consider different models and run simulations to understand the possible patterns 
and risks that could emerge from the system.

In summary, we see the development of the foundations phase -and the near future- 
as an iterative process where we will learn from the community. 



## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How we heard about the Grants Program?** 

Web3 Foundation Website 

**Context of our request**

Beyond the financial aspect of the grant, which will help motivate and reward contributors, 
one of our key objectives is to introduce our project to Web3 / Polkadot / Substrate communities.

Also, though  all team members have proven track records of expertise and success in their particular fields, 
we are aware that we are still "beginners" when it comes to blockchain and Substrate. 
As such, being able to present our project to a panel of experts, gather feedback and learn, would be fantastic for our team.

So if our Grant request were to be approved, 
it would generate the right connections; and we would be set up for success to improve our blockchain codebase and graduate to mainnet afterwards.

For these reasons, we are looking forward to starting a conversation with W3F, 
and as we learn, we are very open to re-visiting this request's scope and form together.
