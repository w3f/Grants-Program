### Overview

This application is a follow up from our previous [grant application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1933)

Cyborg Network is developing a DePIN based marketplace for edge computing servers to help AI and IoT companies boost their performance while curbing the cloud operations cost, all without necessitating a shift from their current cloud setups. Our vision is to act as a crucial middleware on the network's edge, managing specific low-latency tasks and reduce the costs associated with cloud operations, all the while complementing existing cloud services. As a premier venture of this nature in the Polkadot landscape, our network effortlessly allows providers to integrate their machines, rewarding them for their invaluable contribution.

We establish connections with small to medium-sized data centers to address the demands of enterprise-level clients, ensuring that their requirements are fully met. Our primary emphasis lies in delivering tailored service packages, meticulously designed for diverse deployment scenarios. Our overarching goal is to provide users with a service experience reminiscent of the Web 2.0 era.

We are embarking on an ambitious mission to establish ourselves as a Polkadot and Kusama parachain. Our decision is anchored in several key reasons:

First, we're enticed by their advanced interoperable features, such as shared security and XCM. These functionalities pave the way for seamless integrations with other projects within the ecosystem. We have already initiated talks with a few ecosystem teams like [Peaq](https://www.peaq.network/), [Tanssi](https://www.tanssi.network/), [Oak Network](https://oak.tech/) for potential integrations

Second, the unparalleled ecosystem and technical support provided by Polkadot and Kusama have been instrumental in our development, and we've had the privilege of closely collaborating with them over the years.

Lastly, the substrate framework stands out as the premier tool for crafting blockchains from the ground up in today's landscape. Our commitment to excellence aligns with the capabilities it offers.

### Project Details

#### Architecture:

The core of our computing solution relies on both off-chain components and substrate pallets that work harmoniously with each other.

Cyborg is a fusion of a blockchain network and numerous computing clusters, collaborating to offer an effective decentralized solution for verifiable off-chain computing.

Our initial technological goal is to develop a system capable of validating computational outcomes from one off-chain cluster by re-executing them in another using pallet logic.

The Substrate blockchain primarily serves as the framework for deploying containered tasks and facilitating smart contracts related to billing functions.

Once the docker container is deployed, its workload will be protected by software based measures to prevent data leakage.

It seamlessly integrates with the current cloud-native toolchain for developers, typically avoiding the need for code changes.
 
Developers can monitor details such as resource utilization and application health status through the Cyborg Connect application dashboard.

### Work Verification System

For this grant application, we are developing a decentralized task verification mechanism to incorporate an on-chain validation system for containerized tasks executed in an off-chain environment. The main components will include the Cyborg AppChain, which will be deployed on Tanssi's Dancebox testnet, the client interface (K3s worker system), an Oracle, and a testing suite.

![Screenshot 2024-02-15 at 1 09 56â€¯PM](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/Grants-Program/assets/93442895/add65d92-0bf6-40df-a3fb-715fc0efce54)

The objective is to upload a Docker configuration file and deploy the container inside one of the worker nodes of the K3s cluster. Before deploying the user's Docker image, the system will run a simulation to check for compilation failures or any startup runtime issues. If there are none, we will then proceed with the deployment.

Deployment will follow this pattern: The system will submit the job to 'N' clusters, with 'N' being selectable by the user. However, we will set a minimum value for 'N' to ensure a baseline of accuracy and high fault tolerance. Users can increase the value of 'N' if they desire greater accuracy and fault tolerance. Among the chosen 'N' clusters, 40-50% will be highly trusted nodes, with the remainder being general/new nodes. This strategy ensures that customers receive a valid output. Despite this, the executed computation results will be pushed to the Oracle, which will then feed it to the Cyborg substrate chain. Subsequently, if the baseline accuracy is achieved, the result will be added to the block, and if the output does not match or there are deployment failures, the system will attempt to re-execute the job from the beginning, with a maximum of 'X' retries. The value of 'X' will be adjusted based on the cost calculations for each execution, which are yet to be determined. If the job continues to fail even after 'X' retries, the system will notify the user of the failure by providing detailed logs and request them to assess the reason for the failure. In case of deployment failures, we will assess whether the issue is due to missed edge cases, configuration issues, network instability, or hardware limitations. Based on this assessment, the system will reassign the job to different workers

### Ecosystem Fit

Cyborg Network augments the Polkadot ecosystem by ushering in decentralized edge computing, crucial for the growing demand of AI and IoT applications. By primarily catering to Web2 application providers, we're paving the way for a fresh wave of users to engage with the Polkadot ecosystem, fueling its expansion.

Though Cyborg and the [Phala Network](https://phala.network/) share aspirations of decentralized computing within the Polkadot/Kusama environment, our technical paths and business aspirations are distinct. Phala Network provides off-chain compute infrastructure for smart contract-based applications by enabling users to integrate 'phat' contracts with their existing smart contract logic. While Cyborg is focused on creating utility for web2 applications.

Another related project appears to be [Wetee](https://github.com/wetee-dao), which employs a comparable technical architecture utilizing TEEs to safeguard user privacy. However, their specific market focus is currently untraceable. We are developing products for a validated market that has already attracted interest from various AI applications and 50 small data center providers to join the network once it goes live.

Our ultimate goal is to establish a decentralized edge computing network capable of executing targeted low-latency tasks to enhance system performance and efficiency. This approach aims to reduce the overall cloud footprint by providing an edge-to-cloud continuum, allowing users to augment our services with their existing cloud deployments. This, in turn, opens up new markets, particularly in real-time computation for edge AI and edge IoT devices.

The technological landscape sees a plethora of competitors, each carving their niche with unique technical and market strategies. Renowned names include [Akash Network](https://akash.network/), and [Golem](https://www.golem.network/) .

## Development Status :open_book:

We initially developed a Rust WebSocket client with a low-key profile, ensuring a seamless connection with our blockchain through off-chain workers. Additionally, we created a proof of concept based on this client. Our initial plan was to proceed with this development. However, based on the recommendation from the W3F grants team during our [previous application](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1933) to eliminate centralized entities from our architecture and establish a fully decentralized system from the ground up, we embarked on several research iterations.

Through this process, we identified the potential of using connected clusters than indivdual instances for better management efficiency, We are currently building an on chain work verifcation system. Our team will shift focus to building custom pallets outlined in the technical architecture to steer our way through to become a parachain on Kusama and eventually on Polkadot.

As part of our transition, we are migrating from WebSockets to utilizing Libp2p as the core connection protocol. Furthermore, Subxt will serve as the standard communication protocol facilitating interaction between the Substrate chain and the off-chain domain. This strategic shift aligns with our commitment to adopting decentralized principles and enhancing the robustness of our system architecture.

We have created a UX demo for a potential user and the development for this grant will look very similar to this [Cyborg Network UX demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrN4TRMDd5ON2xH9F00upcyK-3ofwV4r/view?usp=drivesdk)
