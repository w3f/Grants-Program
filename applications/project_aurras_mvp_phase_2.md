## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This is an application for a follow-up grant: https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/163

### Overview

Aurras is a middleware that acts as an event processor and a low code workflow orchestration platform. Aurras is being pitched as a next-generation system for enabling decentralized push notification. This middleware solution listens to events from blockchain applications and propagates them to a registered pool of MQTT brokers. The broader architecture consist of parachain from which the middleware listens for the events.

Aurras as a part of Substrate / Kusama / Polkadot / Web 3 Ecosystem
* A core part of Decentralized Push Notification Architecture
* Can be used for business-critical and production-grade IoT devices to listen to events from blockchain
* Can be used with microservices across industry verticals
* Can be expanded to get integrated with data analytics, knowledge visualization, and machine and deep learning (ML/DL) algorithms

#### Technologies

1. [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org) is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers. The OpenWhisk platform supports a programming model in which developers write functional logic (called Actions), in any supported programming language, that can be dynamically scheduled and run in response to associated events (via Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or from HTTP requests
2. [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. Message brokers are used for a variety of reasons (to decouple processing from data producers, to buffer unprocessed messages, etc.). In comparison to most messaging systems, Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance which makes it a good solution for large scale message processing applications.
3. [Tackle box](https://robcxyz.github.io/tackle-box/) is a declarative DSL for building modular utilities and code generators. Tackle box is plugins based and can easily be extended by writing additional hooks or importing external providers creating a web of interoperable CLIs.
4. Docker 
5. Rust  
6. Go

#### Components

**1. Event Sources (Substrate Event Feed)**  
This is the source for events from the blockchain and the events will be sent to the OpenWhisk system. The MVP event source will be implemented using [polkadot-js/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api). For the actual implementation, we will be using a custom version of the substrate archive. Substrate archive will be indexing the blocks and an event actor will be decoding the events and data from the block and posting them to the OpenWhisk system. 

The indexer will use a NoSQL database to store the last indexed block and metadata. Using the substrate indexer as our event source will help us in solving many challenges ranging from fault tolerance to scalability to uniquely identifying multiple events with the same payload within a single block. The indexer will be connected to a substrate-based chain and RocksDB where the chain data is stored. When a new block is produced by the chain, the indexer collects the raw blocks from the RocksDB and sends it to the event actor. The event actor processes the block. The block data is decoded using the parity scale codec and mapped with the data types provided to the runtime. Once the event is decoded, the event actor posts a trigger to the event trigger manager.  

**2. Event Trigger Manager**  
Event trigger manager is composed of multiple OpenWhisk actions, including a database to store trigger URLs and their respective auths, the Kafka provider, consumer and producer. Once the event manager receives an event from the event feed, this data is produced to a topic. The feed action in the trigger manager lets the user hook into the system. That is, once an event is indexed to a particular topic, it can invoke a particular action. While creating the workflow, users can choose the event trigger as feed and provide necessary parameters from which chain it should be listening to and from which block it should start listening.

Under the hood, a feed action is invoked with create lifecycle, which accepts the mandatory parameters the lifecycle, auth, trigger name, and other optional parameters of the event source. The feed action invokes the related actions of creating the entry in the database, adding to the Kafka consumer group, etc. The next component in the event trigger manager is a persistent connection to Kafka where it is used to produce and consume the stream of data. Once data is received in Kafka, the event trigger manager invokes the action to check the consumer groups for that particular topic and if found any, the trigger for the users under that particular group is invoked, which in turn invokes the workflow.  

**3. Workflow Composer**  
The workflow composer is at the heart of Aurras and is responsible for composing and deploying the necessary workflows. It consists of an async Rust library to compose multiple triggers, a deployment configuration generator, providers for Tackle Box, several operators, macros and a whisk deployment tool.

To create a workflow, the only necessary input is the YAML configuration file. The composition, direction of flow and tasks are laid out in the YAML file. This YAML is parsed using Tackle Box, which in turn composes it into a WASM which can be deployed to OpenWhisk. Once deployed to a namespace, each workflow will have a unique workflow id.

Workflow configuration comprises the endpoint URL for workflow tasks, the sequence of processing tasks, and argument structure. Arguments must match the task input parameters.
 
**4. Web API Gateway and Backend Service**   
This is the end-user facing component that enables easy and intuitive usage of Aurras. This final component is has a backend application that provides user registration, workflow registration and workflow management. Users can also easily create, select or manage workflows along with providing the necessary input parameters.
