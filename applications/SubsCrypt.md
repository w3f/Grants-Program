# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** SubsCrypt
* **Team Name:** OxyDev
* **Payment Address:** 


## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
**SubsCrypt** is a BaaS(BlockChain as a service) for developers to facilitate integration of their subscription methods on the PolkaDot blockchain using a smart contract and a dashboard panel for admins to gather useful business data of their subscribed users(by perserving the privacy of users) and also a dashboard panel for users to manage all their subscriptions in one place.

### Overview
**SubsCrypt** focuses on sovling a traditional problem in both user and devloper side. Developers will no more be worried about privacy of and maintaing the customers database and payment mechanism, by using **SubsCrypt**, they can integrate Web3 in their service to benefit from blockchain in a developer freindly way(minimum time and expertise resource). Users will also enjoy the privacy that they can preserve and the all-in-one platform that they can manage their subscriptions in diffrent services. By making all these precedure easy, we can help small online businessed to enjoy the benefits of **Web3** and to only focus on their service which will hopefully leads to mass-adoption of **Web3**

We have been developing on different web3 technologies but none of them could satisfy our requirments for customisability, by using Substrate we can customise our parachain so it can fit our needs(we are also willing to connect to be a PolkaDot parachain)


In our country, we have a lot of restrictions and censorship. We are suffering from Iran's government's Strict policies and getting banned from universal communities and worldwide payment (e.g., PayPal and visa card) all because we are Iranian.
Two months ago, our team started this idea to resolve these limits and connect our people to the world. and now, we are going to announce our project as a service on blockchain to spread this type of freedom to the world.
besides of this, we have developed these type of apps and we think this project can enhance UX for sites with payment and subscription plans(user side). and facilitates developing(developer side).
 
 
Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
* Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  Workload of an employed person ([see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent)) (e.g. 2 FTE)
* **Total Costs:** Amount of Payment in BTC for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k at the time of submission. (e.g. 0.80 BTC)

### Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  1
* **Costs:** 0.75 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 70%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |
