# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project:** MediaBox
* **Proposer:** [cat4fire](https://github.com/cat4fire)
* **Payment Address:** 17PDx56MLASnEAVbHoQDsS5x3ysG5Mc1fX 

## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

MediaBox is a marketplace for content creators, musicians particularly, to sell content, usually in limited quantities, directly to fans. The scarcity of the content is guaranteed by blockchain technology. Since the supply of the content is hard capped to a limited copies, there is a second hand market where each of the copies can be resold to other fans at the price agreed between the buyer and seller in private. It protects the right of the music to be avoid downloading and sharing for free. 

In MediaBox, every music is copyright protected by UDAP’s Proxy Re-Encryption(PRE) modules. PRE schemes are cryptosystems which allow third parties to alter a cipher content which has been encrypted for one party, so that it may be decrypted by another. PRE ensures that nobody can download a music for free, and the shared music can’t be shared to any other parties. You can also share the bought music to your friend but you can’t listen the music during that time.

MediaBox allows musicians sell their own limited-edition music in the marketplace, users can buy and resell the music to other users too, allows the music to be priced right with the marketed value. Musician can enjoy the 20% of the resell price automatically. MediaBox starts from music first, and it can spread to other media types, like pictures, movies, and online novels, etc. 

We'll soon finished the alpha version on Ethereum and partnered with China Music Association which will provide us large amount of different music. We will bring millions of transactions on Polkadot, that’ll help Polkadot ecosystem grow fast.

The project includes the application on mobile phone, the blockchain side project which we will build on Polkadot, the desktop application on Windows for musician to upload and admin their music. Here are some screenshots:

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 
1.	Partnership with China Music Association

The parntership will offer us the songs, instruments, so we will have large amount of music when we do final launch. Even that version is different with the one we want to build on Polkadot(CMA uses a Ethereum cloned chain), we will use the same core system on Polkadot. 

2.	MediaBox workflow
