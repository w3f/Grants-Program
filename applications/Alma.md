## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

ALMA is a software and also a protocol with features as follows:
- It provides an identifier entity, which is uniquely assigned to a person, an organization, or objects, etc.
- It provides a function to recover keys and data while guaranteeing self-sovereign by using secret sharing.
- It provides a data entity called "instance", which has a selective disclosure function using zero knowledge proof.
- It provides a data format entity called "schema", which has a registration function and a sharing function to unify data formats.
- It provides a network entity called "region", where independency is guaranteed by defining and managing data, permissions, and users for each region.
- It provides an autonomous coupling function between regions. It combines loose and strong coupling, whether consortium or public, to address data loss and create trust.

### Project Details

I'll write more details in Lightpaper, but I'll give an overview of how

#### Technology Stack

Figure 1: Technology stack of ALMA.

Figure 1 shows the technology stack of ALMA and elemental technologies in each layer. The roles of each layer are described as follows:

* Layer 1: **Basic storage layer**. It manages data encryption and storing method, etc.
* Layer 2: **Peer-to-peer connection layer**. It manages communication between ALMA nodes.
* Layer 3: **Entity layer**. It manages the business logic of ALMA (e.g., authority management and inter-region coupling, etc.).
* Layer 4: **Application ecosystem layer**. It manages user interface such as web front or mobile apps.

These layers are implemented using the technologies in Figure 1.

#### Fundamental Entities

Figure 2: Relationship between entities (ID, schema and instance).

In ALMA, there are fundamental entities, i.e, identifier, schema, and instance. Data units called instances are passed between identities. The relationship between these entities are shown in Figure 2.

* **Identifier (ID)**: An identifier assigned uniquely in each region of ALMA. ID can be assigned to people, organization, and objects.
* **Schema**: A type definition of a set of data that is passed in a region of ALMA. IDs with schema definator role can define one.
* **Instance**: A data entity created by putting actual data into a schema. Instances are issued by a signer, owned by a holder, and verified by a verifier. Each of a signer, holder, and verifier has an ID.

#### Region

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/111d5ba6-bf29-482f-94d8-b712d83dea11)

ALMA's fundamental entities, such as IDs, schemata, instances, and nodes, are managed within a unit called "**region**". Each region has its own rule and governance. A region may be a centralized system, or a decentralized one. A region may allow anyone to register a new ID, or allow only specific people. In this respect, a region is comparable to a private network on the Internet.
A region is organized by multiple participant nodes. By using MPC, keys and data are distributed among the nodes in the region in a privacy-preserving manner. A node can select regions to join and contribute, and can belong to multiple regions.

### Ecosystem Fit
Although Alma network itself is not a blockchain but a decentralized system, it can be linked with Polkadot as storage and by linking assets. 
In addition, by storing various information associated with the wallet, it can contribute to making the system even more digitally meaningful.

## Future Plans

- Since all team members are working on this project as a side venture, we are able to keep engineering costs low. Our goal is to make this an open-source project, and we intend to seek funding through programs like this grant to support its development.

- We plan to develop the project in microservice units, enabling us to provide valuable libraries to the crypto industry. This modular approach will allow for easier integration and adoption within the broader ecosystem.

- Our long-term vision is to share this system with the world as an alternative to traditional blockchain and server infrastructures, offering a decentralized solution for a more sustainable future.Please refer to this section for more details:[Background](https://alma.gitbook.io/alma/alma-lightpaper/2.-background)
