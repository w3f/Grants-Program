### Technologies

#### 1) Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting, enabling the development of fast and scalable network applications. Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, which makes it lightweight and efficient, perfect for data-intensive real-time applications that run across distributed devices.

Within the context of the project, the following packages are used:
  - Axios: Axios is an npm package for making HTTP requests in Node.js, simplifying API calls.
  - pg: The "pg" package connects Node.js applications to PostgreSQL databases, enabling efficient data retrieval and manipulation.
  - Polkadot.js: Polkadot.js simplifies connecting and interacting with the Polkadot ecosystem
  - Squid SDK: Squid SDK is a set of tools and libraries to efficiently query the Archive data, transform, enrich and persist into the target store. Squid SDK projects are called squids.

#### 2) Bubble.io

Bubble.io is a visual development platform designed to democratize the process of creating web applications. It enables users, even without traditional coding skills, to build complex web applications through a user-friendly interface. Its features include visual programming capabilities, database management tools, a design editor, API integration, and hosting solutions. Essentially, Bubble.io is part of the no-code movement, which allows rapid digital product creation and innovation without requiring deep technical expertise.

#### 3) React.js

React.js, often simply called React, is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of an application efficiently. React operates on a virtual DOM, which optimizes rendering by minimizing direct manipulation of the actual DOM and by batching multiple changes together. This results in improved performance and a more seamless user experience. React's component-based architecture and its emphasis on declarative programming make it easier to understand, maintain, and scale applications.

### Components

#### 1) Data Source (Subsquid) 

The project aims to create a system to extract and process event data and metadata related to NFTs within the Polkadot ecosystem. The focus is on building flexible and modular data ingestion mechanisms to accommodate different APIs with minimal code changes, using Node.js components for reusability and scalability. 

To expedite development, the team will initially integrate with the Subsquid API, which is well-documented, robust and  opensource, and provides extensive data for selected protocols like Astar (ERC721, ERC1155, PSP34, PSP37), Basilisk (Uniques pallet), Efinity (ERC-721, ERC-1155), Moonbeam (ERC-721, ERC-1155), Unique Network (Native NFTs), Moonriver (ERC-721, ERC-1155) and Moonsama (ERC-721, ERC-1155). This initial integration will serve two main purposes: to quickly progress towards a working MVP and to serve as a practical example for future developers looking to extend the system with other data sources in the long term.

#### 2) Data Enrichment

Our backend serves as a vital nexus between supported blockchain protocols and valuable metrics we generate for user wallets and NFT collections. It involves three key activities: crafting and executing API queries, initiating timed triggers, and developing computational algorithms for metrics computation. We create and execute precise API queries to extract event data from Subsquid for protocols such as Astar (ERC721, ERC1155, PSP34, PSP37), Basilisk (Uniques pallet), Efinity (ERC-721, ERC-1155), Moonbeam (ERC-721, ERC-1155), Unique Network (Native NFTs), Moonriver (ERC-721, ERC-1155) and Moonsama (ERC-721, ERC-1155). This enables the continuous refresh of our system with recent blockchain events pertinent to the monitored NFT collections and user wallets. 

Our backend employs timed triggers to initiate queries to Subsquid at predefined intervals, ensuring we maintain an up-to-date snapshot of relevant blockchain events. Incoming event data, acquired via timed or event-driven triggers, is processed using specially designed computational algorithms. These algorithms generate key performance indicators (KPIs) and metrics for both user wallets and NFT collections, capturing the most essential insights. The calculated metrics are persistently stored in our database, ensuring their continuous availability for subsequent retrieval, analysis, and the provision of comprehensive insights into users' wallets and NFT collections.

All the code for data enrichment will be opensource so that more developers in the ecosystem can leverage our processes for retrieving NFT data from Subsquid API and wallets, as well as creating NFT metrics.

#### 3) Database 

We will be utilizing PostgreSQL as our database management system to store and manage all data. PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database management system that offers a broad range of powerful features. As our choice of infrastructure provider, we will be deploying PostgreSQL on Amazon Web Services (AWS).

#### 4) Frontend

We've chosen React.js for our frontend development, due to its open-source nature, and also with the intention of open-sourcing our own platform. This aligns with our commitment to enriching the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling more developers to leverage, adapt, and expand upon our work. React's component-driven approach ensures efficient and modular development, especially vital for our analytics platform. This decision guarantees adaptability for our MVP phase and scalability for expansive growth

#### 5) Bubble.io plug-ins

While our frontend for the Portfolio Tracker MVP will be developed using React.js, we recognize the importance of our broader platform's integration with Bubble.io. Hence, we will develop open-source plug-ins for Bubble.io, enabling connections to the selected wallets: Subwallet, Parity signer, Polkadot-js, Fearless wallet, Nova Wallet, and Talisman. These plug-ins, built using Node.js, will empower users to log in using their wallets and facilitate retrieving NFT ownership data for portfolio metrics computation. By open-sourcing these plug-ins, we aim to enhance the no-code community's access to the Polkadot ecosystem. Regarding the integration of React with Bubble.io plugins: While React itself doesn't natively support Bubble.io plugins, we can create a bridge using APIs or webhooks. 

### Ecosystem Fit

Upon delving deeper into the NFT portfolio tracking landscape within the Polkadot ecosystem, it's evident that while some platforms have incorporated NFT capabilities, they largely remain as extensions of their primary token and DeFi services. Our solution, on the other hand, is purpose-built for NFTs, offering a dedicated platform tailored for the nuanced requirements of NFT enthusiasts and investors.

As we look ahead, we're keen on forging strategic collaborations with NFT-centric parachains, such as Unique Network, and various NFT marketplaces. Such partnerships will not only amplify the Liisa portfolio tracker's functionality—through the integration of off-chain data—but also bolster their services by synergizing with our advanced analytical tools.

#### Similar projects:
- Nansen Portfolio
- De.Fi
- Coinstats

#### What makes us different is:
While platforms like Nansen and Coinstats have made significant strides in the broader crypto space, their focus is primarily on tokens, leaving Polkadot NFTs out of their purview. Meanwhile, the De.Fi platform's emphasis in this domain is still emerging. This observation underscores a distinctive opportunity in the Polkadot ecosystem: the need for a specialized NFT portfolio tracker, a niche we are poised to occupy.

In the absence of direct parallels, our differentiation can be better understood when juxtaposed with existing wallet services from a technical perspective.

Technical Differentiation:
1) Users receive an all-encompassing summary, highlighted by our unique Portfolio Scorecard, which evaluates liquidity, volatility, and NFT diversification.
2) Our platform goes beyond static visuals, offering dynamic filtering and sorting capabilities based on salient metrics such as sales and estimated value, resulting in a blend of technical robustness and user engagement.
3) Every NFT token is accompanied by a wealth of insights, ranging from its rarity rank within a collection to a meticulous activity log detailing all related transactions.
4) An aggregated perspective on NFT assets per collection is provided, supplemented with intuitive search features and dynamic filtering, presenting users with an innovative lens to evaluate collection performance.

In essence, our initiative pioneers novel metrics, visualization techniques, and deep dives into the NFT realm, setting a precedent in the Polkadot ecosystem.
