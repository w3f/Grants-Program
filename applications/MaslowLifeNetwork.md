# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Maslow Life Network
* **Team Name:** LifeNetwork
* **Payment Address:** 3HvWkYocTb9wgCQBEjYrTa7Ke8yCZYDAmX  (BTC Address)

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

Maslow Life Network is committed to building a blockchain social platform on Polkadot. It intends to expand to other areas of life based on this social platform, while creating a perfect social space and convenient application functions.

### Overview

We will build three social modules pallet, which includes the creation of basic user information/friendship/posts, and built on the Maslow Life Network, making the Maslow Network a social application para-chain of the Polkadot ecological community. Our team believes that the The establishment of a social ecology is very important, allowing users to better understand the blockchain ecology, and believe that this can make the application of the blockchain more popular.

### Project Details 

First of all, we will use the framework of Substrate to build the Maslow Life Network first to adapt to the data throughput of the social application module.

Then, we will make three pallets with personal information/friendship/posts, and combined with UI design and React to integrate and present a complete application.

We have planned a preliminary wireframe (https://956dkl.axshare.com), let us use this wireframe to make a rough explanation.

1. In terms of personal information, users can create their own characters in a virtual world for future communication in this virtual world, but we will treat it as a user on a social platform.

2. In the friends section, you can basically see the list of friends and detailed information, which can be roughly demonstrated and interacted in the wireframe.

3. The post function can be used for simple post/mood interaction in the minimum feasible application.

### Ecosystem Fit 

* Users can create a circle of friends in this application, and then share many interesting things about life on this circle of friends.
* Of course, if we build more applications in the future, users can also communicate with each other and share their experiences in the circle of friends.
