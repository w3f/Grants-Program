## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Overview

Maslow Life Network is a blockchain network based on Substrate technology. As a member of Polkadot, Maslow Life Network is a bridge network and mainly focuses on the direction of the Non-fungible tokens (NFT) asset exchange protocol. Cross-chain business. Through the Maslow Life Network, blockchain applications can facilitate the cross-chain interaction and transaction of Non-fungible tokens (NFT) assets through the Maslow Life Network.

### Overview

1. **Introduction:**

   The core technology of Maslow Life Network is the Polkadot-based Substrate development framework, which uses high-speed distributed sharding (EDS) technology to solve the balance between public chain performance and security, re-stacking the technical architecture, and developing various types of application software , Provide multiple efficient development tools and pluggable framework design to help developers realize one-stop application development and develop into a distributed infrastructure.

2. **Team Interest:**

   The world is being blockchainized and generalized. Tokens not only include homogeneous tokens (cryptocurrencies) that are widely used in the field of open financing, but also include more and more use in the art world and the game industry. In the process of using blockchain technology to create a new type of Non-fungible tokens (NFT) blockchain application, we found that there are still a few Infrastructure issues:

   1. Blockchain wallets cannot satisfy all kinds of tokens
   2. Blockchain exchange cannot satisfy all kinds of tokens
   3. Heterogeneity of public chains between different public chains
   4. Lack of a complete blockchain development platform

   Our team is committed to solving the problem of opening up

### Project Details 

1. **Glossary:**
   1. **LNT:** The original token assets of Maslow Life Network.
   2. **ULA:** Mining bonus.
   3. **Staking:** PoS mining process.
   4. **Slash algorithm:** The process and mechanism of punishment.
   5. **NPoS:** Reward verification mechanism for mining.
   6. **Verification:** The time for the NPoS mechanism to complete the process is an interval. Verifiers can hold entities within a range.
   7. **Nominated:** The time for the NPoS mechanism to complete the process is an interval. Nominees can participate.
2. **Token acquisition:**
   1. **LNT:** Staking energy is obtained by staking assets for PoS mining. If the user starts to retrieve the LNT pledged by staking, mining will stop, and it will take 14 days for the LNT to be released to be fully credited.
   2. **ULA:** In the staking process using LNT, users can choose to commit to locking LNT for a period of time to obtain ULA.
3. **Authentication:**
   1. The token rewards received by the account are determined by the reward distribution ratio, and the distribution ratio is presented by the staking calculation.
   2. Staking calculation can be similar to the calculation in PoW. The staking calculation of an account represents the contribution value of the account to staking at the current time. The calculation value of each account is derived from the LNT and ULA assets pledged in the account. It is decided that once the pledge is lifted, the corresponding calculation will also disappear.
   3. The staking calculation of an account is constantly changing with the amount of pledged assets, and cannot be transferred or transferred. Staking participants can modify the validator supported by voting, and change the validator supported by voting without unlocking the pledge.
   4. The ratio of the calculated value to the total value is called the calculated ratio:
      1. Computing power = total computing power × percentage of computing power
      2. The account's percentage of computing power = the percentage of computing power (LNT part) + the percentage of computing power (ULA part)
   5. Staking reward formula:
      1. Account Staking = (Total Revenue of Maslow Life Network × Y) × Proportion of Account Computing Power
      2. Account voting weight = total voting weight × account computing power percentage
4. **Economic model:**
   1. Original asset LNT is the original token asset of Maslow Life Network
   2. The total hard cap of LNT is 10 billion
   3. LNT can be used as fuel for transactions
   4. Fuel fees include transaction fees, contract execution fees, network bandwidth fees, and storage fees
   5. The supply of LNT when the main website of Maslow Life Network is launched is 1 billion. After that, the newly issued LNT will be distributed through the block rewards to the staking system and Treasury.
   6. After the main website of Maslow Life Network is launched, the block reward for that year is adjusted once a year, and the block reward for the Nth year is 1-(99 /100)^sqrt(N) of the remaining available supply.
   7. Total remaining issuable = total hard cap-current supply
   8. The supply in the next year = the supply in the previous year + the sum of the actual block rewards for the year
   9. According to the annual block reward and the block interval time (unit: second), the block reward for each block in this year can be calculated.
   10. Reward for each block = block reward for the year x block generation interval + total number of seconds per year (i.e. 365 times 24 times 3600)
### Ecosystem Fit 

1. **Decentralized wallet application:**
<br>Provide a Non-fungible tokens (NFT) module SDK to support Non-fungible tokens (NFT) decentralized wallet applications.<br/>

2. **Decentralized exchange application:**
<br>Provides a Non-fungible tokens (NFT) module SDK to support the application of Non-fungible tokens (NFT) in decentralized exchanges and become an independent trading market.<br/>

3. **Open social platform:**
   <br>Let’s take the unlocking of life achievements as an example to discuss the connection of the Maslow Life Network. Unlocking human generation is a blockchain game based on cross-chain and social state and the theory of human motivation. It is based on Ethereum, developed by TRON, and established. Public open social platform for users to communicate.<br/>

   The way to unlock life achievements and connect to the Maslow Life Network is as follows:
   1. As a heterogeneous other public chain, it will be connected to the Maslow Life Network through a bridge.
   2. The subsequent content will be developed based on the application chain SDK, which can be directly bridged with the Maslow Life Network chain.
   
4. **Concrete application:**   
   Openness As there are more and more Non-fungible tokens (NFT) assets, there are more and more demand for payments, transactions, and other derivative assets related to them, and actual needs, such as NFT's manual In the trading market, NFT mortgages and loans will all be more demanding.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that the scope of the work can fit within a three-month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month. 

For each milestone,

* make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
* include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
* commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone, and include the approximate number of days along with the cost per day.
* _Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory_ and shall not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**
