## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Aurras is a middleware that acts as an event processor and a low code workflow orchestration platform. Aurras is being pitched as a next-generation system for enabling decentralized push notification. This middleware solution listens to events from blockchain applications and propagates them to a registered pool of MQTT brokers. The broader architecture consist of parachain from which the middleware listens for the events.

Aurras as a part of Substrate / Kusama / Polkadot / Web 3 Ecosystem
* A core part of Decentralized Push Notification Architecture
* Can be used for business-critical and production-grade IoT devices to listen to events from blockchain
* Can be used with microservices across industry verticals
* Can be expanded to get integrated with data analytics, knowledge visualization, and machine and deep learning (ML/DL) algorithms
  

### Project Details

#### Architecture
![](https://storage.googleapis.com/hugobyte-2.appspot.com/Aurras%20Architecture.png)

#### Technologies
1. [Apache OpenWhisk](https://openwhisk.apache.org) is an open source, distributed Serverless platform that executes functions (fx) in response to events at any scale. OpenWhisk manages the infrastructure, servers and scaling using Docker containers. The OpenWhisk platform supports a programming model in which developers write functional logic (called Actions), in any supported programming language, that can be dynamically scheduled and run in response to associated events (via Triggers) from external sources (Feeds) or from HTTP requests
2. [Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org) is an open-source distributed event streaming platform. Kafka works well as a replacement for a more traditional message broker. Message brokers are used for a variety of reasons (to decouple processing from data producers, to buffer unprocessed messages, etc.). In comparison to most messaging systems, Kafka has better throughput, built-in partitioning, replication, and fault-tolerance which makes it a good solution for large scale message processing applications.
3. Docker 
4. Substrate
5. Rust  
6. Go

#### Components
1. **Event Sources (Substrate Event Feed)**  
This is the source for events from the blockchain and the events will be sent to the OpenWhisk system. The MVP event source will be implemented using [polkadot-js/api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api). For the actual implementation, we will be using a custom version of the substrate archive. Substrate archive will be indexing the blocks and an event actor will be decoding the events and data from the block and posting them to the OpenWhisk system. The indexer will use a NoSQL database to store the last indexed block and metadata. Using the substrate indexer as our event source will help us in solving many challenges ranging from fault tolerance to scalability to uniquely identifying multiple events with the same payload within a single block. The indexer will be connected to a substrate-based chain and RocksDB where the chain data is stored. When a new block is produced by the chain, the indexer collects the raw blocks from the RocksDB and sends it to the event actor. The event actor processes the block. The block data is decoded using the parity scale codec and mapped with the data types provided to the runtime. Once the event is decoded, the event actor posts a trigger to the event trigger manager.  

2. **Event Trigger Manager**  
Event trigger manager is composed of multiple actions including using a database to store trigger URLs and their respective auths, and Kafka provider, consumer and producer. Once the event manager receives an event from the event feed, this data is produced to a topic. The feed action in the trigger manager lets the user hook into the system. That is,  once an event is indexed to a particular topic, it can invoke a particular action. While creating the workflow, users can choose the event trigger as feed and provide necessary parameters from which chain it should be listening to and from which block it should start listening. Under the hood, a feed action is invoked with create lifecycle, which accepts the mandatory parameters the lifecycle, auth, trigger name, and other optional parameters of the event source. The feed action invokes the related actions of creating the entry in the database, adding to the Kafka consumer group, etc. The next component in the event trigger manager is a persistent connection to Kafka where it is used to produce and consume the stream of data. Once data is received in Kafka, the event trigger manager invokes the action to check the consumer groups for that particular topic and if found any, the trigger for the users under that particular group is invoked, which in turn invokes the workflow action.  

3. **Workflow Composer**  
Workflow composer consists of an async Rust library to compose multiple triggers, deployment configuration generator, and whisk deployment tool. For creating the workflow, the only input is the configuration file which is a YAML file. The workflow composition is laid out in the YAML which in turn takes care of the deployment and composing the triggers. Once a workflow is deployed to a namespace it creates a specific topic unique workflow id in Kafka. Workflow configuration comprises the input URL of workflow tasks, primarily GitHub repo, the sequence of processing tasks, and argument structure. Arguments must match the task input parameters.  

4. **Web API Gateway and Backend Service**   
This is the end user facing component to utilize the workflow. This component comprises of a backend application which is responsible for user registration, selecting the workflow, managing / creating workflow using friendly APIs, providing input parameters. API gateway / Machine gateway where the external world can connect to the Aurras system.  

### Ecosystem Fit
We have identified many great teams had to build their own implementation of event listeners/monitoring tools. We intend to make this aspect easier for the community to avoid most of the boilerplate so that they can just focus on workflow actions/tasks which are related to their project.
