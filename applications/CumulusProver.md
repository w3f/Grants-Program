## 2. Project Overview

The **Cumulus Prover** project aims to integrate a cryptographic proving system into Substrate parachains by extending the Cumulus node architecture. Our approach introduces out-of-the-box support for generating and verifying execution proofs in parachain consensus. This system is composed of two components:

* **Prover Node**: A modified cumulus node responsible for generating cryptographic proofs of block correctness during execution.
* **Verifier Module**: Integrated with para-validators, enabling them to cheaply verify the correctness of blocks. Since only 5 validators are assigned per `paraId`, this system ensures low overhead.

This architecture introduces a novel and lightweight form of block validation that maintains integrity without compromising performance. This project gives new parachains the ability to opt into a new approach to securing their parachain using a cryptographic proving system while maintaining economic security on Polkadot.

## 3. Project Details

We will modify the cumulus node and the `parachain-system` pallet to implement the proving and verifying logic.

### Technical Implementation

* **Node-Level Modifications (Cumulus)**:
  **Block Builder API**: Will include new cryptographic data fields into the block header structure. Specific changes include:

```rust
struct ExtendedHeader {
    proofs: Vec<Vec<u8>>,
    proof_root: [u8; 32],
    execution_cycles: u64,
    // ...existing fields
}
```

* **Block Execution API**

* Embed an SP1 RISC-V zkVM shell for executing parachain functions with specified inputs

* Update the block header after execution with the resulting proof data and performance metadata

* **Runtime-Level Modifications (pallet-parachain-system)**:

  * Modify the `fn validate_block` function to:

    * Verify the submitted proofs against the expected inputs and outputs
    * Check consistency of execution cycle counts and aggregated proof root

* **Prover Workload Distribution**:

  * After block execution in the zkVM, total cycle count is recorded
  * These cycles are split among connected and registered collator nodes
  * Each collator node processes a portion of cycles to generate partial proofs in parallel
  * Partial proofs are returned to an executioner node, which aggregates them
  * Aggregated proof is sent to para-validators for final verification

This process ensures:

* Minimal overhead on proof generation
* Efficient block production
* Collator parallelism that allows production of multiple blocks simultaneously without computational bottlenecks

    Exec->>Exec: Aggregate proofs

```

## 4. Ecosystem Fit

**Target Audience**: Substrate parachain developers, parachain node runners, and collator infrastructure providers.
**Value Proposition**: Enabling cryptographic block verification out of the box provides a layer of security and integrity for parachains, especially those operating under lightweight or adversarial conditions.

## Key Benefits:

1. Provides a path to alternative real-time cryptographic proving consensus.
2. Enables higher transaction throughput by distributing proof generation across multiple collator nodes in parallel.
3. Preserves and complements Polkadot's shared economic security model.
