## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
#### Background
The novelty and complexity of smart contracts, in addition to their role in managing potentially high-value digital assets, requires a high degree of attention to be paid to their security. Yet to date it is estimated that hundreds of millions of dollars have been lost to hackers who have exploited vulnerabilities in smart contracts.

Currently blockchain developers mainly check their smart contracts using manually written tests and source inspection by internal and external audit teams. However security auditing is a highly specialised skill (and may even be more so for Substrate chains which are based on relatively new software technologies such as Rust and WebAssembly). Further, the growing complexity of smart contracts and their composable nature makes it difficult to scale manual methods.

Klevoya’s mission is to build automated solutions that help blockchain developers find and eliminate bugs and zero-day vulnerabilities in their code before hackers can get to them.

**_Our solution:_** The [Substrate Contracts pallet](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet) will be used to execute smart contracts written by 3rd party developers, and these smart contracts may contain a variety of bugs. In this grant we will develop a WebAssembly smart contract byte-code fuzzer (i.e. dynamic execution of the smart contract in response to random inputs) for smart contracts that are to be deployed/executed in [Substrate’s Contracts pallet](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/smart-contracts/contracts-pallet). We will not be fuzzing the Contracts pallet itself, only the smart contacts that are to be deployed on it.

From experience with other blockchain ecosystems we have observed that the majority (if not all) of smart contract hacks that take place are a result of logic bugs. Therefore the main objective of this smart contract fuzzer will be to identify smart contract logic bugs. An ancilliary benefit will be to identify memory corruption errors in cases where developers use non-Rust programming languages (e.g. [Ask!](https://github.com/patractlabs/ask) which is based on AssemblyScript) to write their smart contracts.

This project builds on Klevoya’s previous work developing byte-code fuzzers for other WASM based smart contract chains.

**_Benefits of fuzzers:_**
1. In comparison to static analysis, fuzzers dynamically execute the code and therefore tend to give results that have fewer false positives/negatives than comparable static analysis techniques,
2. Bugs found by a fuzzer are easily reproducible as the inputs needed to recreate a bug are a by-product of the fuzzing process,
3. Fuzzing at the byte-code level means that we are agnostic to the smart contract programming language, whether that is ink! or some other future smart contract language, and,
4. In comparison to formal verification techniques, it is relatively easier to set up a fuzzing campaign as it does not require training and expertise in formal methods.


### Project Details

#### Prior work

We have already developed a generic, coverage guided WASM binary smart contract fuzzer. The diagram below shows the general architecture of the smart contract fuzzer (the section in the red dotted line denotes the scope of work for this grant application):

![fuzzer_arch2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8709186/119012917-60797800-b98e-11eb-9c50-ce7ab80c9a64.png)

The faster one can fuzz, then the more program paths that can be explored; therefore a key design feature of the fuzzer is its ability to execute many fuzz cases per seconds (we have benchmarked it executing several million fuzz cases/sec on a 16-core CPU with WASM binaries of a moderate size).

There are two main ways we achieve this high fuzz case throughput:
1. Efficient compilation of WASM bytecode to optimised machine code: WASM bytecode naturally doesn’t run on the processor. Modern compilers can generate high quality optimised code, but can take a long time to compile. However the compilation result can be cached, and reused between execution instances which leads to an ideal position of “compile once - run many”. To get optimised machine code we leverage existing tooling, namely Cranelift JIT to lift WASM bytecode to Cranelift IR, then transpile to C++ whilst adding instrumentation that allows gathering of coverage statistics. (This multi-stage process is necessary as existing WASM JIT compilers are fast to generate machine code, but the code they do generate is of poor quality - performance wise.) The transpiled C++ is then compiled to machine code with the Clang compiler.

![transpiler](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8709186/118856899-580e3800-b8cf-11eb-9a61-4927f9253bcc.png)

2. Parallel execution: the fuzzer runs several (typically one per CPU core) independent WASM Virtual Machine instances (the output of the compilation step detailed above) in parallel. Each VM instance has a local seed corpus, mutator and input generator (these parts are specific to a fuzz target and we will be developing a Polkadot specific one as part of this grant). The individual VMs then periodically sync their corpora to a corpus aggregator that allows the VMs to share corpus mutations.

#### Scope

In this grant we will only focus on fuzzing of WASM smart contracts. 

In the future we plan to expand the fuzzer to include fuzzing of custom (i.e. developed by third-party developers) Substrate Runtimes; we plan to seek a separate grant for that activity.

**_In scope:_**
- Implementation of a Substrate Smart contract model for integration with our generic WASM bytecode fuzzer. The model will be API compatible with the Contracts pallet with the underlying logic being mocked as much as possible (in order to reduce the maintenance of the model in response to future changes to the Contracts pallet)
- Development of scheme to detect simple logic bugs
- Finetune performance of fuzzing engine

**_Out of scope:_**
- No fuzzing of the Substrate Contracts pallet
- No Substrate Runtime fuzzing
- No fuzzing of non-WASM smart contracts (e.g. smart contracts that target the Substrate EVM Pallet)


### Ecosystem Fit

Making DApps built on Polkadot/Kusama robust to hacking is critical to ensuring the health of, and confidence in, the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem. To date we have not seen any tools that have been specifically developed to assess the security of Substrate smart contracts.

The results of this project will be used by smart contract developers to verify that their smart contracts are free of bugs and vulnerabilities prior to public deployment.

**_Similar work in this or other ecosystems_**

- A previous Web3 grant was awarded to a team to perform [WASM Runtime Fuzzing](https://github.com/w3f/Open-Grants-Program/pull/9). However in that grant they specifically sought to fuzz the wasmi/wasmtime to identify errors in those components, whereas in this grant we seek to fuzz smart contracts not the runtime.
- The greatest amount of similar work has been done in the Ethereum ecosystem where several blockchain security related organisations have developed fuzzers for Ethereum smart contracts. For example the [Echidna](https://github.com/crytic/echidna) fuzzer (by [TrailOfBits](https://www.trailofbits.com/)) and [MythX](https://mythx.io/) (by [Consensys](https://consensys.net/)) which is a security suite that includes a smart contract fuzzer. Those works are not applicable here as they fuzz smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) whereas we specifically target fuzzing of WASM smart contracts running on Substrate's Contract pallet.

In conclusion: we are not aware of any teams in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem that are currently pursuing a similar project.
