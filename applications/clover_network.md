If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.

### Overview

#### Introduction
  Clover is a Substrate-based Polkadot parachain which is committed to providing easy-to-use blockchain infrastructure by creating a one-stop comprehensive infrastructure that ultimately reduces the threshold and cost for the DeFi community.

Clover provides a perfect gateway to DeFi for everyone including those who are completely new to DeFi. We bridge the gap between the crowd and the DeFi world via a user-friendly front end portal with an easy-to-navigate multi-chain wallet, block explorer/DeFi application market for regular users and a user-friendly built-in protocol library that allows developers to easily deploy their own applications. Without the need of managing multiple assets in different accounts, Clover enables users to keep track of what’s happening real-time in one place. 

#### Integration
  
  We decided to develop on Polkadot mainly because of its enhanced scalability and low-in-cost among other smart contract platforms in the space. As a sharded multichain network, Polkadot allows the processing of many transactions on different chains in parallel that most legacy networks do not. While providing scaling solutions through parachains, Polkadot development is steadily advanced, has gathered a large number of developers from the community, and numerous projects are emerging endlessly in the ecosystem. On the other hand, Polkadot’s Substrate technology provides a relatively easy-to-use and highly customizable framework that allows us to build our platform to communicate with other ledgers, which in a sense will likely attract more users to onboard in the future. 

Clover will compete to join as parachain for Polkadot and is committed to becoming a digital finance portal and DeFi service provider on Polkadot. Focusing on both to-C and to-B users, Clover will provide a series of DeFi related products and services to meet the diverse needs of different users. At the same time, developing and providing a modular DeFi protocol, which greatly reduces the technology development threshold for upper-layer applications. Clover will put together a large user base and different projects into a one-stop open and integrated financial service platform on Polkadot, using Substrate framework, to communicate with other existing parachains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum parachains. Namely, Clover will be another parachain on Polkadot. Once the parachain gets the slot to join the Polkadot relay chain, they can communicate with each other through Cross-chain Message Passing (XCMP) protocol. That means Clover can build its DeFi with the other parachain assets, like the DeFi protocols on Ethereum.

#### Team Interest

  We are a team of like-minded people who have a dream of building a groundbreaking technology towards censorship resistance on utilizing newest additions to DLT technologies. Apart from incentivizing our core team with a structured/periodic compensation plan throughout the next 5 years with cliffs imposed in between, we give ourselves a high degree of autonomy and lots of space for creativity overall.

#### An overview of the technology stack
The bottom layer of Clover OS is built on blockchain. Application states are built on the Polkadot network, and the storage is built on IPFS. Leveraging on Polkadot’s parachain technology, Clover’s core advantage lies in its control panel. It can easily dock various user actions provided by its backend that has been integrated by a variety of tools including Wallet, Block Explorer, Polkadot-JS, and more. As a result, users can be connected, transact on various chains and integrate their corresponding functions with the support of Clover. Clover will collect incoming data and clean them, with our proprietary database and inhouse algorithm, data will undergo different sets of validation and analysis before they get applied and translated into visualizable data. Building on Substrate, Clover’s application terminal is determined to become the entrance to the global digital finance world with state-of-art simplicities. With accessible tools, better support, and lower cost, we are likely to see more applications to be developed on Polkadot in the future. Clover will foster a diversified and scalable DeFi environment that allows for more possibilities.

### Ecosystem Fit 
As a decentralized financial service provider on Polkadot, Clover provides modular DeFi protocols and application tools, which greatly reduces the repeated efforts needed in the protocol development. Modular DeFi protocols include Staking Liquidity Protocol, Decentralized Trading Protocol, Decentralized Lending Protocol, Token Dividend Protocol, Governance Protocol, and Synthetic Asset Protocols. Clover allows its upper-layer application projects to focus on improving user experiences and accelerate innovations of diversified financial applications through its composability. Clover can potentially convert a large number of DeFi users into users of its upper-layer applications. This way, upper-layer applications will be able to bootstrap its community and inject more market values. 

Clover will also establish a developer-centric community. In addition to giving rewards to those who provide constructive contributions, Clover will encourage its third party developers to continuously build innovative dApps on top of Clover. Each project built on Clover by the third party developers will require a solid financial foundation, and generally donations from the community are insufficient to cover development expenses which results in stagnated growth. Therefore a sound funding mechanism has been established, The Developer Incentive Program, where all the projects building on Clover can benefit from a share of transaction fees. The Developer Incentive Program (DIP) is a Clover-native consensus feature that aims to direct a percentage of transaction fees to registered smart contracts to incentivize in Clover third party contract developers and commons, mainly to boost external dApp development which ultimately enlarges the Clover DeFi ecosystem overall. The program is consistent with Clover’s properties of being a decentralized operating system which does not touch the inflation schedule or alter the scarcity of CLV, but effectively increases the security of smart contracts against bugs and software vulnerabilities by enabling external development to be properly funded. Overall the benefits of the plan create the potential for a very exciting future in which Clover can grow and compete, and can reach its goal of becoming the best possible DeFi platform for all. Therefore Clover, whose key role is to be the service provider of which will allow a variety of applications to be built on top, aims to become a one-stop financial services platform that highly incentives users, developers, and upper-layer applications to innovate. 

With the rapid development of DeFi, the demand for insurance protocols is also increasing and has become an important part of the DeFi protocols. At the current stage of DeFi development, it is not yet possible to directly trade assets such as stocks, precious metals, and commodities. However, the synthetic asset protocol will allow simulations of assets price and facilitate transactions on the blockchain. In addition, the developer community we established will also become a source of innovative DeFi protocols. Clover allows modularization of the different protocols, thereby providing a resourceful module library for upper-layer applications, which will ultimately enable the creation of more diversified financial applications. With the help of Bithumb Global bootstrapping the liquidity of Clover by co-sharing its marketing and community resources, we will be advising Clover on the go-to-market strategies and PR placements as well as launching campaigns, educating Bithumb users, and distributing to our network.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
* Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)

### Overview
