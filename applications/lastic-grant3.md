## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Building on the success of our first grant, we are now proposing a project to focus on indexing the Coretime Chain using Subsquid and implementing graphs for an insightful overview.
- Our goal is to build the foundations of a premier user experience by providing a comprehensive and interactive visualization of the Coretime Chain, Coretime data from the Relay Chain, and leveraging the power of graphs to offer a deeper understanding of data and trends. We will build this for Rococo in preparation for the launch of Agile Coretime on Kusama and Polkadot. 

### Project Details

For this grant, we will concentrate on the following key areas:

1. **Indexing the Coretime Chain with Subsquid**: We will utilize Subsquid to index the Coretime Chain. This will involve running the Substrate code locally and setting up the indexing framework. Our aim is to ensure that data from the Coretime Chain is accurately and efficiently indexed, providing a solid foundation for data analysis and visualization.

2. **Indexing Coretime-relevant actions of the Relay Chain with Subsquid**: We will utilize Subsquid to index the Coretime-relevant actions of the Relay Chain. This will involve running the Substrate code locally and setting up the indexing framework. Our aim is to ensure that coretime data from the Relay Chain is accurately and efficiently indexed, providing a solid foundation for data analysis and visualization. 

3. **Implementing Graphs for Visualization**: We plan to develop a series of interactive graphs that will offer users a comprehensive view of the Coretime Chain. These graphs will be designed to display various metrics and trends, providing users with valuable insights into the chain's performance and activities.

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Role in the Ecosystem**: Lastic seamlessly integrates within the Polkadot ecosystem, offering users an intuitive interface to assess the real-time status of coretime. This includes insights into available cores, owned cores, sales prospects for coretime, task allocations, newly created regions, regions within the instantaneous coretime pool, and transactions related to instantaneous coretime.
  
- **Target Audience**: Our primary user base encompasses:
  - Parachain teams looking for blockspace to expand or optimize their projects.
  - dApp developers aiming to ensure smooth and scalable operations.
  - Smart contract developers seeking efficient blockspace management.
  - Collators and validators striving for enhanced network optimization.
  - Coretime providers looking for a transparent space to offer their services.
  - Polkadot analysts and analytics providers in need of real-time coretime data.
  - MEV actors aiming to maximize their strategies.
  - DOT holders keen on understanding and optimizing their blockspace assets.
  
- **Addressing the Needs**: The Lastic UI is meticulously designed to cater to users desiring a simplified yet comprehensive overview of the coretime landscape on Polkadot. In the broader vision, along with providing a better user experience for those looking to buy Bulk and Instantanious Coretime, Lastic plans to pioneer a robust secondary marketplace for Polkadot's blockspace. This platform will facilitate the buying and selling of blockspace, supporting projects that need expansion or those that have excess blockspace to offer.

- **Comparison to Existing Solutions**: When evaluating the existing landscape within the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, we found no projects that are currently in development with Lastic's vision or offerings, making our initiative unique and essential.

### Team's experience

#### **Phil Lucsok**: 
Phil began his career in web3 as a marketing and communications manager for a Bitcoin startup in Berlin in 2013 called [BitcoinsBerlin](https://web.archive.org/web/20220707055043/https://bitcoinsberlin.com/). There, he created marketing campaigns for multiple products including:
- [All4BTC](https://all4btc.com/) - a one-stop shop for purchasing anything on Amazon or eBay with bitcoin
- Bills4BTC (later [Bitwala](https://bitwala.com/), Nuri) - a SEPA-compliant payment method for holders of Bitcoin for regular payments
- e4BTC - an electronics shop supporting purchases in Bitcoin

After this, he worked for 3.5 years at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), a web2 social media platform for scientific researchers, where he learned skills in Product Management, Product Analytics, UX development and copywriting and design, and industry-standard growth practices.

In late 2017, Phil joined Parity Technologies to lead technical communications on Ethereum and Polkadot. There he worked closely with developers to create promotional content for open-source products including Parity Ethereum, Parity Signer, Polkadot.js. It was between 2018 and 2020 where he represented Parity in Ethereum governance to help recover the stuck funds from the November 2017 multisig hack. 

He led the communications team for the first two years, growing the team from 1 to 12, where they created and executed the launch strategies for Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate. After that he joined the Ecosystem Success team to work with parachain teams to improve their communications and act as a liason between Substrate Builders Program teams and Parity.

Phil currently works as a freelancer but is focused on leading [Missing Link](https://www.missing-link.io/)'s marketing, communications and governance strategies. He is also an active participant in Polkadot governance discussions on the Kusamarian and in ChaosDAO.

*Note: Phil Lucsok has previously applied at the Web3 Foundation and has successfully completed Lastic Grant 1. and 2. *

#### **Aurora Poppyseed**:
Aurora's journey in the technological sphere stands out for her innovative approach and unwavering determination. With a foundation in Physics and Electrical Engineering, she transitioned into roles as varied as a Solutions Architect, focusing on electronics and low-level programming, to a Frontend Developer with a commitment to clean code and scalable frontend architectures. 

At [**Instrumentation Technologies**](https://www.i-tech.si/) in Nova Gorica, Slovenia, she led the design of intuitive GUIs for advanced measurement devices in particle accelerators and streamlined future development with a standardized Vue CLI-based web GUI framework. Her contribution as a Frontend Developer at [**Block Analitica**](https://blockanalitica.com/) involved engineering the frontend framework for the [**Ajna project**](https://www.ajna.finance/) initiated by the **MakerDAO team**, ensuring clean coding practices and an organized project structure for future open-source contributions.

Aurora attended and graduated from the [**Polkadot Blockchain Academy**](https://www.polkadot.network/development/academy/) at UC Berkeley (engineering track), learning about the fundamentals of blockchain from leaders in this domain. Further enhancing her mark in the blockchain domain, Aurora offered her expertise to [**KodaDot**](https://kodadot.xyz/), a prominent multi-chain NFT marketplace, developing developer documentation and crafting both technical and non-technical articles to amplify the platform's presence.

In the realm of community engagement and organization, Aurora co-organized the [**Polkadot Bled mini-conference**](https://www.meetup.com/subwork/events/292274713) and more recently, orchestrated a breakfast as a side event at sub0 aimed at [**women in Polkadot** in collaboration with **H.E.R. Dao**](https://lu.ma/dzuqx5nw). This gathering aimed to empower and bring together women leaders and enthusiasts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Furthermore, she's a staunch supporter of [**SubWork**](https://subwork.xyz/), a tech-centric coworking hub in the scenic Bled region and one of the pioneer **Polkadot hubs**.

Now a freelance blockchain developer, Aurora champions women's representation in Polkadot and ardently supports community-driven blockchain initiatives.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**Previous Grant Completion:**
- We successfully delivered on Grant Application Number 1, focusing on creating a UI mockup for the Coretime Parachain and developing a static mockup with simulated data. And on Grant Application Number 2 - coretime price simulator, creating a simulator based of the pricing of Coretime based on the `broker pallet` code.

**Future Plans:**
- Post-completion of this grant, we aim to further enhance Lastic's capabilities by exploring more advanced features and integrations, ultimately contributing to a more robust and user-friendly Polkadot ecosystem.
