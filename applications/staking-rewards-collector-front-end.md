## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is in response to [Front-End for Staking Rewards Collector](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/staking-rewards-collector-front-end.md)


### Overview

This is a Staking Rewards Viewer for Polkadot and Kusama allowing users to view their staking rewards and easily download their search results.
This implementation will take the work started in the [staking-rewards-collector](https://github.com/w3f/staking-rewards-collector) and integrate it with an easy to use modern front end using Next.js and deployed on Vercel with the goal of deploying to IPFS.

I am interested in utilizing my current Software engineering skills to contribute to the Polkadot ecosystem. I have been following the project for a few years and have been looking for a way to participate.

[Propsoal Repo](https://github.com/jackson-harris-iii/staking-rewards-viewer) with a screenshot of mockup created in Adobe Xd. Here is a quick demo video of a work in progress [Video](https://www.loom.com/share/435c92cb3abe4984b18716642d01f631) and a [Deployed](https://staking-rewards-viewer.vercel.app/) demo on vercel. (currently, the vercel version is not making requests. Looking at swapping out the curlRequest for fetch API calls.

### Project Details

#### MockUp
![](https://github.com/jackson-harris-iii/staking-rewards-viewer/blob/main/mockup.png)

#### Technologies
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

* Mockups/designs Adobe Xd
* Front End: Next.js, Material Design Bootstrap React
* Back End: N/A (The applicatoin will use a serverless design on Vercel/Fleek)


### Ecosystem Fit

The [staking-rewards-collector](https://github.com/w3f/staking-rewards-collector) is a tool to gather staking rewards for given addresses and cross-reference those with daily price data. This is a very useful tool for every validator and nominator in the ecosystem. However, since it has currently a CLI and requires some technical knowledge to set up (git, nodejs, yarn). A front-end hosted on a website could help many users getting access to this tool and enjoy the benefits.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

* Original [RFP](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/rfps/staking-rewards-collector-front-end.md) (requests for proposal),
* Conversation reference to my original [submission](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/pull/439) with @axl of w3f


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Milestone 1 (Implementation & Testing)

* **Estimated Duration:** 12 days
* **FTE:**  12
* **Costs:** 4000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | UI for user input | Develop an UI to request necessary data from the users. |
| 2a. | Address LookUp Functionality | Allow users to enter multiple wallet addresses for either or both the Polkdaot and/or Kusama networks and deploy these features to Vercel. |
| 2b. | CSV/JSON Download | Enable users to download a copy of their lookup results in either CSV or JSON format. |
| 3. | Form validation | Add form validation to wallet address input while still allowing for multiple addresses to be entered. Validation for fiat amounts that will properly display based on the selected currency. |
| 4.  | UI for data visualizer  | Develop an environment to display the output (.csv and .json) for the end user in a pleasurable way. |
| 5. | Tooltips/Helpers | Implement help texts and tooltips to explain the different features and inputs to users. |
| 6. | Testing | Write tests to confirm the application behaves as expected |
| 7. | Polishing & Delivery | Reach out for feedback to the Grants Team. Integrate final feedback on functional, as well as cosmetic changes like font size, colors, typos etc. | 

## Future Plans

* Collaborate with the original RFP proposer to determine how to best promote the finished application throughout the community.
* Ask the community for suggestions to improve and add new features as necesary.
* Refactor and Deploy to IPFS
