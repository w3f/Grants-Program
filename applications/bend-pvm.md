# Bend-PVM: A Next-Generation Smart Contract Language for PolkaVM

## Project Overview

Bend-PVM is a new smart contract programming language specifically optimized for PolkaVM. It combines the familiarity of Solidity with the power and safety of functional programming paradigms to create a secure, efficient, and developer-friendly language for the Polkadot ecosystem.

Our language provides a compelling migration path for Ethereum developers while leveraging the advanced capabilities of PolkaVM's RISC-V architecture and Polkadot's sophisticated resource model.

### Project Details

The smart contract development space faces several critical challenges:
- High gas costs limiting complex application development
- Security vulnerabilities costing billions in exploits
- Difficult tradeoffs between security and usability
- Steep learning curves for new blockchain developers

Bend-PVM addresses these challenges by:
- Implementing a multi-dimensional resource model aligned with Substrate's weight system
- Incorporating functional programming features that enhance security
- Maintaining high compatibility with Solidity for easy developer migration
- Optimizing specifically for the PolkaVM runtime environment

### Ecosystem Fit

Bend-PVM fits perfectly within the Polkadot ecosystem:

1. **Problem solved**: Provides a secure and efficient smart contract language specifically designed for PolkaVM, bridging the gap between Ethereum developers and Polkadot's architecture.

2. **Target audience**: 
   - Ethereum developers looking to migrate to Polkadot
   - New blockchain developers seeking a secure yet approachable language
   - Polkadot parachain teams needing efficient smart contract capabilities

3. **Similar projects**:
   - ink! - Rust-based smart contracts for Substrate
   - Solang - Solidity compiler for Substrate
   
   Bend-PVM differentiates by:
   - Offering better Solidity compatibility than ink!
   - Providing stronger functional programming features than Solang
   - Being specifically optimized for PolkaVM's RISC-V architecture
