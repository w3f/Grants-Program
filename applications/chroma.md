# Chroma

## Project Overview

**Tagline:** End-to-end testing library for Polkadot wallet integrations

**Project Description:** 
Chroma is an end-to-end (E2E) testing library specifically designed for Polkadot wallet interactions. It enables developers to write automated tests that interact with real wallet extensions, providing a comprehensive testing solution for decentralized applications (dApps) in the Polkadot ecosystem.

**Polkadot Integration:**
Chroma integrates directly with the Polkadot ecosystem by supporting popular wallet extensions like Polkadot.js Extension and Talisman Wallet. It enables testing of wallet connections, account imports, transaction approvals, and authorization flows that are essential for Polkadot dApps. The library is particularly valuable now that PVM (Polkadot Virtual Machine) is live on Kusama, supporting smart contract development.

**Team Interest:**
We identified a significant gap in the Polkadot testing ecosystem - there was no comprehensive E2E testing library that could directly connect with real wallet extensions. This makes it difficult for developers to properly test their dApps' wallet integration, leading to potential bugs and poor user experiences in production.

### Project Details

**Technology Stack:**
- **Playwright**: Primary E2E testing framework providing browser automation capabilities
- **Polkadot.js Extension**: First wallet extension to be supported for Polkadot ecosystem testing
- **Talisman Wallet**: Multi-chain wallet extension support for both Polkadot and Ethereum testing

**Core Architecture:**
The library provides a set of fixtures and utilities that extend Playwright's testing capabilities specifically for wallet interactions. The core components include:

- **Extension Management**: Automated download and setup of wallet extensions
- **Account Management**: Import accounts using seed phrases or private keys
- **Authorization Flows**: Handle wallet permission requests and approvals
- **Transaction Testing**: Approve and reject transaction flows
- **Multi-chain Support**: Support for both Polkadot and Ethereum chains through Talisman

**API Specification:**
```typescript
import { expect, test } from '@avalix/chroma'

test('sign transaction', async ({ page, importAccount, authorize, approveTx, rejectTx }) => {
    // Import web3 account
    await importAccount({
        seed: MNEMONIC_HERE,
        name: 'Account 1'
    })

    // Authorize wallet permission
    await authorize()

    // Approve on-chain transaction
    await approveTx()

    // Reject on-chain transaction
    await rejectTx()
})
```

**Proof of Concept:**
A working proof of concept has been developed and demonstrated, showcasing the core functionality: https://x.com/0xPresc/status/1963458250869018864

**What Chroma is NOT:**
- Not a replacement for unit testing - it focuses specifically on E2E wallet integration testing
- Not a wallet extension itself - it works with existing wallet extensions
- Not limited to headless testing - requires browser UI for reliable wallet interactions
- Currently limited to Chromium-based browsers due to Playwright extension support limitations

### Ecosystem Fit

**Ecosystem Position:**
Chroma fits into the Polkadot developer tooling landscape as a specialized testing infrastructure component. It bridges the gap between dApp development and wallet integration testing, providing developers with the tools needed to ensure their applications work seamlessly with popular Polkadot wallets.

**Target Audience:**
- **Primary**: dApp developers building on Polkadot/Kusama who need to test wallet integrations
- **Secondary**: QA engineers and DevOps teams implementing CI/CD pipelines for Polkadot projects
- **Tertiary**: Wallet developers who want to test their extensions against various dApps

**Needs Addressed:**
- **Automated Wallet Testing**: Currently, developers must manually test wallet integrations, which is time-consuming and error-prone
- **CI/CD Integration**: Enables automated testing of wallet flows in continuous integration pipelines
- **Multi-chain Testing**: Supports testing across different chains supported by wallets like Talisman
- **Real Extension Testing**: Tests against actual wallet extensions rather than mocked implementations

**Need Identification:**
The need was identified through direct experience in dApp development where manual wallet testing proved to be time-consuming and error-prone. The proof of concept demonstrates the technical feasibility of the approach (https://x.com/0xPresc/status/1963458250869018864).

**Similar Projects in Polkadot Ecosystem:**
Currently, there is no comprehensive E2E testing library specifically designed for Polkadot wallet integrations. After thorough research of the Polkadot Forum, Tech Stack documentation, and OpenGov proposals, no similar project was found addressing this specific need.

**Similar Projects in Related Ecosystems:**
The closest comparable project is [@chainsafe/cypress-polkadot-wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chainsafe/cypress-polkadot-wallet), which provides Cypress-based testing for Polkadot wallets. However, Chroma differs significantly:

- **Framework Choice**: Uses Playwright instead of Cypress, offering better extension support and performance
- **Implementation Approach**: Does not modify wallet internals like `signerPayload`, maintaining compatibility with real wallet behavior
- **Multi-chain Support**: Native support for both Polkadot and Ethereum chains through Talisman integration
- **Real Extension Testing**: Works with actual wallet extensions rather than modified implementations

This approach makes Chroma particularly suitable for the current ecosystem where PVM is live on Kusama, enabling comprehensive testing for smart contract dApps.

## Development Status

**Current Status:** Chroma is currently in active development with a working proof of concept that demonstrates the core functionality.

**Proof of Concept:**
A functional proof of concept has been developed and publicly demonstrated, showing the library's ability to interact with real wallet extensions for automated testing. The demonstration can be viewed at: https://x.com/0xPresc/status/1963458250869018864

**Development Progress:**
- ✅ Core architecture designed and implemented
- ✅ Basic Playwright integration with wallet extensions
- ✅ Account import functionality working
- ✅ Transaction approval/rejection flows functional
- 🔄 Preparing for initial open-source release (version 0.0.x)
- 🔄 Integration testing with Create Dot App project

**Testing and Validation:**
The library is being tested against the Create Dot App repository (https://github.com/preschian/create-dot-app) to ensure real-world applicability and identify potential issues before the official release.

**Known Limitations:**
- **Browser Support**: Currently limited to Chromium-based browsers due to Playwright's extension support constraints
- **Headless Mode**: May require non-headless mode to avoid flaky tests and ensure reliable wallet interactions
- **Extension Dependency**: Relies on open-source wallet extensions for implementation
