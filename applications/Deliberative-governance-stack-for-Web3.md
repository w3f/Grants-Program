## Overview

### Tag line

Designing, testing, and scaling deliberative governance to improve Web3 governance

### Brief description

As Humanity dives into a new paradigm, there is a profound need to reassess the way we take collective decisions. Activists, academics, and practitioners worldwide have been planting seeds of new ways of doing things. We think 3 emergent practices and approaches are particularly interesting to explore: Deliberative Governance, Blockchain technology, and the regenerative mindset.

The project aims at researching, testing, and scaling if and how these 3 approaches can be combined to unlock the next generation of governance for the 21st Century by leveraging the Dotsama ecosystem and Technology.

### Relation to Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama

The project relates to Polkadot and Kusama because it's the most advanced system in terms of governance at scale. It also is the only large ecosystem with an evolutive governance framework that allows to test and deploy new ways of governance. Plus the Canari network principle makes it possible to battle test new approaches.

### Interest of the team

Our team is passionate about governance AND crypto. Our work aims at impacting how Human take collective decisions in a way that is inclusive, of high epistemic quality, transparent and reflexive. We are deeply engaged in both worlds and think that better governance for Web3 is the next frontier. 

## Project Details - Concept

As blockchain technology and crypto-related ecosystems grow, they are demonstrating the potential they have to change the world. If we look at governance, DAOs and chains have a powerful potential in terms of immutability, transparency, scalability, and incentive structures. 

At the same time, the challenges they face are also becoming clear.

Particularly, decentralized governance has reached a clear bottleneck: crypto governance is plagued by low participation and turnout, bad quality forum discussions, nepotism, collusion, influencer biases, etc. This – in itself – is not dramatic as DAOs and chain governance are very new institutions and there needs to be a lot of piloting and experimentation to find the right balance between old and new institutional designs, between soft and hard governance, and between social and onchain consensus.
The recent dramatic events around Terra-Luna, the Solend governance proposal, the Juno chain proposal 16, and Cefi “non-governance” have shown that the stakes are high and affect the lives of tens of thousands of people.  

Deliberative Governance has been invented, piloted, and scaled since roughly 30 years as an answer and complement to the shortcomings of classical representative democracy and direct democracy. It brings collective intelligence (vs collected intelligence from voting, opinion polls, or current crypto governance) to fruition, is epistemically strong (through cognitive diversity and the methods used in the process) and highly legitimate (through random selection of participants also known as Aleatorian Democracy). An overview of the many faces of deliberation can be explored at (https://participedia.net/).

These 2 approaches have a clear potential to test and scale a new way of taking collective decisions as long as we approach them in the more general framework of the regenerative approach, meaning if we integrate them in a systemic view of life.

The project we propose aims at researching, piloting, and scaling a potential way to dramatically improve the governance of Polkadot and on Polkadot by enriching it with Deliberative governance practices and by putting them in a regenerative framework. We may start experimentation on Kusama or Parachains of the Kusama ecosystem.

Governance 2.0 of Polkadot brings a lot of improvements but will still obfuscate part of the social and human consensus process necessary to prepare, support, and legitimize the onchain consensus. Referenda are great tools for aggregation of preferences and governance 2.0 seems to bring the process to another level. But referenda are bad at allowing preferences to emerge and mature. Referenda are collected intelligence not collective intelligence. A pure technological and aggregative approach to governance ensures that it will fail as representative democracies have shown. Human beings are biologically programmed to discuss with another and deliberate (buzzword homo puppy).

Therefore it is critical to prepare governance 3.0 and work on the right combination of deliberation and aggregation, collective and collected intelligence.

To take an example in the frame of governance 2.0, we could imagine to “oraclise the user information” in parallel to the expert information. This would bring legitimacy and transparency to the process as well as a cognitive strength. Also in the phase of proposing, it would be very useful to have a deliberative brick to the process.

## Mockups/designs of any UI components

Deliberative governance outside the Web3 space has been deployed thousands of times.
For recent examples of processes run by the team, see: www.wetheinternet.org / https://futureu.europa.eu/?locale=en /

## Data models / API specifications of the core functionality

Not relevant

## An overview of the technology stack to be used

The stack will be process-oriented and not software-oriented at the beginning. When the time comes to translate deliberative governance into onchain tools we will decide upon the best way to do this.

## Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

Documentation will be done online in a public repository

## PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

PoC / MVP will be developed in the course of phase 1 of the project. Nevertheless, we have run a first pilot with a constitutional process of the DEGENDAO by using deliberative methods to create and launch the investment DAO which has a total portfolio of USD M50+ in custody.  

## What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
 
The project is exploring a new frontier. We know that deliberation works and has transformative value for 95% of people experiencing it. We know that deliberation creates better decisions and research and practice in the field are solid. We know that Web3 governance is full of potential. We don't know how much effort it will take to merge them. We don't know if in the end, it will be possible to create an independent software suite for onchain deliberation or if it will still need a process of soft support to make it happen.

# Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

## Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

It fits at the level of governance of the ecosystem and each of its projects. Governance is the enabler for efficient, inclusive projects and a solid chain. So it can be anchored at Chain level (KSM or DOT), parachain level, or project level. 

## Target audience 

The target audience is all stakeholders who will benefit from stronger governance: Users, developers, Parachains

## What need(s) does your project meet

The need for a better, more inclusive, more legitimate, more epistemic, more deliberative governance.

## Similar projects 

NO

This is a completely new frontier. So there also are no similar projects on other chains.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview
- **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 months for milestones 1 and 6 months for milestones 2 / 1 year for milestones 3 and 4 and one year for milestones 5 
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  1,5 FTE for milestones 1 and 2 / 2 FTE for milesteones 3 and 4 and 2 FTE for milestone 5
- **Total Costs:** The full process of all Milestones demands extended funding. But we do not seek complete funding now. Each milestone can be funded in a consequent order, or partially in combination with other grant-making programs. **The current grant application aims at funding Milestone 1** and if successful milestone 2 which will allow unlocking Milestones 3 to 5. Funding for milestones 3 to 5 is difficult to estimate at this stage. Milestone 1: $25.000

### Milestone 1 - Research paper and Proof of concept (THIS IS THE DEMAND FOR FUNDING)

- **Estimated duration:** 6 months
- **FTE:**  4 months of a mixed team of junior and senior
- **Costs:** 27,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Creative Commons CC-BY |
| 0b. | Documentation | In this milestone the goal is to publish a proof of concept of the approach, a peer-reviewed article summarising the theoretical framework of the approach, and to produce a detailed roadmap for Milestone 2. We will document the process by the way of a notion site opened to the public. |
| 0c. | Testing protocol | We will test the approach with key actors of the Web3 / Crypto governance ecosystem in the Dotsama ecosystem and outside (we particularly think about Aave, Paladin, Element.fi, and SNX, who all have interesting governance structures). |
| 0d. | Article | At the end of Milestone 1 we will have a paper submitted for peer-review or already published. This will be done in collaboration with the DeSci initiative of the Samrt Contract Research Forum (https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/). We will be in the second batch of their pilot on decentralized peer review from September. This should allow for a peer-reviewed publication by end of year. Also we have been exploring the path to a publication in the https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/blockchain journal with their team. The paper will consist of the state of the art of deliberative and crypto governance, a gap analysis, a research and action agenda. The research will be embedded in the work of the Metagov group (https://metagov.org/) and could be run in collaboration with the Mc Court Institute as both are high-quality networks of researchers on the question. | 
| 0e. | Design for Prototype process | In parallel to the paper we will produce a document detailling a prototype for experimentation with a real-life DAO or Chain/Parachain. This document will present a list of activities and calender for the experimentation, the topic and subject at sake, the target group, the number of participants, the methods used, the outputs of the experimentation, etc. It is difficult to foresse now what exactly it will entail as we first need to find the relevant partner/chain to deploy it. | 


## Future Plans

If milestones 1 is successful, we plan following milestones 2 to 5: 

### Milestone 2 — Experimentation

- **Estimated Duration:** 6 months
- **FTE:**  13 Months of a mixed team of senior and junior
- **Costs:** 58,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Creative Commons CC-BY |
| 0b. | Documentation | In this milestone we will test the approach in the frame of a real-life DAO or chain. We will test all steps of interaction between deliberative and crypto governance in a regenerative framework. We aim at the first test with a para chain of the Dotsama ecosystem. We will document the process by the way of a notion site opened to the public. |
| 0c. | Testing protocol | The testing will be the core of the work in this milestone and the protocol will be based on the results of milestone 1. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will not provide a docker file as Milestone 2 is a test with people and not software |
| 0e. | Article | At the end of Milestone 2 we will publish a second peer-reviewed paper consisting of the results of the experimentation, an update on the theoretical and practical approach, and a roadmap for milestones 3 to 5. | 


Milestone 3: Dissemination and impact. After experimentation, we will capitalize on lessons learned and take time to engage with the Dotsama communities and stakeholders to disseminate the approach and improve the process. It will aim at embarking new DAOs and chains. We will start product design for a suite of onchain tools to guide the deliberative bricks of the process. For example, we could design a “constitution builder” based on a deliberative process aimed at new parachains. We could also propose a referendum to start implementing deliberative elements into the governance of Kusama and Polkadot.  

Milestone 4: Scaling: In this phase, we will scale the approach to 10 and then 50 chains and/or DAOs. It will allow us to learn lessons on scaling, avoid pitfalls, improve the models, and gain visibility. It will also allow testing of the software suite of tools for deliberative crypto governance.

Milestone 5: Sustainability and Exit to community. If the approach proves to be working and giving good results, we will design, improve and test a business model aiming at supporting DAOs in their pivot to hybrid governance. We will finalize the software bricks needed to support those processes. This will allow sustainable support to DAOs and a new business. Down the road, and if the model is successful, we will exit to the community to give back and decentralize the approach.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** 

The team leader talked with Gavin Wood at Dappcon 19 and with the team of the Moonriver foundation in March 2022 who recommended us to apply at the level of the Web3 foundation at it seemed to be more relevant at this level.
