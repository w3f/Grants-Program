Project Overview

Overview

Tagline
A public verification layer for digital asset projects built on open standards.

Global Token Registry is a verification system that allows crypto projects to submit identity information, governance information and evidence of activity in a structured and reliable format. It provides an attestation process, a trust indicator system and a public verification service.

The project connects with the Polkadot ecosystem through state anchoring, proof generation and Substrate compatible formats. This allows wallets, explorers and parachain tools to confirm the integrity of project information and verify that it has not been altered.

The team is building this work because no consistent and open standard exists for project level verification. Polkadot is a suitable environment due to its modular design, predictable verification and secure shared base.

Ecosystem Fit

Global Token Registry will offer a shared and consistent layer of verification for the Polkadot ecosystem. It will support any team that needs reliable information about the identity and governance of a project.

Target groups

Wallet developers
Parachain developers
Explorer and indexer teams
Security and audit teams
Project teams
Regulatory aligned services

Needs addressed

There is market wide uncertainty regarding the accuracy of project information. Many incidents of fraud and failure occurred because information presented to users was not verified. Research by Chainalysis recorded significant losses linked to misleading information. European regulators have highlighted the need for better transparency in digital asset activity. Developer discussions also show clear demand for an open verification standard.

There are no existing systems in the Polkadot ecosystem that provide structured project verification or evidence based trust indicators. Identity tools exist but they do not supply registry verification. Outside ecosystems offer code reviews and audits but no neutral project registry with verifiable state.

Team

Team Members
Kuljit Toor
Engineering support will be contracted for Rust development, backend work and verification logic as required.

Team Capacity
The project will be delivered through a combined capacity equal to two full time roles plus an additional half time engineering support role. This totals 2.5 FTE. This covers attestation development, registry building, anchoring integration, proof generation and documentation. Additional specialist support will be used when required for code review, testing and integration.

Future Plans

The registry will be extended into deeper governance models if further funding is secured. A federated hosting model will be created through a separate program when available. Multi chain integrations will be considered after the core system is live. The long term aim is to support a wider trust infrastructure based on open standards.

Additional Information

The team learned about the program through Web3 Foundation communication and research. Previous applications include NGI Zero, NGI Fediversity and ARIA. None overlap with the work funded in this proposal.
