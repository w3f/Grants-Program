## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

**Brief description of the project**

Reinvigorate the Master-Apprentice Model. Thunderous Protocol is the blockchain network implementing the industry-driven education protocol. Thunder.University will be the DApp using Thunderous protocol.

Tokenization with customized blockchain rules will push learning, teaching, mentoring and innovating experience to a new level. 


**An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.**

* Create our own blockchain network with Substrate technologies.
* Develop the pallets/runtime modules for the education protocol.
* Interested to launch on Kusama, then conduct IPO to get a slot on Polkadot.

**An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.**

* :point_right: Launched the Substrate Runtime Developer Program. We worked together with Parity Technologies and Acala Network. :100:We'd love to use this protocol to run the program one day. More http://ic.guru/substrate
* :point_right: Using industry-driven & apprentice-master approach at Industry Connect - a global tech education under our group.
* :point_right: Operating a successful education Saas software which gives us the rich knowledge in education management. More info http://aimy.io
* :point_right: Piloted the concept of the protocol with tokenization in a centralized solution, we've received amazing result. More info http://io.ic.guru/


### Project Details 

The whole project consists of two main components. This application focuses on the blockchain/protocol part.

* The blockchain and protocol, it is called Thunderous Network.
* The DApp implementing the protocol, it is called Thunder University.

Here are some creatives illustrating how the protocol will work

**Overview of Use Cases**

**Here are some typical use cases**
* Learn & Earn Back Model
  * A learner pays the full course fee, and will get half of that refunded after meeting certain criteria during the learning journey e.g. attendance is met.
* Sponsored Learning Model
  * A learner deposits the full course fee, the employer also deposits the full course fee for the learner. When the learner meets certain criteria set by employers, employer's charged, learner's deposit is refunded. Otherwise learner is charged, employer is refunded.
* Learn to Earn Model
  * Variation 1: A learner gets paid after meeting certain criteria. No upfront fee is required.
  * Variation 2: A learner gets paid after meeting each KPI of the whole criteria. No upfront fee is required.

### Ecosystem Fit 
As far as we know, our protocol would be the first education centric protocol in the ecosystem. 

We're confident to roll this out and have its pratical use so that we would bring good communities to the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem.

Notably, 
* We've been operating a tech education business since 2013.
* We've been operating a Saas education management software since 2015.
* We've piloted some of the concept from the protocol since 2017 and received expected results.

To understand the pallets specified below, it is helpful to understand the following use cases for program fees

* **Learn & Earn Back Model**
  * A learner pays the full course fee, and will get half of that refunded after meeting certain criteria during the learning journey e.g. attendance is met.
* **Sponsored Learning Model**
  * A learner deposits the full course fee, the employer also deposits the full course fee for the learner. When the learner meets certain criteria set by employers, employer's charged, learner's deposit is refunded. Otherwise learner is charged, employer is refunded.
* **Learn to Earn Model**

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation |This will be done at code level as well as updated whitepaper.|
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. | 
| 1. | Program Pallet |Masters can manage programs in this pallet by using create_program, create_intake for program. A program can be a course or project with trackable KPIs.|  
| 2. | RuleEngine Pallet|**This is the most complicated pallet within this milestone**. Users can create rules, a program can link to a rule to determine the actions to be executed. A rule defines 1) KPIs 2) Actions linked to KPIs. An action can be 1) Taking Deposit 2) Refund / Partial Refund 3) Reward 4) Certification 5) ProSet. A ProSet can be 1) Skill 2) Experience.|
| 3. | Enrolment Pallet|Users can enrol_program with fees, cancel_enrolment, master can terminate_enrolment. All the logic herein is determined by the rule set in the program. Actions of the rules are executed automatically.|
| 4. | KPI Pallet |In the rule applied to the program, it requires KPI logs to determine if the criteria in the rule is met for the program. If certain / all KPIs are met, the actions within the rule will be executed in the pallet. Actions could be taking deposit, refund, partial refund, reward, certification etc. Program owners can also apply the rule to the program in this pallet.
| 5. | Sponsorship Pallet |Anyone can sponsor_someone to take on a program. e.g. Employer sponsor an apprentice to learn a course. For more, please refer to use case overview: Sponsored Learning Model|  
| 6. | Attendance Pallet|log_attendance is a special KPI of a program. A learner needs to scan the QR code displayed randomly on the course content or UI. The scan will trigger an extrinsic to function to proof the engagement. In the future, we will create an mobile app to scan the QR code and make calls to the node. |  
| 7. | Endorse Pallet | Users can endorse others with skills and experience. Yes endorsement comes with a cost, it will be more trustworlthy than LinkedIn.|  
| 8. | Substrate chain | The pallets within this milestone will be hosted by the Thunderous Network, a substrate based blockchain. |  
| 9. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

## Future Plans

After developing the protocol, we will start implementing the dapp. We are very interested to integrate with Kusama and Polkadot to share the secuirty. We will be interested to do crowd funding to connect with Polkadot.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

**What work has been done so far?**

* We've proved the model with centralized solution.
* We've created our branding and website.
* The white paper had been done and ready to make public.

**Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?**

MVP Studio, our group company, had invested all the resources into this project so far.

**Have you applied for other grants so far**

The other team (Bit.country) under our group had also applied for the open grant which had been approved.
Their team will offer us some mentorship along the way. Some of us worked in the same office based in Auckland, New Zealand.
