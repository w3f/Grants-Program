# Open Grant Proposal


* **Project:** Thunderous Network - an Industry-Drive Education Protocol. 
* **Proposer:** https://github.com/kaicodex
* **Payment Address:** 1LBN9Y6BpSBAWLpsV1FVog9DiCxut2gmPA

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

**Brief description of the project**

Thunderous Protocol is the blockchain network implementing the industry-driven education protocol. Thunder.University will be the DApp using Thunderous protocol.

**An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.**

* Create our own blockchain network with Substrate technologies.
* Develop the pallets/runtime modules for the education protocol.
* Interested to launch on Kusama, then conduct IPO to get a slot on Polkadot.

**An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.**

* Launched the Substrate Runtime Developer Program. We worked together with Parity Technologies and Acala Network. We'd love to use this protocol to run the program one day. More http://ic.guru/substrate
* We've been using industry-driven & apprentice-master approach at Industry Connect - a global tech education that our group owns.
* We've also been operating a successful education Saas software which gives us the rich knowledge in education management. More info http://aimy.io
* We've piloted the concept of the protocol with tokenization in a centralized solution, we've received amazing result. More info http://io.ic.guru/


### Project Details 

The whole project consists of two main components. This application is for the blockchain/protocol part.

* The blockchain and protocol, it is called Thunderous Network.
* The DApp implementing the protocol, it is called Thunder University.

Here are some creatives illustrating how the protocol will work

### Ecosystem Fit 
As far as we know, our protocol would be the first education centric  protocol in the ecosystem. 

We're confident to roll this out and have its pratical use so that we would bring good communities to the ecosystem.

Notably, 
* We've been operating a tech education business since 2013.
* We've been operating a Saas education management software since 2015.
* We've piloted some of the concept from the protocol since 2017 and received expected results.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 1 Month
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  2.5 FTE
* **Total Costs:** 1 BTC

### Implement Substrate Modules 
* **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
* **FTE:**  2.5
* **Costs:** 1 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

## Future Plans
After developing the protocol, we will start implementing the dapp. 

We are very interested to integrate with Kusama and Polkadot to share the secuirty.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign: 

**What work has been done so far?**

* We've proved the model with centralized solution.
* We've created our branding and website.
* The white paper had been done and ready to make public.

**Are there are any teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project?**

MVP Studio, our group company, had invested all the resources into this project so far.

**Have you applied for other grants so far**

The other team (Bit.country) under our group had also applied for the open grant which had been approved.
Their team will offer us some mentorship along the way. Some of us worked in the same office based in Auckland, New Zealand.
