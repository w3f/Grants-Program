## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- BetterBetterLifeChain - Empowering Personal Health and Environmental Sustainability Through Blockchain
- BetterLifeChain is a blockchain-based platform that incentivizes individuals to adopt healthier and more sustainable lifestyles. By setting and achieving personal goals, users earn rewards, contributing to a global movement towards better health and environmental preservation.
- BetterLifeChain will be built on Substrate, taking advantage of its flexibility and scalability to support a global user base. The platform will utilize Polkadot’s cross-chain interoperability to connect with other health and environmental dApps, enhancing user experience and expanding our ecosystem.
- Our team is passionate about leveraging technology for social good. The integration of health and environmental sustainability, powered by blockchain, presents a unique opportunity to make a significant impact on global wellness and ecological health. Crypto industry as a whole seem to be more interested in casino type behavior with meme coins and NFTs, we would like to showcase the truly transformative blockchain technology to better the life of individuals and make the world better through incentivizing healthy and sustainable living. 

### Project Details

- Mockups/designs of any UI components: 
  - We'd like to have a clean and intuitive UI, but we don't have any mockups yet. We would like to use the grant to hire a designer to create the mockups.
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality:
  - [Data Models & API Specs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qjhJ-r8YqEHySBUjmj9_r-He-dvBraimzvNJtxvRE0/edit?usp=sharing)
- An overview of the technology stack to be used: 
  - Substrate for blockchain development using the Frame framework, React for frontend, Node.js for backend, Python for indexing and AI algorithms for personalized insights.
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
  - [Core Components](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-jNUCjyBCBXlaBCa_E4YwFPDULjXBw2IDQer6v1TwGs/edit?usp=sharing)
- What the chain will *not* provide or implement:
    - BetterLifeChain will not directly provide medical services or environmental certifications but will partner with certified entities for such services.

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - BetterLifeChain fills a gap in the Polkadot ecosystem for a platform that bridges personal wellness with environmental sustainability, utilizing blockchain to motivate and reward positive lifestyle changes.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - Our platform targets individual users seeking healthier and more sustainable lifestyles, as well as businesses and organizations in the health, wellness, and environmental sectors.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - The growing awareness around personal health and environmental sustainability, combined with the lack of integrated solutions that address both through incentivization. There are centralized competitors in the wellness and environmental sectors, but none that combine the two and utilize blockchain technology for rewards and data security.
- How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.
  - [Feasibility Research](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M1RqySo8iiPawGbLKjdB3uyvB8R9hqj5LfqMac9Oj1M/edit?usp=sharing) 
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
    - Not that I'm aware of, BetterLifeChain's unique integration of both sides of the interaction, alongside incentivization mechanisms, sets it apart. Health, wellness and environmental sustainability are all important areas of focus for the Polkadot ecosystem, but BetterLifeChain is the first to combine them in this way.
- Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?
  - There are a few centralized platforms that offer rewards for health and wellness activities, but none that integrate environmental sustainability and utilize blockchain technology.

## Future Plans

### Financing Project's Long-term Maintenance and Development
- Tokenomics Model: We will introduce a sustainable tokenomics model around LifeTokens, the native token of BetterLifeChain, which will be used to incentivize users, facilitate transactions within the platform, and access premium features. A portion of transaction fees and services on the platform will be allocated to a development fund dedicated to maintenance and future enhancements.
- Partnerships and Collaborations: Establishing partnerships with health and environmental organizations, as well as businesses interested in accessing anonymized data, will provide additional revenue streams. These partnerships will involve subscription models, data access fees, and sponsored challenges within the BetterLifeChain ecosystem.
- Grants and Funding: We will continue to seek grants and external funding from blockchain-focused environmental and health initiatives. Our engagement with the Substrate, Polkadot, and broader Web3 communities positions us well to access these opportunities.
- Community Contributions: Leveraging a decentralized governance model, community members will have the opportunity to contribute to the platform’s development directly, both through funding proposals and by participating in the platform's improvement through open-source contributions.

### Short-term Use, Enhancement, and Promotion
- Initial User Acquisition: Launching targeted marketing campaigns focusing on the blockchain, health, and environmental sustainability communities. Early adopters will be crucial for feedback and initial network effects.
- Platform Enhancements: Based on user feedback and initial usage data, we will prioritize enhancements that improve user experience, expand functionalities, and integrate additional health and sustainability metrics.
- Strategic Partnerships: In the short term, establishing partnerships with health and wellness influencers, environmental activists, and relevant NGOs to promote BetterLifeChain and drive user engagement.
- Community Building: Hosting virtual and, where possible, physical events to foster a strong BetterLifeChain community. Engaging with users through forums, social media, and direct engagement to build a loyal user base.

### Long-term Plans and Intentions
- Global Expansion: While initial efforts may focus on specific regions or communities, our long-term vision includes global expansion, making BetterLifeChain accessible and beneficial to users worldwide, transcending geographical and cultural boundaries.
- Platform Diversification: Beyond individual health and environmental goals, we plan to diversify the platform to support organizations and businesses in achieving sustainability and wellness objectives, turning BetterLifeChain into a comprehensive ecosystem for health and environmental sustainability.
- Technology Leadership: Continue to be at the forefront of integrating blockchain, AI, and IoT technologies for health and sustainability, ensuring BetterLifeChain remains a leading platform in this space. This includes staying abreast of advancements in blockchain technology to enhance security, scalability, and user experience.
- Driving Social Impact: Ultimately, BetterLifeChain’s long-term intention is to drive significant social impact by making health and sustainability goals more attainable and rewarding for individuals and communities. By doing so, we aim to contribute meaningfully to global efforts against climate change, public health issues, and promoting a sustainable future.

In conclusion, BetterLifeChain is committed to leveraging blockchain technology for good, with a scalable model designed for long-term growth and sustainability. Through strategic planning, community engagement, and continuous innovation, BetterLifeChain aims to become a key player in promoting health and environmental sustainability globally.
