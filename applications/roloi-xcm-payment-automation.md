## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

We are [NeoPower](https://twitter.com/NeoPowerDigital), a Web3 software company. We are currently building a payment automation platform called [Roloi](https://twitter.com/RoloiMoney).

Last year we received a [W3F Grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/roloi_milestone_1.md) for the migration of our Streaming Smart Contract from Cosmos to Polkadot. We talk about this migration journey in a [Medium Article](https://medium.com/@RoloiMoney/cosmwasm-to-ink-beyond-the-cosmos-e4920604f9cb).

Roloi is based on three automation pillars:
- Token streaming
- Recurring payments
- Conditional payments

As a next step for Roloi, we are going to build the **recurring payments feature**. 

Roloi can achieve this by avoiding off-chain mechanisms thanks to [OAK Network](https://oak.tech/): the automation parachain.

### Project Details

#### Goal

Automate ink! smart contract transactions in a recurring way.

#### How to achieve it

We need to notify our Smart Contract deployed on **Shiden** (Astar) whenever a **scheduled transaction** should be executed.

**XCM** enables us to connect parachains. This way, we can schedule transactions on **Shiden** (Astar) with the assistance of **Turing** (OAK). 

#### Technical details

Creating products using XCM implies a complex journey today. Here is an example between Astar and OAK:

![W3F Grant - XCM Payment Automation](https://i.imgur.com/lrjifU5.png)

There are some DX/UX issues while building products with the out-of-the-box approach:
- The process to enable the connection between chains requires the **configuration of Proxy Accounts** on both chains.
- Users have to manually **top up their Proxy Accounts** in order to allow them to pay for fees to act on their behalf.
- **XCM messages are complex** to understand and generate.
- Managing **on-chain recurring transactions** is always a complex task.
- **Polkadot.js** is great for low-level development, but **hard to use for user-oriented products.**

#### Our solution

Our deliverable will include a **Next.js UI** and an **ink! smart contract** to create recurring transfers leveraging XCM features.

The included features on the Next.js UI are:
- ‚úÖ Wallet connection
- ‚úÖ 1-click proxy accounts setup
- ‚úÖ Recurring payment creation
- ‚úÖ Incoming and outgoing payments section
- ‚úÖ useink() library

For devs:
- üíª Our own useful hooks and reusable abstractions in Typescript to encapsulate tasks such as:
  - Creating proxy accounts on both sides
  - Depositing funds into these accounts to cover fees
  - Wrapping the recurring transaction to be executed via Astar Proxy Account
  - Transmitting the recurring task configuration via XCM & HRMP
- üíª ink! smart contract example used to trigger payments
- üíª Recurring payment data model

Some hook examples:

This project will be generic and open source to serve the Polkadot builders community as a **public good** that teams can use to **automate transactions** leveraging **cross-chain features**.

**This will make building with XCM fast and simple.**

### Ecosystem Fit

This project is a **public good for the Polkadot Builders community**. For NeoPower, this will be a great experience since all of this work will give us more traction to **grow Roloi**. 

Our intention is to provide a **generic and open-source project** that can be the starting point to many real use cases of cross-chain payments using XCM. 

The code will be backed with robust and clear documentation. This will allow our platform to be easy-to-use and effortlessly scalable. 

We also plan on publishing a **Medium Article** to **share our experience developing with XCM**.

## Future Plans

- Automate cross-chain token transfers.
- Include conditionals to the transfers.
- Scale this automation platform according to the ecosystem needs. 
- Integrate this code to Roloi to schedule payment flows.
