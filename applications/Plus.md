## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Plus extension will be a user-friendly wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser. It allows users to access their Polkadot account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps. It is actually polkadot js extention, plus some new features.
We don't want to rebuild the wheel, we just want to perfect it, standing on the shoulders of giants like "polkadot js extension" and Make it user-friendlier for users.

The reason why we have decided to work on this project is every day user comments on social medias that complain "why the extension does not show the balance?", "It is too complicated for new/average users to work with", "It is too abstract", " why should we go to another web site to work with the extension", " how could contribute to the crowdloans via extension", and so on. That's why we've decided to work on Plus extension to address such concenrs/requests of the polkadot community.

### Project Details

The new functionalities, that will be added to the original polkadot js extension are:
- View balances
- Transfer funds
- Easy staking (auto stake/unstake/redeem funds and edit nominated validator list)
- Contribute in crowdloans
- Governance
- View transaction history
- View an address as a QR code

The UI of the already woking functionalities:

#### Account page, which shows all accounts balances, and icon buttons to access some features:

#### Transfer funds pages, to enter/choose the recipient address, determine the transfer amount, and finally confirm transfer along with relevant alerts and tooltips:

### Ecosystem Fit

Plus extension will be a user-friendly wallet to interact with the Polkadot/Substrate based blockchains through a browser. It allows users to access their Polkadot account(s), which can also be used to interact with decentralized apps. It is based on the original polkadot js extension, which injects a @polkadot/api signer into a page, along with any associated accounts.


#### Competitive product analysis

Polkadot's browser extension wallet, the currently known competitors are Enzyme, Speckle OS, and Doter.

Enzyme and Speckle OS have very limited features and not been maintained for a long time over a year. Dotter also has very limitted capabilities, so that the functional modules achieved by Plus extension's first milestone have exceeded Doter (Recently, we have completed the first milestone), and more functional modules that will serve the Polkadot ecology will be implemented in the plan.

#### The difference with polkadot.js extension

Polkadot.js extension is an official account management tool, but Plus extension will be not only an account management tool but also implements a series of common functions in Polkadot ecology, such as fund transfer, transaction histrory (including, send, recieve, bond, nominate, bond_extra, redeem, etc), easy staking, easy-to-operate on-chain governance modules, contribute to crowdloans, etc. This means that polkadot js plus can not only do what original extension does, but also independently complete the above mentioned functions, providing users with a one-stop experience, which polkadot.js extension does not have.

From the perspective of UI experience, polkadot js plus tries to not just be more user-userfriendlier but also consistent with the previous taste of the users, who are already familiar with the original polkadot js extension. We try to make the UI more attractive to users, and also support all the languages that are currently existd on the original extension.

#### Product direction and advantages

Analogous to MetaMask, browser extension wallets are convenient to interact with DApps. Plus is positioned as a browser extension wallet and has a first-mover advantage in the product direction. It focuses on the Polkadot ecosystem and enables more users to participate in the Polkadot ecosystem through customized and truly friendly interactive experience.

#### How to maintain the wallet

In the near future, we will have someone in charge of maintaining the Plus extension, not only update it with the original polkadot js extension but also
fix bugs, and even improve the experience，to making Plus as close as possible to a mature browser extension in other ecosystems like MetaMask.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
