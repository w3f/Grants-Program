Fiat-backed stablecoins such as USDT are not decentralized with the risk of being compromised by the central entity; while crypto-backed stablecoins are more vulnerable to price instability, since they are pegged to other cryptocurrencies. The risk of a possible crash for non-collateralized stablecoins is relatively high, since they lack collateral to liquidate the coin back into, while commodity-backed stablecoins might have liquidity problems as physical assets are not so easily liquidated.</li><li>Everlasting Cash is a new kind of stablecoin which solves these issues with a truly decentralized, anti-inflation and stable product with reserves.</li><li>Everlasting Cash a.k.a. ELC is a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin using Substrate with a unique reserve system, i.e. a hybrid of a crypto-collateralized and an algorithmic stablecoin mechanism, with the collateralized mechanism providing the underlying value guarantee, and the algorithmic mechanism incentivizing the participants on one hand, and hedging the downside risk when the demand for the stablecoin is insufficient on the other.</li><li>ELC aims to provide users in the Polkadot ecosystem with a stablecoin that appreciates naturally and achieves the goal of anti-inflation.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a class="hash-link" href="#project-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p>Everlasting Cash (ELC) contracts are written in Rust language and can be deployed to Polkadot/Kusama parachain (ink! pallet).</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technical-design-overview">Technical Design Overview<a class="hash-link" href="#technical-design-overview" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/CycanTech/docs/blob/main/Technical_Design_Overview.png" width="900" class="img_ev3q"><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tokens">Tokens<a class="hash-link" href="#tokens" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>1) Everlasting Parachain Token - ELP
ELP is a native token of the Everlasting Parachain (a parachain on Kusama). Participants are able to send ELP to the ELC multifunction contract as reserve assets to exchange ELC: according to the different system liability ratios, the contract will return both ELC and rELP, or rELP only to participants (see “Reserve” paragraph below).</p><p>2) ELC Token
ELC token is the stablecoin within the ELC contract system, with the initial pegged rate of 1 USD value in the year of 2021. The pegged rate varies over time based on inflation and depends on whether its supply expands or shrinks based on the system LR.</p><p>3) rELP Token
rELP token is a risk asset in the ELC system (an equity in the system). Participants are able to add rELP liquidity to the multifunction pool, which could be realized by sending ELP to ELC contract. The system encourages user to do long-term liquidity mining so as to keep the reserve pool more stable with liquidity.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="multifunction-pool">Multifunction Pool<a class="hash-link" href="#multifunction-pool" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>1) Reserve
Participants can send ELPs to the ELC system in exchange for both ELC and rELP, or rELP alone, depending on what the system liability ratios are. When the system LR is less than 30%, participants who send ELPs to the ELC system can obtain a certain amount of ELC and rELP minted and the LR of the system remains unchanged. When the system LR is higher than 30%, participants who send ELPs to the ELC system will only get rELP,  and this can decrease LR.</p><p>2) Risk Reserve Fund
The risk reserve fund includes two assets (ELPs and ELCs). The purpose of the Risk Reserve Fund is to keep the ELC prices floating between 98% and 102% of the ELC aim price (ELCaim). For example, 1 million ELPs out of the overall 21 million of ELPs initial issuance are used as initial risk reserves.
Such risk reserve fund is used as follows:  when ELP price is lower than 98% of ELCaim, the ELC system will swap ELP for ELC until all ELP in the pool are swapped into ELC to keep the price back to ELCaim. When ELP price is higher than 102% of ELCaim, the ELC system will swap ELC to ELP until all ELCs in the pool are swapped into ELP to keep the price back to ELCaim.</p><p>3) Liquidity Mining
Participants who have deposited ELPs to the reserve pool contract, can obtain rELP and use rELP to participate in the liquid mining. In order to maintain the size of reserves, participants are encouraged to do long-term liquidity mining. Participants who join liquidity mining will earn more tokens if they hold the tokens longer.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="inflation-governance">Inflation Governance<a class="hash-link" href="#inflation-governance" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The generation time of ELP is 6 seconds per block. The ELP target price rises every 10,000 blocks in K, K is an anti-inflation factor. The inflation factor K can be adjusted through the ELP governance mechanism. rELP holders can vote for the adjustment of the anti-inflation factor K when the USD inflation goes into hyperinflation.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="oracle">Oracle<a class="hash-link" href="#oracle" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h4><p>The oracle of reserve asset ELP and stablecoin ELC is implemented with Chainlink-Polkadot.

On the Cycan Network, for instance, anyone can launch a DeFi project, or build an investment portfolio and participate in the decision-making process for any DeFi product on the network.</p><p>The ELC protocol is a smart contract protocol based on the Cycan Network/Everlasting Parachain.</p><p>The Cycan Network (CYA) is an parachain built on the Polkadot network. The Everlasting Parachain (ELP), as Cycan’s canary network, is the parachain on Polkadot’s canary network - Kusama network.</p><p>ELC has a stable target pricing mechanism, called ELCaim. ELCaim is initially set as 1 USD and the pegged rate of ELCaim will be continuously adjusted and stabilized based on the anti-inflation factor (K), forming the anti-inflation algorithmic stablecoin mechanism. ELC not only uses crypto currencies as systemic reserves to decide the basic value of stablecoins, but also uses algorithms to control the supply of ELC so that the prices are at the same level of ELCaim.

• The ELC reserve pool will prioritize tokens from the Polkadot system to build a solid stablecoin ecosystem.
• To provide the users in the Polkadot ecosystem with a stablecoin that appreciates naturally and achieves the goal of anti-inflation.
