## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

The Web3 Bazaar is a peer-to-peer exchange for Web3 assets supported by an escrow smart contract that allows for swaps between any ERC-20 or NFT token between counter-parties that have already agreed to terms.
The Web3 Bazaar connects an easy to use dApp interface with escrow smart contracts on EVM compatible chains that enable the on-chain establishment of trade terms and ensure both parties possess and swap the intended assets in a non-custodial manner.

The Bazaar was built to support P2P trades from all assets on all chains and to provide a safe haven for trustless trades between unknown parties. The Bazaar was built by 3 frens who are active members of the gaming NFT and DeFi space and decided to build it after seeing the explosions in P2P trading scams within Discord groups and subreddits.


### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

| 2. | dApp interface | We will deploy an uodated and fine tunned version of the dApp that will support bundle transactions and checkmarked projects |  
| 3. | Audits | We will audit the smart contracts deployed on Mainnets  |
