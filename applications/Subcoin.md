## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

This project aims to develop a prototype of a Bitcoin full node in Rust using the Substrate framework. The goal is to create a node capable of synchronizing the Bitcoin network from its genesis to the latest tip, utilizing the light state sync strategy provided by Substrate. This feature is currently missing in the existing Bitcoin software.

**Relevance to Substrate & Polkadot**

This project showcases the versatility of Substrate as a leading blockchain development framework. With Substrate, small teams and even individuals can create production-level blockchain software efficiently. Developers within the Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem, particularly those interested in Bitcoin-related applications, stand to benefit from the tools and insights produced by this project. Specifically, the Bitcoin bridge projects can integrate the subcoin-network into their nodes to talk to the Bitcoin network directly instead of relying on the external relayers which are suffered from the single point of failure practically.

**Motivation**

Despite the availability of various Bitcoin client implementations in different languages, there is currently no Substrate-based Bitcoin client. Additionally, majority of the previous attempts to build one in Rust have faced challenges and limitations. One key factor contributing to their shortcomings is the lack of essential libraries like rust-bitcoin and comprehensive blockchain development frameworks like Substrate. However, with the emergence of these tools, there's renewed potential to develop a high-quality, production-ready Rust-based Bitcoin client within the Substrate ecosystem.

Iâ€™m personally planning on some ideas on Bitcoin. This project may be a good starting point for exploring innovative ideas and advancements within the Bitcoin ecosystem.

### Project Details

**Key Deliverables**

- crate `pallet-bitcoin`: This crate implements the core logic of Bitcoin protocol, handling the transaction processing and UTXO set management.
- crate `subcoin-runtime`: A lean Bitcoin specialized Substrate runtime integrating only two pallets frame-system and pallet-bitcoin.
- crate `sc-consensus-nakamoto`: This crate offers an import queue for Bitcoin block import and full block verification.
- crate `subcoin-network`: This crate is responsible for basic Bitcoin P2P network functionalities, facilitating initial block download from other nodes.
- crate `subcoin-node`: This crate orchestrates the integration of all components mentioned above, providing a binary `subcoin` for running a fully functional Bitcoin node.

**Non-Goals**

This application does not aim to replicate the full feature set of a comprehensive Bitcoin client like **`bitcoind`**. As such, functionalities such as wallet management, mining, and mempool operations are outside the scope of this project, which are expected to be pursued in the future.

### Ecosystem Fit

The impact of this project extends beyond the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystems, contributing to the diversity of Bitcoin protocol implementation within the broader blockchain landscape.

- Liu-Cheng Xu
    
    He is a seasoned protocol-level blockchain engineer with extensive experience with the Substrate framework. He was the core developer and subsequent tech lead of ChainX project from 2018 to 2021. Post-ChainX, he embarked on a venture with the permanent storage project Canyon and received the grant [canyon_network](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/df34fc617c88346411319b4293db5eb9cb2769b9/applications/canyon_network.md) for implementing the Proof Of Access consensus with the Substrate ecosystem. Due to regulatory changes in his country, Canyon was discontinued. He later transitioned to Subspace Labs as the lead protocol engineer, spearheading the execution layer development in Subspace's modular solution from 2021 to 2023.

## Development Status :open_book:

A preliminary prototype of a Bitcoin node has been developed, featuring the capability to import Bitcoin blocks directly from the `bitcoind` database. A document [Design Notes](https://www.notion.so/915ff68a2b3c43b1ac37048c88d551ed?pvs=21) has been compiled to outline implementation considerations and provide guidance for ongoing development efforts

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview
