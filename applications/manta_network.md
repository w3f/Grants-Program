## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Manta Network is the first privacy-preserving DeFi stack powered by zkSNARK. It includes the Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP)  and Decentralzied Anonymous eXchange (DAX). Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) is a decentralized anonymous payment scheme for Polkadot and Parachain assets (including wrapped assets and stablecoins). Decentralzied Anonymous eXchange (DAX) is a decentralized anonymous exchange scheme based on AMM and zkSNARK.


### Overview

[Manta Network](www.manta.network) team aims to develop a private preserving decentralized exchange on Polkadot eco-system using zkSNARK. Below is an overview of Manta platform:

The details of Manta DAP and DAX schemes can be found section 3, and section 4 of 
[Manta White Paper](https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta-Whitepaper/blob/main/manta-whitepaper.pdf). It will based on the following cryptographic primitives:
* A statiscally-hidding non-interative commitment scheme, we are planning to use Pedersen hash in the actual construction.
* zkSNARK, we are planning to use [arkworks snark construction](https://github.com/arkworks-rs/snark) based on Groth16.
* Public key encryption, we are planning to use the ZK friendly ElGamal scheme.

### Project Details

#### Manta DAP

Manta DAP has support two kinds transactions:
* `tx_mint`: mint private coins from public coins (base coins).
* `tx_transfer`: transfer private coins to private/public coins.

(Please see section 3 of [the white paper](https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta-Whitepaper/blob/main/manta-whitepaper.pdf) for more details.)

##### Mint private coins from base coins

To mint a new private coin, a user `u` needs to initiate a coin minting transaction
`tx_mint` with the deposit of base coin, more specically:
1. `u` samples a random number, which is a secret value that determines the private coins serial number (Note: `tx_mint` didn't include this number).
2. `u` commits her public key `a_pk`, the value of the coin `v`, and the random secret `s` that she sampled in the last step in a two stage commitments.
3. `u` thus mint a private coin and only put the value, the first stage commitment, the random secret for the second stage commitment, and the final commitment.
4. The ledger verifies that the `u` indeed deposits base coin of value `v` and add the final commitment to the merkle tree that represent ledger state.

##### Transfer private coins

Private coins can be spent and transferred by `tx_transfer`, which takes a set of input private coins to be consumed, and transfers their total value to a set of output coins: which could be either private or public.

To transfer a private coin, a user need to provide a zero knowledge proof of she knows 
the old coins, new coins, and the secret key of old coin such that:
1. both the new coins and old coins are well formed
2. the address secret key matches the public key
3. the old coin's commitment appears as a leaf of the merkle tree representing ledger state
4. The set of old coins and the set of new coins have the same total value (minus transaction fee).

The new coin will be posted on chain using public key encryption.

#### Manta DAX

Manta Decentralized Anonymous eXchange scheme is based on zkSNARK and AMM. The overall design intuition is that the ledger maintains `x*y = k` (or using some more sophiscated curve) invariant for an exchange pair. The validation logic requires that trader provide an zero-knowledge proof of the fulfillment of this invariant after trading. Below is a simplified architecture of Manta DAX:

<img src="https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta-Whitepaper/raw/main/manta-arch.png" width="500">

(Please see section 4 of [the white paper](https://github.com/Manta-Network/Manta-Whitepaper/blob/main/manta-whitepaper.pdf) for more details.)

### Implementation 

Manta DAP will be a substrate module. The ledger state will be a list of Merkle roots, 
i.e. `(L_A, L_B, ..., L_N)`, where each merkle root represents the commitment list of a base coin. Manta DAP also support registering new coins that is compatiable with Manta DAP interface.  

We will implement Manta as two parts:
* A substrate node that implement Manta DAP/DAX protocol.
* A client that can initiate transactions and generating zero-knowledge proofs.

We will only build Decentralized Anonymous Payment (DAP) in this grant since the whole project (DAP+ DAX) is too large to be implemented in only one grant. 

### Ecosystem Fit

The current ecentralized exchanges scheme lack privacy, anti surveillance interoperability, and anonymous cryptocurrencies’ lack of price stability. As the first decentralized anonymous payment that could support existing assets, Manta DAP will be a great addition to Polkadot eco-system since Polkadot and Parachain assets such as aUSDT and wrapped BTC can be transferred and spent privately. We already talked to Polkadot eco-system members such as Acala and Equilibrium. They showed strong interests of integrating with Manta. Also, Manta DAP will be the an important building block for Manta DAX (Decentralized Anonymous eXchange) scheme that enables privacy preserving AMM style decentralized exchange using zkSNARK.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:


### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 12 weeks
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  3
* **Total Costs:** 1.5 BTC

### Milestone 1 — Manta DAP Protocol Prototype
* **Estimated Duration:** 8 weeks
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 1 BTC

The major deliverable of this milestone is Manta substrate pallet that support the basic DAP scheme:
1. Mint private coin, a user could mint a DOT/KUSAMA coin to a private coin in Manta
2. Transfer private coin, a Manta user could transfer a private coin to another user Manta user by providing an address and a zero-knowledge proof of the private coin that she owns

The Manta substrate pallets includes the ledger state implementation, the transaction validation logic which involves the validation of zero-knowledge proofs. Note that this milestone will only support converting DOT/KUSAMA to private coins.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 1. | Manta Substrate Pallet Protoype | An open-sourced Manta DAP propotype substrate pallet. It will contains several sub-pallets, such as zkSNARK verifier runtime, ledger state and its validation logic, etc. This prototype supports basic functionalities such as mint private coins, transferring private coins. This first version of Manta DAP will only support DOT/KUSAMA.|
| 2. | Benchmark | benchmark on Manta DAP transaction latency and throughput. |
| 3. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the end-to-end use case of Manta DAP.  |


### Milestone 2 — Manta DAP Client and Integration

* **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks
* **FTE:**  3
* **Costs:** 0.5 BTC

There are two major new deliverable in Milestone 2:
1. Extend the Manta pallet to support parachain assets. We are still figuring out what is the best way of supporting that. This essentially requires a cross-chain communication mechanism such as XCM or XCMP (which hasn't been put into Rococo yet). We are also actively talking to Polkadot eco-systems members such as Acala and Equilibrium to discuss what is the best standard interface for mining parachain asset to private coins.
2. A client prototype, which could:
   * Sign and initiate Mint transactions
   * Generate zero-knowldge proofs and send transfer transaction of private coins
   We plan to benchmark and optimize the efficiency of zero-knowledge proof generation


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 1. | Manta Substrate Node Prototype | Compared with the prototype in Milestone I, we will add support for minting parachain assets to private coins in this prototype.|
| 2. | Manta Client Prototype | The client that could generate `tx_mint` and `tx_transfer` transactions with zero-knowledge proofs. | 
| 3. | Benchmark | We will benchmark the laterncy and throughput of using parachain assets as basecoins, as well as the overhead of prover in the client side.   |
| 4. | Docker | A docker file to that demonstrate both Manta substrate node and Manta client functionalities. |
| 5. | Community & Partner Test | We will deploy the prototype on Kusama/Rococo that allows our community and partners to test |


### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we plan to publish several medium articles/tutorials, including:
* Why DeFi needs Manta, why manta should build on Polkadot? (done, please finds [here](https://medium.com/@mantanetwork/whats-next-for-defi-why-manta-64c3b20516b1))
* Why privacy matters, why the current blockchain transactions are NOT private.
* Manta's innovative design and architecture
* A guide for parachain assets integrating with Manta
* How to use Manta client to execute private transactions

## Future Plans

### Community Plan

Our co-founder Victor is the chair of Harvard Kennedy School Blockchain and Cryptocurrency PIC, which is one of the largest blockchain community in eastern America. He can reach the local tech communities since he organized many Hackathons for the ETH foundation and Dorahacks in Boston. 

Meanwhile, as a famous investor and columnist at top-tier Chinese blockchain media, Victor can engage with China investors and communities based on his connection. So we can build our communities in both US and China for Polkadot and Manta based on our previous experiences and resources. 

We already created the Twitter, WeChat, telegram and medium channels for the Manta Network. In next step, we will work with our investors and partners to widespread it. Moreover, we will select investors to choose those with strong media and community resources. 

Besides, we are actively engaging with Polkadot ecosystem projects like Acala, Equilibrium, Moonbeam, Stafi, Sora and Reef to find opportunities to work together in research, development and community building.

### Development Plan
Manta DAP is the foundational part of [Manta](https://manta.network) project. The future plan of Manta includes:
* Manta DAX scheme that support private exchange of private coins.
* A ceremony tool to do decentralized trusted setup using MPC (secure multi-party computation).
* A community effort to create a open standard for DApp using zkSNARK on Polkadot, so that ZK based applications can be composed together more easily.
* Expanding more use cases to business, and supporting more assets. 
* We are also looking to build a decentralized anonymous saving & lending platform, synthetic private investments, and other DeFi adoption.
