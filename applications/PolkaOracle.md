# PolkaOracle Data Infrastructure (Draft of Proposal)

## Project Description

PolkaOracle is set to build a data infrastructure by applying Off-chain Worker under Polkadot/Substrate Framework. The mission of PolkaOracle is to provide real-time, transparent, reliable and efficient on-chain/off-chain market statistics and social data sources. PolkaOracle will be an important building block in the whole Substrate ecology. PolkaOracle is aiming to build a flexible, self-evolving oracle network based on Polkadot, providing applications or smart contracts with customized real-time on-chain data feeding services. PolkaOracle will adopt the Off-chain Workers architecture of the Substrate 2.0 to build an on-chain Oracle system and is designed to be the parachain/parathread connecting to the Polkadot universe.

PolkaOracle is to build a decentralized Oracle system with advanced technologies. The Off-chain Worker for PolkaOracle will allow execution of expensive, long-running and private tasks such as the Computation-based Data Verification, the Web requests and the random number generation, etc., providing the security, efficiency and randomness of the data feed.

## Use Cases of PolkaOracle Data Infrastructure

Through the PolkaOracle to obtain timely and reliable events outside the insured chain, blockchain-based decentralized insurance can realize automatic payment of insurance such as flight delay insurance.

Stablecoins and encrypted derivatives need to frequently obtain off-chain real-time price data. PolkaOracle can obtain reliable data in multiple scenarios in real time and efficiently.

PolkaOracle can provide real-time and reliable currency prices and borrower’s social media information, providing strong support for the dynamic determination of loan interest rates.

The lightweight PolkaOracle interface that can be deployed on multiple chains provides the possibility for decentralized exchanges to realize cross-chain atomic transactions.

## Legal Structure

The legal structure of the PolkaOracle Foundation is set up and incorporated in British Virgin Islands. 

## Development Roadmap

There will be 3 milestones with each milestone lasting for one month. The PolkaOracle Stablecoin Protocol will be a 3-month project: 

* **M1: Descriptions of the whole system structure and design;**

* **M2: Database, feeding modules, data analysis samples;**

* **M3: Publishing of whole Test set and developer guide.**

## Additional Information

* Work has been done so far
    1. We are drafting and verifying the economic model of the PolkaOracle Data Infrastructure.
    1. We are drafting technical specifications and design of runtime modules.
    1. We are building common runtime modules such as multi-asset tokens that will be used in the PolkaOracle Data Infrastructure.
    1. Several custom components needed for the PolkaOracle parachain and also the technical architecture of the parachain.
