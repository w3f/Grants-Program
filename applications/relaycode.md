## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Relaycode is an advanced extrinsics building platform that enhances the user experience for developers and users in the Polkadot ecosystem. It provides an intuitive interface for building and analyzing extrinsics, making it easier for both novice and experienced users to interact with the network.

Our project aims to simplify the process of creating and submitting extrinsics by offering:
1. A user-friendly interface for building extrinsics across all pallets
2. Real-time encoding and decoding of extrinsic data
3. Wallet integration for seamless signing and submission
4. Comprehensive documentation for each pallet and guides

Relaycode integrates directly with Substrate-based chains, focusing initially on Polkadot, moving on to Kusama and other parachains. It leverages the [Dedot](https://github.com/dedotdev/dedot) library to interact with the networks and provide real-time editing, encoding and decoding of extrinsics.

Our team is passionate about improving the developer experience in the Polkadot ecosystem. We believe that by simplifying the extrinsics building process, we can lower the barrier to entry for new developers and increase the efficiency of experienced ones.

### Project Details

![Relaycode Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/itsyogesh/polkadot-hackathon-2024/refs/heads/main/singapore/27-Relaycode/docs/demo.gif)

- UI Components: We will provide a split-view interface with an extrinsic builder on the left and an information pane on the right. The builder will include dropdown menus for selecting pallets and functions, and input fields for parameters. The information pane will display encoded call data, call hash, and other relevant information.

- Technology Stack:
  - Frontend: React.js with TypeScript
  - State Management: React Context API
  - Styling: Tailwind CSS
  - UI Components: shadcn/ui
  - Blockchain Interaction: dedot
  - Wallet Integration: Polkadot.js extension/Talisman

We chose [dedot](https://github.com/dedotdev/dedot) over [polkadot-api/papi](https://github.com/polkadot-api/polkadot-api) for several reasons:
1. First-class inbuilt support for SCALE codecs in TypeScript, which is crucial for our project's performance in handling real-time changes.
2. Automatic fetching of metadata for any chain, simplifying our development process.
3. Better performance for type handling, which is essential for the real-time encoding and decoding features of Relaycode.

- Core Functionality:
  1. Dynamic loading of all available pallets and their respective functions
  2. Real-time encoding and decoding of extrinsic data
  3. Support for all input types across all pallets
  4. Wallet integration for signing and submitting extrinsics
  5. Color-coded display of encoded call data for easy understanding

- What Relaycode will not provide:
  1. Custom blockchain explorers or block navigators
  2. Extensive transaction history or account management features
  3. Support for non-Substrate based chains

### Ecosystem Fit

Relaycode fills a crucial gap in the Polkadot ecosystem by providing a more intuitive and user-friendly interface for building and analyzing extrinsics. While tools like Polkadot.js Apps offer similar functionality, Relaycode focuses on improving the user experience and lowering the barrier to entry for new developers.

Target Audience:
- Developers building on Substrate-based chains
- Parachain teams needing to test and debug extrinsics
- dApp developers integrating with Polkadot
- Blockchain researchers and auditors

Relaycode addresses the need for a more accessible and efficient extrinsics builder, as identified through:
- Feedback from the Polkadot developer community
- Discussions in Polkadot forums and social channels
- Personal experience with existing tools

## Future Plans

Short-term plans:
- Gather user feedback and implement iterative improvements
- Create video tutorials and host webinars to promote Relaycode and educate the community

Long-term vision:
- Expand Relaycode to support other Substrate-based chains beyond Polkadot
- Develop additional features such as extrinsic templates and a visual extrinsic builder
- Explore possibilities for integration with other tools in the Polkadot ecosystem

To ensure long-term maintenance and development:
- We plan to seek additional funding through ecosystem grants and potentially through a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) specifically created for Relaycode
- We will build a community around Relaycode, encouraging open-source contributions
- We will explore partnership opportunities with parachain teams and other projects in the ecosystem

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** We were encouraged to apply by the hackathon organizers after presenting our project.

- We have already developed a working prototype as part of the hackathon, which demonstrates the core functionality of Relaycode.
- Our team is committed to the long-term development of this project and sees it as a valuable contribution to the Polkadot ecosystem.
- We are open to feedback and suggestions from the Web3 Foundation team to further align our project with the needs of the ecosystem.
