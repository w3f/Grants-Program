## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

![Untitled design (1)](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/Grants-Program/assets/93442895/a33de305-fba2-4a43-ac73-fe3736c03b56)

### Overview

This application is a follow up from our successful [grant delivery](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/1196)

Cyborg Network is developing a DePIN-based marketplace for edge computing resources, enabling latency-sensitive applications to scale globally with ease. Users can seamlessly offload specific low-latency workloads to edge locations while maintaining their core deployment in the cloud. Our vision is to serve as essential middleware at the network edge, orchestrating these tasks to reduce cloud operational costs and enhance existing cloud services. In response to user demand and recognizing the growing importance of distributed AI inference infrastructure, we are prioritizing the development of a decentralized AI compute platform leveraging ZK proofs as our go-to-market strategy.

As part of our previous application, we delivered CyberDock, a product line focused on helping users deploy dockerized containers into our edge server network. We are now focusing on expanding this approach to a new product line called NeuroZK, which will enable AI apps to run Inference Engines backed by ZK proofs.

Users can easily run GPU based inference engines in our crowdsoruced GPU network, with compute integrity verified using a ZK SNARK proof that proves that the inference algorithm was executed with 100% accuracy without revealing the actual inference algorithm nor the query or result data.

We are on a mission to establish Cyborg Network as a Polkadot parachain. Our decision is anchored in several key reasons:

First, we're enticed by their advanced interoperable features, such as shared security and XCM. These functionalities pave the way for seamless integrations with other projects within the ecosystem. We have already initiated talks with a few ecosystem teams like [Peaq](https://www.peaq.network/), [Tanssi](https://www.tanssi.network/), [Ava Protocol](https://avaprotocol.org/) for potential integrations.

Second, the unparalleled ecosystem and technical support provided by Polkadot and Kusama have been instrumental in our development, and we've had the privilege of closely collaborating with them over the years.

Lastly, the substrate framework stands out as the premier tool for crafting blockchains from the ground up in today's landscape. Our commitment to excellence aligns with the capabilities it offers.

We will also be launching a line of pre-configured edge servers in partnership with [Simply NUC](https://simplynuc.com/), our hardware partner. Interested community members in high-demand locations will have the opportunity to purchase and operate these servers either in a co-location data center (recommended) or in their private facility (beta). They will be incentivized based on uptime guarantees and the work contributed to the network, similar to mining in PoW chains.


### Project Details

#### Architecture:

The core of our computing solution relies on both off-chain components and substrate pallets that work harmoniously with each other.

Cyborg is a fusion of a blockchain network and numerous computing clusters, collaborating to offer an effective decentralized solution for verifiable off-chain computing.

Our current goal is to leverage the potential of Substrate to enable coherence among geographically isolated worker nodes. This will create a blockchain-governed task distribution system based on load in different locations globally.

![photo_2024-02-14_23-43-17](https://github.com/Cyborg-Network/Grants-Program/assets/93442895/d50e7582-8f0f-461a-8668-10a828089404)

The Substrate blockchain primarily serves as the framework for deploying containered tasks and facilitating smart contracts related to billing functions.

Once the docker container is deployed, its workload will be protected by software based measures to prevent data leakage.

It seamlessly integrates with the current cloud-native toolchain for developers, typically avoiding the need for code changes.
 
Developers can monitor details such as resource utilization, and the app's health status through the Cyborg Connect application dashboard.

### ZK Snark proof verification 

For this grant application, we will improvise our previous submission to make it live on Paseo and then proceed with developing a decentralized proof verification system to incorporate an on-chain ZK Snark system for verifying AI inference models executed in an off-chain environment. The main components will include the Cyborg AppChain (Deployed on Tanssi's Dancebox testnet), Cyborg Worker node (A custom node implementation to manage running offchain tasks and streaming proofs into pallets for verification), TEE Oracle, and a testing suite.

The objective is to deploy a pre trained AI inference model in servers at different geographical locations based on user requirements. The Substrate blockchain will establish secure communication with worker nodes to issue commands for deploying, testing, and verifying model executions.

We will define a new Substrate node configuration for the Cyborg worker nodes, which users can rent on-demand from the pool of available worker nodes.

### ZK Proof Verification process

Once a task is assigned to a particular worker node and it starts executing the task, at fixed intervals of time (currently arbitrarily set to 60 minutes), the ZK worker component in the worker node will generate a SNARK proof using the PLONK algorithm. We will use an oracle to convey this proof to the verifier pallet, which will evaluate the received proof using the verification key and public data inputs that the user submitted before execution.

The pallet performs a series of elliptic curve operations and field arithmetic (over finite fields) to check the polynomial commitments and evaluations provided in the proof. The commitments must match the expected public inputs and satisfy the polynomial equations set by the PLONK circuit.Permutation arguments and other constraints encoded into the circuit are also validated at this stage. The Pallet checks whether all evaluations and commitments hold for the circuit, using the verification key. If they match, the proof is accepted as valid; otherwise, it is rejected. Once the verification succeeds, the transaction is processed as valid (e.g., approving the computation result). If the verification fails, the transaction is reverted or flagged as invalid.


### Ecosystem Fit

Cyborg Network enhances the Polkadot ecosystem with decentralized edge computing, addressing the increasing demand for AI and IoT applications. We focus on Web2 application providers, opening doors for new users to join the Polkadot ecosystem and support its growth. We are also integrating enterprises that operate edge data centers into the Polkadot ecosystem. Some of our potential partners include [Edge Centres](https://edgecentres.com/) , [Deep Green](https://deepgreen.energy/) , [Heata](https://www.heata.co/) etc.

Though Cyborg and the [Phala Network](https://phala.network/) share aspirations of decentralized computing within the Polkadot/Kusama environment, our technical paths and business aspirations are distinct. Phala Network provides off-chain compute infrastructure for smart contract-based applications by enabling users to integrate 'phat' contracts with their existing smart contract logic. While Cyborg is focused on creating utility for web2 applications.

Another related project appears to be [Wetee](https://github.com/wetee-dao), which employs a comparable technical architecture utilizing TEEs to safeguard user privacy. However, their specific market focus is currently untraceable.

Our ultimate goal is to establish a decentralized edge computing network capable of executing targeted low-latency tasks to enhance system performance and efficiency. This approach aims to reduce the overall cloud footprint by providing an edge-to-cloud continuum, allowing users to augment our services with their existing cloud deployments. This, in turn, opens up new markets, particularly in real-time computation for edge AI and edge IoT devices.

The technological landscape sees a plethora of competitors, each carving their niche with unique technical and market strategies. Renowned names include [Akash Network](https://akash.network/), and [Golem](https://www.golem.network/) .

## Development Status :open_book:

We have completed the development of an on-chain task verification system under CyberDock as a part of our previous grant application, it contained three parts - Substrate pallets, Front end app and k3s worker configurations. While task verification made more sense for batch files, we also developed log streaming to provide work proofs for continously running applications.

<img width="1448" alt="7" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67d7535a-8ea6-4660-8bdd-bc8de22ea639"/>

Through this process, we identified the need for having a much simpler provider onboarding experience, so we are developing a custom node implementation called Cyborg worker nodes using which providers can connect their resources to the Cyborg parachain just by downloading and installing an executable file on their VMs. This also aligns with our focus to launch a plug and play hardware series called 'Cyborg miners' that directly connects to the parachain like an ASIC miner.

Consequently, we will be delivering a ZK based offchain compute verification system, that validates the integrity of executing pre-trained AI models for decentralized AI inferencing on crowdsourced GPUs. For this grant we will use ZK and TEE to uphold data privacy in the system.

We are also working concurrently on integrations with Peaq Network (DID pallet) and [CESS](https://cess.network/) for a decentralized storage product called CyStore. Additionally, we have garnered interest from Peaq to open an HRMP channel for XCM interactions between our chains once we are live.

We have created a UX demo to understand our app flow [Cyborg Network UX demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zrN4TRMDd5ON2xH9F00upcyK-3ofwV4r/view?usp=drivesdk)
