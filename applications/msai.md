## Project Overview
### Overview
Many patients use multiple clinics worldwide, but they face difficulty moving patient records, thus they have to take redundant duplicate tests. It is inconvenient and impractical to carry data folders over particularly between countries.  
To solve this problem we gathered a team of doctors and Eegineers and designed an application. Before we go live, we wanted to store the data in a decentralised manner such that we can establish trust with multiple medical centers.
For further background you can[ read our blog](https://emerald-chicory-55c.notion.site/Why-we-need-a-blockchain-for-health-data-1080c5b727964721822650972c28cab2)

Our goal is to to provide an easy-to-use infrastructure for healthcare applications by customiinge a blockchain Pallet to be able to store information from applications like Epic Systems Mychart. The data should be distributable accessible and auditable.
Essentially we would like to implement something similar to w3c Solid pod but integrated with a blockchain node Substrate node that can be used by all healthcare applications.
Integrating application specific security and storage for every program is a major pain point which is not addressed by blockchains.
A combination of a Substrate blockchain and Solid pod like api [5] would provide the security, decentralisation and immutable record keeping that is needed to make healthcare interoperable.
To make this feasible it needs to be split into stages initially using a smart contract developed in Ink! - WebAssembly which records ownership and access [1] to a data pod with a similar API to Solid PODs [4].

ID verification and data enhancement could be integrated through a Sidecar and or Pallet approach allowing other app developers within the ecosystem to reuse the chain without needing their own backend. 
For a simpler initial design we would enhance the off chain worker storage api[6]. Distributed data could be verified as authentic by having a secure hash stored on the chain [4].
With trust being established by the blockchain layer, any blockchain node that provides faulty data as verified through smart contract hashes will be kicked out and forfiet their staking in the parachains native token.
We also propose specific data format for anonymous tags such that no user identified private data would be exposed
during the whole process. 
The initial user of this parachain would be our own EMR application where users store any medical documents with automated information extraction, along with authenticated GPDR opt out.
Sample screen of users view of how the data will be presented in our implementation can be seen[here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vR5uQkX9I_UdCQwDQpNUkyaIQKtYWfY0_ZhDLQHSxdeybF8QqbaYKNQ6j0obcg5BRhEjSmgI3NkhnhP/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000&slide=id.p1). 

Such a platform would allow game theory incentives and smart contract based marketplaces for data trading to encourage adoption of the reference application. 

Our team has years of research and development on medical data along with senior blockchain developers working with IT capable PhD accredited medical doctor(s). Data collection extraction and real time scaling is also part of Dr S Marvasti's and Dr Mahdi Ghandi's resume .
Furthermore, Dr Marvasti has multiple years experience working with blockchain technologies including ZKP both for cross border fintech and for data analysis through AWS Neptune and AWS Aurora API based databases.
This is a phased plan with part of the design to be implemented in this first phase, which each phase being usable .
in summary benefits of blockchain for this data includes
* Decentralised: Data ownership is not lost to any central authority and access is controlled through secure  NFT like smart contract
* Incentive to participate: various mechanisms  could be developed as smart tokens or native token of the parachain linked to DOT.
* Users:  publishers of health can receive some amount of token as rewards from any sponsor on the platform. 
* Public: The api and parachain would be public so that any other apps such that deal with medical data can use this parachain. 
* The detailed API and openAPI specifications for GRPC and or REST will be documented as part of this proposal.
### Project Details

Data models

We propose to store data encrypted at client side using the Pod api implemented as a simple database on top of the off chain worker local storage. The data would be anonymous at the storage layer and
encrypted with access to ID available only to owner(s) of the NFT controlled via a smart contract. 
This is made possible by our extension to the Off chain worker storage API such that each node that stores data checks if request is coming with a valid signature proving ownership of an account that has the NFT created by the account holder. The distributed smart contract will keep a record of data hashes and account owners as per the reference publication in Nature.
Later we could add functionality to decrypt data at the smart contract level once access to an HSM or secure key storage becomes native to the chain.  
Thus, in this first phase the data may be encrypted outside the blockchain through the Sidecar container service which we will specify and provide a reference implementation.
- The data 
  - Medical ID - consisting of HASH And JSON details which are encrypted and optional; only the secure hash of an ID reference is required. The decryption will be handled by dedicated service which will be open sources to run alongside the Substrate node. 
  - ID are verified by special validation addresses (See diagram) linked to special trusted organization addresses on the parachain
  - ID verification is for users of data to require which authorities they accept. Initially it will be us or other organization we work with like the NHS in the UK.

These two types of data storage access will differ in the that access permission to external storage (pod) account will need to be provided by a dedicated bridging service which internally runs a HSM or Hardware Secure Module.

Addition of MSAI parachain webassembly smart contract for efficient encryption and decryption if necessary 
Storage of NFT
Effecient storage of above tables as JSON


### An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Parachain Scaling:  ![component](https://marvsai.com/img/component.png)
- Each parachain node will be an IPFS like Solid Pod by extending the Off chain Worker local storage API
- Nft representing medical data and access/ownership:  ![component](https://marvsai.com/img/nft_Deploy.png) 
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP we have built backend services using Google GCP and need to now integrate with the Polkadot chain
What we will provide :
App connecting to the Polkadot chain with storage on the blochchain of hash and encryption keys to medical data.
Ultimately when the correct modules are written we intend to store the entire medical data on a sidechain. 
- What we will not provide
  - Data extraction will be a separate project that we may or may not deliver with this
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious
  Data storage for images on chain will be a difficult and may be placed securely on IPFS. The API will be public but our UI and APP will not be.

### Ecosystem Fit

The deliverables described above can be generalized but are intended to be used by any project that would like to leverage encrypted data stored on the blockchain ( via NFT).
Off chain worker local storage provides a good start but it is incredibly difficult to integrate it into a health app and provide smart contract verified hash from authorized 'verifiers'.
So what we are proposing is Polkadot to fund an example application with the necessary extensions and wasm smart contracts that can then be used by any health application.
Integrating this layer of storage with NFT smart contracts makes storage more accessible for developers within the Substrate ecosystem. 
Our proposed system will be usable by any application or system where they deal with health data and get user opt-in thus contributing to demand for the Polkadot ecosystem.

The project is a practical application of web3 technologies which we intend to build wit Polkadot.
Additional benefits include proving Polkadot's scalability as the number of users on the parachain grows by for instance spliting records by region and having a parachain per region as illustrated in our component diagram.
Ultimately consumers will benefit especially if we can attract bigger player like MyCharts (Epic Systens) to also use the shared blockchian as a verifiable, standardized method of sharing data.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Specialising public blockchain for storage and exchange of health data making it easy to use the off chain worker local storage with encyrption and smart contract verified data integrity via hashes as described in [1]. 
- This allows the creation of a federated healthcare system. There are many clinics with independent apps but no simple way to sharing without loosing control over the data.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
Not that we know of;
No project has been able to create a public health blockchain as it is either too slow or ineffective data privacy
e.g 
- Medicalchain - dead in the water either because they use a private unscalable chain no different to current data silos. Furthermore, there is no incentive mechanism to participate in the ecosystem.
- BNB Chain all projects 
- Binance Health -  (more commercial pump and dump than substance) using Binance smart chain that is both expensive and unscaleable being a copy of Ethereum such that NHS and other health systems could also theoretically connect. 
- Solid pods could be considered as solving a similar problem though without a public append only ledger which reduces traceability and auditability of data access.

## Future Plans
- Full implementation of w3 solid pos API
- Adding Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is an emerging technique that allows data
to be processed in encrypted form Extension module to connect to NHS app and other health systems around the work.
- Offchain bridger for faster processing in case of trusted thirdparties
- Promotion through partnerships with private and public clinics 
- Fully distribute storage of the off chain worker
