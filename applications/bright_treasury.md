## Project Overview 

![BrightTreasury logo](https://github.com/bright/bright-treasury-proposal-src/blob/main/bright_treasury_logo%20(1).png)

BrightTreasury - a web app for handling the network treasury module.

### Overview
The aim of the BrightTreasury project is to create a standalone web application along with a PWA representation that would allow performing basic actions on the Treasury module of Polkadot and Kusama Substrate networks (with a potential to support any Substrate-based network with Treasury module). It would allow a more intuitive and lightweight flow of submitting proposals as well as an overview of the Treasury related actions. 


Our focus will be on the regular user’s actions rather than the council perspective for this first release. We want to attract more professionals who could contribute to the community with their ideas and skills but at the same time may not be as fluent in blockchain customs and terminology.


Based on the discussions with the Substrate networks’ users and council members as well as analysis of the comments under Polkadot and Kusama proposal submissions, we identified areas that caused most issues in the Treasury funding process from the user’s perspective. The main needs that were brought up were:
- more intuitive proposal submission flow, with clearer indication of a proposal idea being subject to the community discussion, before submitting to blockchain and committing with bond funds 
- one place for following the submitted proposals, their status and the results of motions
- a unified discussion forum to leave comments about submitted proposals as well as their draft versions (ideas)
- implementation of the new bounties funding mechanism 


Following these needs, we propose a solution that will benefit the Substrate chains communities.
### Project Details
The application will have the proposal lifecycle as its main focus - starting from a more approachable proposal definition, clearly stated two phases of the submission (an Idea for preliminary discussion and the formal Proposal after blockchain confirmation) followed by an intuitive overview of the submitted proposals and their state. 


Technology stack: NestJS and React 


In addition to the currently available functionality within the Treasury module, we plan to introduce supplementary features that can benefit the user experience. 


What is more, as we understand that visual aspects are crucial when talking about user experience, we have prepared the clickable designs that illustrate the main flow we wish to implement. Please find it under the following link: https://xd.adobe.com/view/0bb66d6e-5797-40bc-aa29-c6f71131f402-5ee5/

### Ecosystem Fit
Currently, the Treasury module is a part of the general network management tool. We plan to separate it and develop an independent service, with a more streamlined and intuitive flow and presentation. Such a platform would be more approachable for the users from outside of the blockchain community and have a potential for simpler promotion of the Treasury funded actions. 


Main distinguishing features:
- a more intuitive, two-step flow for submitting proposals (Idea -> Proposal)
- in-app module for more detailed proposal descriptions (like adding milestones) connected with proposal related discussion and - reporting progress on approved proposals
- clear overview of the submitted proposals matched with derived motions and their results
- historical overview of the past spending periods’ proposals that were submitted using the app 
- the first app with dedicated bounties implementation
- in-app login

Definition of Done for each user story:
<ul>
<li>Unit tests passed</li>
<li>Code has been reviewed by peer</li>
<li>Acceptance criteria were met</li>
<li>Internal QA has been performed</li>
<li>Documentation has been written</li>
<li>Screens are responsive and prepared both for desktop and PWA (mobile and tablet)</li>
<li>Browser compatibility</li>
<ul>
<li>Chrome from 70 upwards</li>
  	   <li>Safari from 12 upwards</li>
       <li>Firefox from 57 upwards</li>
   	   <li>Edge from 42 upwards</li>
</ul>
</ul>


At the end of each milestone:
- The user stories listed for the given milestone have been implemented both on frontend and backed and the DoD criteria were met, allowing the user to perform the defined actions
- The functionality has been deployed to stage environment, accessible for testing purposes

### Overview
- Total Estimated Duration: 3 months
- Full-time equivalent (FTE): 1
- Total Costs: 28 500 DAI 

### Milestone 1 — Idea creating & Proposal submission & in-app logins
- Estimated Duration: 1 month
- FTE: 1.1 FTE
- Costs: 10 450 DAI


The main goal of this milestone is to implement the core flow of the app, that is the Proposal lifecycle. As a result the user will be able to create an Idea, add all the necessary details, create Milestones for an Idea, make it public and decide to submit the Idea to the blockchain, turning it into a formal Proposal. The status of the Proposal will be then updated based on the data returning from the API. To perform these actions a user will need to be logged in, however browsing through ideas and proposals will be available to everyone.

The goal of this milestone is to add more features to the ideas and proposals handling. The ideas as well as proposals will have the discussion functionality added and it will be possible to add them to multiple networks as well, as the representation of multiple blockchain networks feature will also be implemented at this stage. What is more, an overview of the treasury statistics will be presented for each network respectively.

The main goal of this milestone is implementation of the bounties mechanism. Users will be able to add and browse through bounties, votings for their curators and check the current status. The curators will be able to accept (or reject) their nominations and manage the bounty’s status. Additionally, in this milestone we plan to add a basic integration with Polkassembly. It will be possible to see the description of a proposal/bounty published on Polkassembly. We will also include the history feature based on the data from Polkassembly, which would allow users to browse through closed proposals and bounties, in addition to in-app ideas.

### Community engagement
It is our priority to make the BrightTreasury app a living part of the community’s life and as such, we plan on several informational activities such as:
- We want to ask Polkadot blog team to kindly agree on us publishing two articles on their blog (https://polkadot.network/blog/): one at the beginning of the project, second as a tutorial at the end of the project
- We will also submit an article to Medium at the end of the project, presenting the application and its potential contribution
- Two blog posts on our Bright Inventions blog https://brightinventions.pl/blog 

## Future Plans
In future, we plan to include a Tips mechanism as well, with a similar intuitive approach. 


What is more, we would like to further integrate with Polkassembly to allow a two-way communication. We plan to display proposals and bounties created using BirghtTreasury (along with their details and discussions) in Polkassembly as well and update any changes in both services.
