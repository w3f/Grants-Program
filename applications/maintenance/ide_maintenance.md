# IDE for ink Smart Contracts Maintenance 

- **Team Name:** Antier Solutions
- **Payment Address:** 1XhNxALoCmXF86aiwZtdDJspjWZBiRX9UfbJ4jQsWN15eSu (DOT)
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This proposal is for a maintenance grant for the RFP - https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/RFPs/Open/IDE_for_ink_Smart_Contracts.md#browser-based-ide-for-ink-smart-contracts
The purpose of this application is to undertake the following: 
1. Update the `@ink-playground` repo and make ready it for online usage.
2. Update and improve the Documentation.

### Overview

- Ink Playground is a web-based application that provides developers with an easy-to-use platform for testing and deploying smart contracts on the Substrate blockchain framework using the Rust programming language.
- With Ink Playground, developers can write and test smart contracts in a sandbox environment without the need for setting up a local development environment. This allows for rapid prototyping and testing of smart contracts without the need for extensive configuration.

- The project should continue to be in use as it:
1. is platform-independent and can be accessed from any device with a web browser, which provides flexibility and accessibility for developers who work on multiple devices or need to switch between operating systems.
2. has a low barrier to entry as it doesn't require installation or setup, allowing users to start coding immediately.
3. Provide for better community support
4. Fastracks user adoption
5. Being browser-based, Ink Playground is more cost-effective than traditional desktop-based IDEs, as it doesn't require expensive software licenses or hardware upgrades.

### Maintenance list

### Team's experience

- Antier is a thought-to-finish partner for customers in their blockchain journey. We advise and consult our clients on blockchain technologies and tailor solutions utilising our powerful blockchain ecosystem. We help customers experiment and deploy proof-of-concepts on blockchain technologies and incrementally expand to scale to production releases. Our thought leaders regularly educate customers, partners, CXOs on the power of blockchain for today and tomorrow.
- Workdone by Antier in Substrate ecosystem
1. Antier worked on the validator and nominator apps for substrate based blockchains to offer a unique and better user experience .
2. We have also worked on creating an optimised and homogenised design focused on improving the navigation, information architecture, user flow tasks, content design and graphic elements for a seamless and easy browsing experience.
3. We have customised the default reward mechanism in the staking pallet of the substrate chain by integrating the sustainability and reliability score(which is calculated by ESG scores and Uptime of the validators repectively) of the validators in the current reward system.
4. We were able to run EVM and WASM machines natively in the substrate chain so that the chain will be able to support both EVM(Metamask, Remix, Web3.js, etc) and WASM(WebAssembly target, INK framework, etc) tooling.
5. We were able to replicate the whole polkadot ecosystem(Relay chain, Parachains, XCM), Where parachains are use case specific chains and communicate through XCM protocol with each other.

- Our team has been proactively participating in the Substrate Stack exchange and we ask/answer question related to ink!, Substrate, parachain. We rank in the top 6% people in the Substrate Stack Exchange.

- Our organisation is the technical partner for 5ire chain: https://5ire.org/

- Our team has worked on multiple IDE which include an EVM compatible IDE for solidity, IDE for WASM contracts for ink! based smart contracts. The EVM IDE is live and the link is : https://ide.5ire.network/

## Development Status :open_book:

This is a maitainance proposal for a project that has already been developed.

## Maintenance Responsibilities :nut_and_bolt:

The `@ink-playground` is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of developing smart contracts but it is currently out of use. There is a list of 20 open issues in this repo as when creating this document. 

Issues we want to fix:

- This IDE is currently not available for usage.
- Massive list of open issues.

Our responsibilities:

- We will maintain the project's documentation.
- We will upgrade the ink! and `cargo-contract` dependencies to the latest stable versions.
- We will answer issues and discussions.
- We will fix new bugs as we receive and help contributors who have pull requests get any needed information.

### Overview

- **Start Date:** Project will start after 3 days post approval.
- **Sprint/Period Duration:** 1 Month/4 Weeks 
- **Total Duration:** 6 months initially, will continue as per the work and support of the Web3 foundation Team
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  2 FTE
- **Max budget per sprint/period:** 5120 USD/Sprint
- **Hourly rate:** 16USD/Dev

## Future Plans

We intend to upgrade the ink! and `cargo-contract` dependencies to the latest stable versions for as long as the project remains funded.

We expect minor bug reports and feature requests, but do not intend to make major changes to the project, or introduce major new features.

We expect to continue to be involved in the Substrate / Ink! ecosystems, and to make additional grant proposals in the future.
