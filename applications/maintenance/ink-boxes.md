## Maintenance Responsibilities :nut_and_bolt:

This section should specify what kind of tasks and responsibilities the maintainer team will cover during future development. If you have already outlined a list of issues/bugs or pull requests that need further development - you can specify them here to provide more context on what tasks you will close.

Also, make sure the current project owners are willing to review/accept your contributions (a note here: if you're fully taking over the project, it will make more sense for the current owners to transfer the repository to your organization. If you can't get in touch with them, you may, of course, work on a fork).

Below we provide **example maintenance responsibilities**.

Issues we want to fix:

- Velocity of !ink and PolkaJS improvements could be overwhelming. I intend to fix it by creating GitHub Actions to track and implement it.
- Massive lack of documentation and part of it is outdated.
- Code has no comments, and it's tough for new developers to understand the code and contribute.
- Frontend is very basic. It can be improved a lot.
- Using latest GitOps practices to maintain code.

My responsibilities:

- I will maintain the project's documentation.
- I will answer issues and discussions.
- I will fix new bugs as we receive and help contributors who have pull requests get any needed information.
- Will keep on looking for more maintainers for ink-boxes.

> ⚠️ *Note that all code should be published under an open-source license during the maintenance period.*
