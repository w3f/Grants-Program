## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/docs/RFPs) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Maintenance Responsibilities :nut_and_bolt:

This section should specify what kind of tasks and responsibilities the maintainer team will cover during future development. If you have already outlined a list of issues/bugs or pull requests that need further development - you can specify them here to provide more context on what tasks you will close.

Also, make sure the current project owners are willing to review/accept your contributions (a note here: if you're fully taking over the project, it will make more sense for the current owners to transfer the repository to your organization. If you can't get in touch with them, you may, of course, work on a fork).

Below we provide **example maintenance responsibilities**.

Issues we want to fix:

- There's a bug in the JsonRPC library that affects its speed.
- Massive lack of documentation and part of it is outdated.
- Code has no comments, and it's tough for new developers to understand the code and contribute.

Our responsibilities:

- We will maintain the project's documentation.
- We will answer issues and discussions.
- We will fix new bugs as we receive and help contributors who have pull requests get any needed information.

> ⚠️ *Note that all code should be published under an open-source license during the maintenance period.*

### Overview

- **Start Date:** Date, when you plan to start with the maintenance work.
- **Sprint/Period Duration:** Duration of the sprint/period (e.g. 4 weeks)
- **Total Duration:** Duration of the entire maintenance contract (e.g. 1 year)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Max budget per sprint/period:** Requested max budget in USD per sprint/period (e.g. 7,000 USD).
- **Hourly rate:** Amount of budget per hour, since it’s unlikely that the maintenance of the project requires the exact same workload each sprint.

> ⚠️ *Note that you will need to provide a comprehensive report of the work done at the end of each month, including the list of issues/bugs/pull requests worked on, time spent on each of these, & finally, the associated cost. The time allocation & price will likely vary from month to month, depending on the nature of the project you're contributing to. The report should be in the form of a Milestone Delivery, again like the typical procedure. W3F will make the payments only after the successful merge of each individual report.*

## Future Plans

Please include here

- how you intend to use, enhance, promote and support the projects in the short term, and
- the team's long-term plans and intentions in relation to it.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Maintenance Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- Work you have already done.
- Whether there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.
- Previous grants you may have applied for.
