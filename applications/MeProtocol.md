### Overview

**What is the Me Protocol?**
 It is a blockchain protocol that will power the first decentralized multi-vendor loyalty ecosystem for brands competing in the Web3 space.

**Background:**

**Loyalty rewards are moving to a blockchain near you**
Wouldn’t it be great if you could buy a coffee with unused airline miles? Or if your rewards never expired, and you could trade them? Whether it’s sports teams, airlines, hotels, Highstreet fashion or your local pizzeria, brands from almost every sector are looking to take advantage of what blockchain technology can do to transform the **$180b in global loyalty rewards by allowing rewards to be exchanged and redeemed across brands.** 

**Blockchain-based rewards are great for consumers, but also for brands:**
1.Customers not using rewards are **3x more likely to defect from a brand.**
2.While brands try their best to provide attractive offers, **less than half of rewards are actually used.** This is **$90b of value left on the table.**
3.Rewards on a blockchain can be more easily exchanged than traditional points, meaning **when a current customer cannot immediately use their rewards, they can exchange them with someone who can.**
4.This means **existing customers are happy and new customers are acquired** – unachievable with traditional loyalty programs.

**Making blockchain-based rewards work in practice however requires solving two general problems:**
1.**Accessibility** – Simply creating a reward token that can be exchanged doesn’t mean that it will be exchanged.
a.Where do you go to redeem the rewards? 
b.How do you exchange them? 
c.Most consumers will not bother to search for loyalty redemption options, then go find a DEX, then a peer and then calculate what they need to swap to get the rewards they need.
**Solution** – We are building a dedicated **‘reverse’ marketplace** for blockchain-based loyalty rewards. Simplified redemption, for everyone, from every brand, with the exchange complexity hidden in the background.
2.**Liquidity** – Just because a brand wants to release reward tokens, doesn’t mean they can be easily exchanged in a marketplace.
a.What is the value of these reward tokens?
b.How do we ensure that the exchange brings benefits to the brand as well?
c.How do we balance inflow and outflow and drive new customers to brands?
d.What do we do about tokens on different blockchains?


**Solution: The Me Protocol.** Specifically designed to power the emerging brand economy by facilitating the exchange of brand loyalty rewards. 

**Why are we motivated to build in the Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem?**
We like the ecosystem for several reasons:

We share the same philosophy of interoperability.
Our exchange functionality utilizes the concept of decentralized exchanges but engineered for loyalty rewards, leveraging Polkadot's ecosystem for cross-chain operations.
As we continue to develop our protocol, it should integrate with other related protocols and be used by other applications without being constrained to one network.


**Why are we interested in creating this project?**
We are interested in creating this project because it solves one of the biggest problem in the loyalty space, a problem causing an estimate of over $90billion effective loss. We have done a great study of the space and can clearly see that the solution is heavily needed and would be eventually implemented by any team who pays close attention to the loyalty space even if we don’t implement it.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where do we fit in the Web3 ecosystem?**
In as much as we can generalize, our project fits somewhere in the middle of Social (shareable rewards), DeFi/Exchange (rewards economy), Identity (allowing users to own the data keys to their loyalty) spaces. If you consider ‘ecommerce’ a sector, then we are definitely there (decentralized commerce). 

 **Target Audience**
We hope the project attracts dapp and other developers to build integrations and participate in the further development of the protocol.
The protocol will integrate with our marketplace so the target audience for that includes everyday consumers and brands/businesses seeking to transition to blockchain-based loyalty programs
Web3-based projects with utility/reward tokens, social protocols, etc. that want to increase the value of their rewards.

**Needs that we meet**
In addition to those covered in the above sections:
Web3-based applications with utility tokens/rewards are in need of a way to extend out the value of these rewards beyond saying they are listed on an exchange or that they can be used for gas and a few other redemption options. Our protocol and the apps built around it will provide unlimited redemption options, thus increasing reward value for innumerable Web3 projects.
Example: social protocols, leveraging blockchain to facilitate human interaction, can also leverage the Me protocol to boost engagement and provide real value to current and prospective users.

 **Similar projects in the  Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**
A similar project on the DEFI side is Stellaswap (https://stellaswap.com/) and on the loyalty program side is Project Venkmann https://www.venkmanholdings.com/

 **How are we different?**
 - Me Protocol is different from Stellaswap because we are not a typical DEX, we just use the concepts of decentralized exchanges to power our multi-vendor loyalty program and to enable the swapping of loyalty rewards across brands. Consumers of these rewards would hardly know that there is a swap, all they know is that they can spend the same reward across multiple brands.

- Me Protocol is also different from project Venkmann because we do not set out as a loyalty program manager for brands, rather we are the interoperator of loyalty programs, providing one blockchain protocol that brands and even loyalty program managers can integrate to enable a multivendor loyalty ecosystem where rewards can be moved seamlessly across brands with no overhead.

## Future Plans

-We will first incorporate the Me Protocol into our own marketplace. This should provide significant exposure to the project and prove-out its utility for additional projects. Our company, My AI, will be dedicated to supporting the protocol as a core developer during near- and long-term.
We will also be establishing a DAO as we move forward that will provide additional governance of the project as we progressively decentralise.

-We also plan to offer a significant suite of perks, bounties, rewards etc. to contributors of the project to encourage wider participation during the formative period as well as into the longer term.

-Our own native token, the Me Token, will be used to reward community participation from developers and partners. Ecosystem development is central to our near- and long-term plans and we have already started building one.

-In the end, the Me Protocol should be in integral component of the emerging ‘brand economy’ as a key piece of infrastructure for meta- and non-metaverse rewards.
