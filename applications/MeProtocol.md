### Overview

**What is the Me Protocol?**
Me protocol is a blockchain solution that provides a decentralized multi-vendor loyalty ecosystem for brands.

**Background:**
Most brand loyalty programs are currently estimated to be only 46% effective, meaning more than half of the $180billion market valuation is doing no useful work. The inherent problem is rooted in the limited use of the rewards provided by these programs. To dampen this risk, brands are merging to form multivendor programs e.g miles and more, Singapore airlines, etc. where customers can move rewards and get value across brands in the given network. This approach has greatly solved the ineffectiveness of these programs and tremendously improved the customer loyalty index; a KPI used by brands to measure the success of these loyalty programs, but the approach comes with its overhead. The multivendor loyalty programs are not so easy to form, brands need to figure out useful partners, have numerous meetings, sign numerous documents and even in some cases have to agree on an eventual settlement when value is moved. While the approach is effective, its rigorous processes make it less utilized.

Many solutions have emerged to fix this problem by building a well-planned program that can accommodate multiple brands, both LSEs, and SMEs. Even though these solutions are witnessing brand adoption, they have created new problem sets based on their centralized nature.It is now clear that Blockchain technology is the seamless and perfect solution for this, in fact, each of these solutions when placed on a hypothetical path, appear to have been forged to gradually evolve into decentralization.
The Me protocol is a blockchain-based technology, that seeks to seamlessly, frictionlessly, and cost-effectively solve these problems in a decentralized way and also champion the movement towards the vision of “customer-driven rewards”.

**How it simply works:**
The Me protocol comprises two elements, the App and the Exchange Protocol. The app allows users to store or/and keep track of their rewards earned across multiple brands and also provides a marketplace of offers from various brands across the world. The exchange protocol is basically a decentralized exchange that enables a swap of loyalty rewards from one brand reward to another and it differs from Uniswap or other popular Dexs in that the swapping process is not visible to the user, the user only sees that he can redeem his Adidas rewards for an offer from Mc Donalds, but under the hood, the protocol swaps these rewards and pays each brand appropriately.

**How do we integrate with Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama?**
The Exchange functionality utilizes the concept of decentralized exchanges but for loyalty rewards, leveraging Polkadot's ecosystem for cross-chain operation.

**Why are we interested in creating this project?**
We are interested in creating this project because it solves one of the biggest problem in the loyalty space, a problem causing an estimate of over $90billion effective loss. We have done a great study of the space and can clearly see that the solution is heavily needed and would be eventually implemented by any team who pays close attention to the loyalty space even if we don’t implement it.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where do we fit in the Web3 ecosystem?**
Our Project fits into the DEFI and social space

 **Target Audience**
Our target audience include brands/businesses with loyalty or seeking to have loyalty programs and their consumers, web3-based projects with    utility/reward tokens, social protocols e.t.c 

**Needs that we meet**
- Brands, web3 native or not, irrespective of their existing loyalty program can connect to the Me Protocol to access the decentralized multivendor loyalty program, and hence open the doors to new customer acquisition while satisfying existing customers with the same budget.

- Web3-based applications with utility tokens/rewards can connect to the Me protocol and hence enable their users to get more value from their rewards which otherwise tend to become monotonous after a given number of months or years. 

- Social protocols leveraging blockchain to facilitate human interaction can leverage the Me protocol to boost engagement and provide real values to current and prospective users.

- Day-to-day consumers of brand products can now track their rewards in one place, and in this one place see what to spend this on across multiple brands like no other solution.

- Analytics subscribers and providers can leverage the Me protocol to provide due (privacy censored) analytics to needing industries. This fit would revolutionize businesses on a global scale.

 **Similar projects in the  Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**
A similar project on the DEFI side is Stellaswap (https://stellaswap.com/) and on the loyalty program side is Project Venkmann https://www.venkmanholdings.com/

 **How are we different?**
 - Me Protocol is different from Stellaswap because we are not a typical DEX, we just use the concepts of decentralized exchanges to power our multi-vendor loyalty program and to enable the swapping of loyalty rewards across brands. Consumers of these rewards would hardly know that there is a swap, all they know is that they can spend the same reward across multiple brands.

- Me Protocol is also different from project Venkmann because we do not set out as a loyalty program manager for brands, rather we are the interoperator of loyalty programs, providing one blockchain protocol that brands and even loyalty program managers can integrate to enable a multivendor loyalty ecosystem where rewards can be moved seamlessly across brands with no overhead. Consumers are satisfied because they can get more value from the reward issued by any brand on the network and brands can tap into customers from other brands while satisfying new ones with the same loyalty budget.

  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
