## Project Overview : page_facing_up: 
If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.



### Overview
Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project. 

Labs Group is a real estate digitalisation ecosystem on blockchain which consists of advisory, issuance and crowdfunding platforms, as well as a digital security exchange license. Its vision is to disrupt the largest asset class investment by solving the illiquidity and high costs of investment issues. This will be mainly done by fractionalisation by digitisation and the offering of digital trading through both Defi and CeFi solutions.
  
* An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama. 

Labs is going to integrate Polkadot by substrate for its token issuance platform and DEFI application in the real estate industry. Labs is going to incorporate Polkadot chain for fractionalizing real estate assets and building smart contracts and deal flows based on polkadot’s infrastructure, Polkadot will have Labs to handle tokenization of real estate assets and being an example of how real estate assets are tokenized and provide liquidity in the ecosystem. Labs will bring its community to polkadot. While polkadot community will get to know how tokenization of real estate works through Labs applications. 


  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Labs thinks real estate, being the largest single asset class, should be made accessible to all people and not just to a selective few who are privileged. This will in turn encourage financial inclusion which most governments encourage.  By building this ecosystem and thereby disrupting the real estate investment world, this allows everyone with a chance to get involved in sharing the fruits of economic growth, locally or globally. 

LABS team's vision is to help to build a fairer and more equal world.

### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of any UI components
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DXfHWEb9Z9L6lO_ZMQLnQI2bhKcVmIU9?usp=sharing
* API specifications of the core functionality
* An overview of the technology stack to be used
* Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
* PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic


### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours?  If so, how is your project different?

There are some real estate tokenization projects, but none of those doing an ecosystem like labs, Labs is able to build an ecosystem engaging DEFI and CEFI to tokenize real estate assets, and more importantly, labs owns a Security Exchange license in Malaysia to build a STO real estate business including issuing platform, security exchange, defi application to provide liquidity to real estate market.

## Development Roadmap : nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.


* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.

* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture `details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X18Mys_WyRWAxy9Ma81uWe2r1ZVgo1qt1f3QhH2PRuU/edit

* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.

* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 

We will provide the dockerfiles

* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: X | We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone) |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Y | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Z | We will create a Substrate module that will... |  
| 4. | Substrate chain | Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible) |  
| 5. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Example — Additional features
...

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on [Medium](https://medium.com/)). It should explain your work done as part of the grant. 

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.

## Future Plans
Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.

The team is currently integrating with escrow and custody service providers. We plan to continue speaking with a global network of service providers including more secondary market exchanges for additional liquidity. The company aims to provide access and liquidity to the global real estate market. The team is also forming partnerships with regulated broker dealer firms to complaint issue securities in different jurisdictions. The goal of forming or acquiring a prime brokerage allows us to create an ecosystem beneficial to consumers.
