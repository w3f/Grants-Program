### Ecosystem Fit

1. Web3Box allows Polkadot ecosystem users to access Polkadot eco multi-wallet and check out the real-time polkadot dashboard in one-stop.

2. Follow-up: Web3Box provides Polkadot users with risk assessment of parachains, so that Polkadot users can timely and accurately understand the risks of parachains; select the parachains with low risks for users to avoid those with high risks when making investment decisions.
