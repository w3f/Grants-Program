## Project Overview

### Overview

**Web3Box is committed to creating a Web3 UGA platform with a secure environment worldwide**

- In order to prevent inevitable frauds, we propose a privacy-safe sandbox concept, Web3Box, so that all the information of Polkadot ecosystem users is controlled in their local trusted environment.
- Web3Box will become the Web3 portal for Polkadot ecosystem users, giving them one-stop access to all Web3 applications. Polkadot ecosystem users can manage their multi-chain assets and track asset changes, ensuring asset security.
- In response to the frequent Web3 asset security incidents,  Polkadot ecosystem users can track the risks of Polkadot ecosystem projects through the Web3Box, so as to choose Web3 portfolio safely.

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Web3Box allows Polkadot ecosystem users to access Polkadot eco wallet, Defi, Swap, and browse Web3 websites in the privacy-safe sandbox. The data generated in transactions and browsing is securely stored on the Polkadot ecosystem users’ personal computers, which could effectively isolate hackers & viruses and avoid system horse calls & program supervision.

2. Web3Box provides Polkadot users with risk assessment of parachains, so that Polkadot users can timely and accurately understand the risks of parachains; select the parachains with low risks for users to avoid those with high risks when making investment decisions.

3. Web3Box presents the visual Web3 news for Polkadot users, including value-added content services and interactive narrative subjects, bringing better reading experience and more accurate content timeliness. Meanwhile, the unique aggregation function of Web3Box will be improved by Polkadot users in a decentralized manner, including Web3 industry sites, resources and tools. Finally, it will let Polkadot users liberate the conventional webpage favorites in Web2, achieving the one-stop access to all Web3 applications.
