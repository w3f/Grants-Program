## Project Overview

### Overview

**Web3Box is committed to creating a Web3 UGA platform with a secure environment worldwide**

NOTE: UGA stands for Users Generated  Assets, and the platform means a standalone local running environment - Win & Mac Web3Box desktop client

- In order to prevent inevitable frauds, we propose a privacy-safe sandbox concept, Web3Box, so that all the information of Polkadot ecosystem users is controlled in their local trusted environment.
- In response to the frequent Web3 asset security incidents,  Polkadot ecosystem users can track the risks of Polkadot ecosystem projects through the Web3Box, so as to choose Web3 portfolio safely.




### Project Details

### Ecosystem Fit

1. Web3Box allows Polkadot ecosystem users to access Polkadot eco wallet, Defi, Swap, and browse Web3 websites in the privacy-safe sandbox. The data generated in transactions and browsing is securely stored on the Polkadot ecosystem users’ personal computers, which could effectively isolate hackers & viruses and avoid system horse calls & program supervision.

2. Web3Box provides Polkadot users with risk assessment of parachains, so that Polkadot users can timely and accurately understand the risks of parachains; select the parachains with low risks for users to avoid those with high risks when making investment decisions.

| **0d.** | Article | We will publish an **article** in our official [Medium](https://medium.com/@web3box.official) that explains what was done/achieved as part of the grant.  |
| 1. | **Dashboard**:Statistics and display of Polkadot users' assets | Statistics and display of the value of Polkadot users’ onchain assets, statistics and display of the value of input assets & output assets |
| 2. | **Dashboard**:Assets pie chart| Polkadot users' asset distribution pie chart |
| 3. | **Dashboard**:Latest transaction display | View the lastest asset transactions of Polkadot users |
| 4. | **Dashboard**:Real-time assets price | Real-time display of Polkadot eco assets' price |
| 5. | **Electron-based Multi-chain Wallet**:Support Polkadot multi-chain assets | Polkadot ecological multi-chain wallet, including Polkadot, Kusama, Moonbeam, Astar, Acala, Phala, Litentry, etc. |
| 6. | **Electron-based Multi-chain Wallet**:Polkadot multi-chain assets management  | Multi-chain asset management, including asset sending, receiving and transaction record query

**Note**
- Web3Box team will finsih Milestone1, and then start the Milestone 2 Risk Assessment, more details about Milestone2 will be announced by the follow-up grant applicaiton.
- Dashboard data resources: For on-chain assets data, we will get this info from the supported chains' mainnet in real time, like Polkadot Relaychain, Acala Parachain, etc. And for the token price data source, we will get the data from chainlink every 5 mins or 10mins. All data sources are requested in a decentralized way.

## Future Plans

- In the short term, Web3Box team will complete the Milestone1 and Milestone2 on time, and provide the unique privacy-safe sandbox in Polkadot Ecosystem.
- In the long term, Web3Box is aimed to become the most secure and comprehensive Web3 portal, replacing the traditional Web2 Browser.
