## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The growth of Polkadot, leading blockchain platform, presents a challenge for users in understanding and tracking their account activities. Existing solutions lack intuitive and engaging tools to present comprehensive statistics, leaving users with limited insights into their impact within the ecosystem.

DOTLY is an innovative application that addresses this problem head-on. By providing a user-friendly platform with visually captivating and interactive displays, DOTLY transforms Polkadot account statistics into an informative and ingsightful experience. Users gain access to a wide range of statistics, including account overviews, balance and extrinsic histories, badges, and action insights. DOTLY goes beyond numbers by incorporating visually appealing charts.

With DOTLY's intuitive interface, users can understand their account activities at a glance. DOTLY aims to bridge the gap between account statistics and user accessibility, empowering Polkadot account holders to maximize their potential and contribute to the growth and success of the network.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Target audience**

DOTLY targets a diverse range of individuals within the Polkadot ecosystem, including existing Polkadot account owners seeking a comprehensive solution to track and understand their on-chain account activities, new users looking for an intuitive onboarding experience, and ecosystem enthusiasts interested in monitoring their involvement with pursuing badges.

**Impact**

- **Comprehensive Account Insights**: DOTLY offers users comprehensive statistics and insights about their Polkadot accounts, including total transfers, transaction rates, balance summaries, and more. By providing this deep level of visibility, DOTLY enables users to make informed decisions, optimize their engagement, and monitor their progress within the ecosystem.

- **Uniqueness**: While there may be block explorers offering Polkadot ecosystem account statistics, such as balance history (and not much else), DOTLY differentiates itself through its focus on user experience, and rich charts/insights.

## Future Plans

Altough DOTLY is initially focused on Polkadot, it offers detailed balance overview on parachains that user has balances. I plan to expand its capabilities to include other networks within the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Kusama and other parachains. Users can change parachain to see their stats in other parachains as well just like parachain explorers. This will allow users to track and analyze their activities across multiple interconnected networks, providing a comprehensive view of their participation in the wider Web3 ecosystem. 

Also I am planning to add quests that incentivize users to perform certain actions. Altough this is done by badges (for now) that are awarded to users, quests are a bit different. For example I can incentivize users to swap in X protocol, or stake in Y protocol, or provide liquidity in Z protocol. This will be a great way to increase user engagement and participation in the Polkadot ecosystem. The rewards for quests can be DOT, KSM, NFTs, etc. and can be provided from respective X, Y, Z  protocol/tools. This feature is not included in the proposal since it adds complexity to the project and it will take more time to implement.
