## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

This application is *not* in response to an RFP nor a follow-up grant.

### Overview

**One liner:** Platform for Generative AI Assisted Smart Contract Development with Retrieval Augmented Generation

`Ink!jet` is a platform designed to use augmented generative AI with the intent of improving the development lifecycle of `ink!` smart contracts within the Polkadot ecosystem. Recognizing the technically intricate nature of smart contracts and the high level of expertise they demand, our project aims to simplify these complexities, thereby democratizing the creation process.

Existing generative AI have limitations in both the amount of `Rust` and `ink!` code in their training data. Our platform uses a retrieval-augmented generation pipeline with datasets of existing `ink!` smart contracts to bridge this knowledge gap. Injecting vectorstore retrieved code into prompts, this system utilizes in-context learning to improve response quality. Our goal is to enhance the productivity of existing developers through bootstrapping and assisted code interation, while simultaneously lowering the barrier of entry for new developers.

Our team's motivation for the project is twofold. First, we are supporters of decentralized technology and its potential to redefine the digital landscape. We believe that the future of blockchain depends on cross-chain interoperability, which places Polkadot at the center of this emerging need. Second, we are deeply intrigued by the potential of generative AI in software engineering. Our aim is to push the boundaries of what these AI models can achieve in novel contexts, such as the `ink!` programming language, and to explore solutions that empower developers to build within the decentralized ecosystem.

### Project Details

#### UI Mockup:

We are opting for a simplistic UI for ease of use. The tool will be a single-page application, where the left side of the page is an in-browser IDE for the `ink!` smart contract being worked on. The right side is a Chat History where the user can interact with the LLM. Code generations in responses will be automatically populated in the left IDE. 

We provide a dropdown menu of code templates to choose from. The History button will keep a edit history of the smart contract if the user needs to revert to a previous version. The Analyze button will break the code down into chunks (such as its individual functions) and provide feedback for each chunk. The code will also be run through CoinFabrik Scout, and the result returned. The feedback will replace the Chat History, and can be closed once it is read to resume editing.

Users are provided parameters to adjust with their prompts, and can modify the temperature and number of retrieval documents from the vectorstore.

#### Data Model / Architecture

![architecture](https://jyu.llc/inkjet_arch.png)

We are using Docker for containerization of the platform. When a user initiates the application, a new Docker image is started, which houses the RAG-LLM pipeline and a Rust environment. When the smart contract is run or scanned with CoinFabrik, the code is sent to the Rust environment and compiled. The result is returned to the user in the web interface. Single user containerization also prevents code interferences between concurrent users.

For running the smart contract itself, the console responses will be returned for the user to see, such as errors. For vulnerability testing, CoinFabrik Scout offer JSON format for their output, which we will retrieve and return to the user.

#### Stack

We will be using the following technologies:
- Python for RAG-LLM pipeline
 - LlamaIndex and LangChain libraries for data loading, processing, embedding
 - LlamaIndex and LangChain libraries for vectorstore retrieval and LLM interaction with retrieval results
- Pinecone for Vectorstore (with ChromaDB option)
- OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 Model for Embeddings
- OpenAI for LLM (GPT-4-32k, GPT-4-1106-preview)
- ink!/Rust for Smart Contracts
- CoinFabrik Scout for Vulnerabiity Detection
- React.js for Front-End Application
- Docker for Containerization
- Rust for Development Environment within the Container
- Heroku for Hosting

#### Relevant Work

Please see Development Status section.

#### What this project is NOT

We are not providing a for-profit product, and all usage will be free to any developers. The system and datasets will also be public, so developers can choose to host their own version of the system, with modifications if they please.

We are not providing full automation nor replacement for existing developers, this tool is designed to enhance the developement cycle and increase efficiency.

We are not claiming that this system is without fault. Though the system is aimed at mitigating errors and vulnerabilities, there is a degree of inherent randomness when using LLMs for code generation. We will provide stringent disclaimers and advice to users to rigorously test their code before deployment, and advocate for contract auditing.

### Ecosystem Fit

This project fits into the ecosystem as a developer tool. It is aimed at improving the smart contract development cycle through bootstrapping, assisted coding, and iterative feedback. 

The target audience are existing smart contract developers and those looking to start writing smart contracts.

As the programming language ink! is built on top of Rust, there exists some barriers of entry, for both Rust and ink!. 

Rust is a low level language, requiring manual management of memory and pointers. While the language has steady increases in adoption and high ratings, it remains challenging for those coming from other languages and especially new developers. In addition to this complexity, the ink! programming language introduces a handful of macros and does not rely on the standard `std` library. Moreover, managing environment variables are done with a different crate and the code is compiled into WASM instead of machine code.

Acknowledging these technical barriers, our tool aims to facilitate an easier transition towards developing in ink! through guided development. Those who already know Rust can easily step into ink! development, and have the differences in syntax explained. Those who already know ink! will be able to save time writing boilerplate and refining work-in-progress contracts. Users are continuously provided feedback on their code, which saves time spent searching documentation or posting on forums. 

At this point in time, current LLMs provide limited assistance due to the scarcity of Rust and specifically ink! code in their training data, and we aim to bridge this gap through our approach.

To the best of our knowledge, there are no existing projects that are similar at this time.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have conducted extensive research on existing work and the overall feasibility of the project. Here are our findings:

To our knowledge at this time, there are currently three publications assessing the efficacy of LLMs for smart contract auto-completion and generation.
- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02955](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02955)

This publication uses the base model without additional learning, and finds limited success, with security bugs and errors being frequent. We look to address this by providing additional context to prompts through our RAG system, which allows GPT-4 to perform in-context learning.

- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10388](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10388)

This publication utilizes in-context learning with a retrieval system, similar to our approach. They focus solely on generating code comments, not on code itself. They find improved efficacy, which is promising as the design is similar to our system. 

However, their design is distinct from ours as they utilize CodeBert to create the embeddings, which has no Rust code in its training data. This makes it incompatible with ink! smart contracts. They also utilize an older model of GPT, GPT-3.5-turbo, which has been significantly outperformed by GPT-4 on coding benchmarks.

We aim to create an alternative system and while replicating their efficacy improvements, using an embedding model that supports Rust and a more recent GPT model, and extend functionality beyond code comment generation to smart contract code generation.

- [https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09826](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09826)

This publication fine-tunes a GPT-J model on 2 million smart contracts, and tests if performance increases on writing code without security issues. While their methodology involved directly fine-tuning the model and updating the weights, and ours focuses on adding context through retrieval, the underlying concept of providing learning examples to improve performance remains similar. After the original fine-tuning, they find that insecure code was an issue in up to 70% of generations. After additional fine-tuning on vulnerable examples with vulnerability-constrained decoding, they were able to avoid insecure code generation up to 67% of the time. 

We have taken these findings into consideration, and will ensure that the contracts in our dataset are functional. CoinFabrik Scout will be utilized to mitigate vulnerabilities. Use of this tool prevents the need for cross-contamination of our functional smart contracts with vulnerable ones in the vectorstore, the separation of which would have required heavy manual code annotations and metadata tagging.

In terms of related work, we have [ongoing work](https://github.com/yu-jeffy/audit.me) studying the efficacy of vulnerability testing through RAG integrated LLMs on Ethereum Solidity smart contracts. In this study, we built a LangChain RAG-LLM pipeline, and created a vectorstore of 830 vulnerable Solidity smart contracts for retrieval. Results were promising, showing a 1.5x increased efficacy compared to [current literature](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12338). Using this as a proof of concept of RAG-LLM with smart contract data, we look to rebuild the pipeline towards the use case of authoring ink! smart contracts. We will construct a new pipeline from scratch, utilize LlamaIndex alongside LangChain, change the data processing and embedding methodology, and implement a much broader ink! smart contract dataset.
