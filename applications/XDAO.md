We would like to share with you the results of the program we held together with Polygon.
The program enabled users to complete interesting tasks on the knowledge of the XDAO platform, create DAO on Polygon and tackle quests.

During the event, we became the top 1 in terms of the increase in the number of users on Polygon per month.
