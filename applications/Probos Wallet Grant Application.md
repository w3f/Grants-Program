Speaking about your community, we’re determined to bring value through a service that is easy to use and has a community-first go-to-market strategy. Besides allowing people to gather all their wallets in one place, the Probos wallet app will enable the Polkadot/Kusama blockchains users to interact seamlessly with its entire infrastructure - NFT, DeFi, GameFi, Metaverse, and other services, as well as the tokens the network hosts - right from their mobile devices.
