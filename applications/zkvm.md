## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

zkVM aims to bring an easily programmable general purpose STARK based virtual machine to substrate. We believe that zero-knowledge technology is posed
to usher in the next wave of innovation in decentralised systems. However, most zero-knowledge libraries require highly specialised expertise
to construct zero-knowledge circuits that represent a specific computation. If we intend to realise the full potential of zero-knowledge technology
we must reduce the barrier to entry and increase accessibility for developers. This goal can be achieved via the application of zero-knowledge virtual
machines that can be programmed using languages and constructs that are familiar to developers. We believe that there is a huge (largely untapped) potential
for the application of zero-knowledge technology within the substrate ecosystem. We hope that by providing a zkVM we can help realise this potential.

### Project Details

This project will leverage [`Miden VM`](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden), a STARK based zero-knowledge virtual machine built on the
[`Winterfell`](https://github.com/novifinancial/winterfell) proof system. We will provide a pallet implementation that allows for _creation_, _execution_ and
_verification_ of programs on the VM. We will also expose verification via rpc such that client side applications can perform verification of proofs.
STARK proof generation is a resource intensive process and as such it often results in large runtimes.  To make this more concrete, ["the time needed to run the 
program is only about 3% of the time needed to generate the proof"](https://github.com/maticnetwork/miden/blob/next/README.md?plain=1#L143).  Long proof generation time 
poses an issue in substrate chains with constrained block times.  To address this problem we will decouple execution and proving of computation.  Execution of the computation
will take place when the `call` extrinsic is executed and this will add a proving task to a proving queue (FIFO vec) maintained in pallet storage.  We will then provide
an off-chain worker pallet which will be responsible for monitoring this queue and creating proofs.  The off-chain worker will submit the proof via the `submit_proof`
call and the proof will be verified on-chain. 

#### API

```rust
pub fn create(origin: OriginFor<T>, init: Script, num_output: u32) { ... }

pub fn call(origin: OriginFor<T>, target: Address, input: Vec<u32>) { ... }

pub fn submit_proof(origin: OriginFor<T>, target: Address, proof: StarkProof) { ... }

pub fn verify(origin: OriginFor<T>, target: Address, input: Vec<u32>, output: Vec<u32>, proof: StarkProof) { ... }
```

#### Data Model

```rust
pub struct Program {
    pub code_hash: Digest,
    pub input: Vec<u32>,
    pub output: Vec<u32>,
    pub proof: StarkProof
}

pub struct Codes {
    pub code_hash: Digest,
    pub code: Script
}

pub type ProverQueue<T: Config> = StorageValue<_, Vec<Address>>;
```

\*The API and Data Model may be subject to change

### Team's experience

#### Francesco Risitano

Francesco found his passion for complex systems and programming during his particle physics research at CERN where he developed
a machine learning algorithm concerned with particle identification at the ATLAS detector. He then transitioned to industry where he
worked at a telecommunications company applying machine learning models at scale for broadband network assurance and recommendation engines.
Following this he worked at a consultancy where he was the technical lead responsible for architecting and engineering a highly scalable event streaming solution
for government. In this role he was responsible for managing a technical team of 12 members. He gained significant experience across
enterprise architecture, engineering, devops, testing and project management. He then started contributing to open source blockchain projects and found himself
a part-time (evenings / weekends) role building a data oracle. Following this he transitioned full time to blockchain development where he built reef chain,
an EVM compatible substrate based chain. He is also a Mina genesis founding member and participated in Mina's builders program to develop a POC layer 2 rollup based DEX. His
experience at Mina and REEF has fuelled his desire to bring more zero-knowledge technology to the substrate ecosystem and has now left his role at REEF
to focus on achieving this goal.

#### Kin Chan

Kin got his start in programming while modelling acoustic absorbers in MATLAB during his MEng dissertation at university. He then went on to work as a fulltime software engineer
at MirrorWeb, a web archiving startup, where he got his first taste and love for building complex distributed systems. He then moved
onto BJSS, an enterprise consultancy where he was placed on a project to build out the core systems for one of the world's largest online betting platforms and run a Golang bootcamp
alongside to train people how to write highly concurrent and effective code. At present, Kin is working as a senior software engineer at Vonage, a cloud communications provider,
where he is developing a brand new, highly scalable, cloud development platform, which is already being used by some high profile clients. As of late, Kin has redirected his focus
towards blockchain and has been developing DeFi arbitrage bots in his spare time. Over his career, Kin has worked on a wide range of novel solutions to complex problems and is always
looking to solve the next big challenge.

#### Zero Network

Zero Network have been working on implementing zero knowledge libraries and pallet. We have already delivered several grants
such as `plonk` and `zk rollups`. And now working on implementing privacy-preserving transactions blockchain.

- [plonk](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zk-plonk.md)
- [zk rollups](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zk-rollups.md)
- [zero network](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/zero-network.md)

We are well positioned to advise this project as we have experience implementing `pallet` which are compatible with `Substrate` and we have a lot of knowledge about
optimization using parallelize, algorithm and architecture. We are also working on zk-SNARKs friendly `VM` so we would be happy to collaborate.
