##  Project Overview :page_facing_up:

###  Overview

The Splyt protocol is an open-source blockchain inventory observed to be “the next generation of e-commerce”, the next biggest step in digital commerce since the mass-adoption of the internet. A bold statement, but the vision and technology is promising to deliver. We want to become the NFT standard for digital commerce as TCP/IP became for data packet standards for the internet. 

How bitcoin solves the “double spend” problem, Splyt solves the “double-sale” problem by assigning unique NFTs to every physical and digital good sold online. This NFT will track sales between all sales distribution channels and only one can be sold to the end buyer ensuring items are in stock.

Today’s e-commerce market is the fastest growing industry poised to hit $7.5T by 2025. The current e-commerce market is oligopolistic, with a few large players dominating the market. Splyt bridges the gap between brands and consumers in a rapidly changing climate. Splyt turns the marketing power of e-commerce into revenue for affiliates + brands, creating measurable ROI and more sustainable profit share terms. 

This decentralized e-commerce, de-commerce, enables brands to scale at their own organic pace. Splyt removes the grey area between brands and affiliates so that partnerships can focus on building better relationships and doing what they do best- sell good products, without enterprise platforms leveraging their power against the profits of smaller brands.

Splyt’s blockchain eNFT inventory database enables effortless & transparent sales, streamlines multi-platform affiliate sales, and eliminates liability between e-commerce platforms and supply chain. The live-updating inventory and unique eNFT attached to each product prevents the double sell problem.

Splyt simplifies the e-commerce supply chain by assigning unique eNFTs (e-commerce non fungible tokens) to every inventory item, functioning similar to a global blockchain SKU number. Brands upload their inventory with our plugin app, through which our system will automatically tokenize the asset as an eNFT on Splyt’s inventory catalog. Brands set a bounty- or profit share percentage- for each eNFT, creating an affiliate marketplace. Affiliates can then select any product/eNFT to show as a shoppable item on their affiliate site (unless otherwise restricted by the brand, who may select to only list on desired brand-appropriate stores). When a purchase is made, the item gets drop-shipped by the brand and the purchaser receives the eNFT as a proof of purchase.

###  Ecosystem Fit

Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?

***OpenBazaar*** is a blockchain-enabled e-commerce marketplace that launched in 2014. It is a protocol that allows transactions to occur directly in a peer-to-peer network with no middleman. Unlike the Splyt Ecosystem, the OpenBazaar marketplace does not connect sellers to one another to cross-list items in each other’s stores on its platform. Moreover, OpenBazaar currently requires each retailer to run a node on the OpenBazaar peer-to-peer information sharing network, which is a barrier to entry to mainstream marketplaces who are not technically competent to implement such a process and may not recognize the incentive for doing so. By using Ethereum as the peer-to-peer network for inventory discovery, Splyt minimizes the adoption costs because a larger number of Ethereum nodes exist and technical competence for utilizing the network is accelerating at a faster rate.

**Origin Protocol** debuted as an approach to the gig, shared, and service economies, with a focus on providing a listing architecture for ride-sharing, home- and room-sharing, last-mile delivery, and other similar services. Indeed, Origin’s white paper only mentions the shared economy as a potential use case for its system. However, the team appears to have expanded its focus to include retail e-commerce goods. Origin’s demo and beta test display how this is intended to appear.

Splyt recognizes the stark differences in the business operations between shared economy products, such as Uber, AirBnB, and Upwork, and retail e-commerce companies, such as eBay, Amazon, and other retailers. While display is similar in both types of products, the parties involved, game theoretical nuances, supply chains, and even standard listing value metatag frameworks are fundamentally different between those two processes. It is unclear whether Origin’s token economics as designed for the shared economy (as shown in its demo) will cleanly apply to retail e-commerce goods. Splyt recognizes the overlap between shared economy systems and retail goods but believes the two business processes as they currently exist are distinct enough that a single system to unite the two may not be feasible or efficient. We instead choose the narrow focus approach, choosing to optimize our system’s performance on the retail e-commerce goods business flow rather than adding the complexity of a distinct business flow to a unified system. 

Further, Origin has indicated two mechanical or utility benefits for its tokens through its protocol: (i) as a method of exchange to pay for “featured listings'' on marketplaces incorporating its protocol, and (ii) as a means of participating in governance. Splyt does not believe a protocol solution should be used to install token economics for something like featured listings as there does not appear to be enforcement or incentivization mechanisms to ensure that interfaces display listings for which such a benefit has been paid, leaving unclear reason for why anyone party would pay to feature a listing. Splyt and Origin both envision decentralized governance in their token mechanics, but Splyt believes that governance rights (alone) do not provide substantial value to users or holders of tokens because no tokens used purely for voting or other governance rights have found any traction. 

**Boson** is a peer-to-peer system which replicates the benefits of a market intermediary, without the disbenefits of centralized systems, which abuse trust by extracting excess profits and hoarding data, and arbitrated decentralized systems- which add cost and friction. Boson enables the coordination of commerce between buyers and sellers in a decentralized and autonomous manner, minimizing value capture and the need for arbitration. Boson allows buyers and sellers to monetize their commerce data equitably and keeping centralized entities from hoarding their data. Unlike Splyt Core, instead of tokenizing real world product and services themselves,  Boson tokenizes the future commitments to transact, using the stateful NFT vouchers, governed by a novel exchange mechanism. And it does not cover affiliate marketing.

##  Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

  

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

  

For each milestone:

*  Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.

To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).

*  Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.

*  Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.

*  Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.

*  Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.

*  Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

*  Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)

##  Future Plans

The Splyt protocol is an open-source blockchain inventory built to be “the next generation of e-commerce” to push forward global digital commerce for a more sustainable business climate. Splyt’s vision is to be adopted by the masses and used as the foundation for all digital commerce, just as the internet has been mass adapted and built out. The ultimate goal is to make Splyt a self-sustained and organized open source project and move all governance to be decentralized within the foundation. Splyt is building the protocol to be built on and used globally by all businesses, large and small. The protocol is adaptable to user changes and needs, enabling the technology to keep up with changing demands and uses. We want to be synonyms with TCP/IP but for digital commerce transactions.

Splyt is migrating to Polkadot with Plasm in 2021. From there Splyt will get our own substrate and hire RUST engineers to create a flawless and efficient system.
