## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
This Decentralized identifier is a development of its own for the PAID Network, to handle a standard Decentralized Identifier DID Method, for self-sovereign digital identity, verifiable credential and Proof of Citizenship for users of PAID Smart Agreements Protocol.

### Overview

This Decentralized identifier is a development of its own for the PAID Network, to handle a standard Decentralized Identifier DID Method, for self-sovereign digital identity, verifiable credential and Proof of Citizenship how two-step verification, within the W3C standard for Decentralized Identifiers, allowing to create a decentralized identifier, transparent and secure method of attestation of user data within a `chain of trust` scheme.

#### Technologies
* OpenLaw
* MDV
* XDV
* ICAO TRIP

#### Integration with Substrate

Our development pipeline consists of standard EVM compatible tooling with the exception of compilation, which is done by the Solang compiler, which allows us to deploy contracts compiled to Plasm Network in Multiple VM, like eg. EVM contracts compatible based on solidity and WebAssembly contracts compatible based on RUST, both support for Substrate.io/PolkaDOT.


### Project Details 

![PAID Protocol]()

This image explains the process of a workflow registration that can be used with DID:PAID.

A DID Method / DID:PAID workflow looks like:

* User registers in PAID Network, creating his Wallet in Dapp, PAID-Wallet.

* User creates an template agreement or selected a pre existing template.

* If it is the first time that the user creates a Smart Agreements, a process of verification of credentials and Proof of Citizenship begins, Through the creation of a decentralized indicator DID:DPKI,  for the attestation of the user's data and their legal residence.

* PAID Smart Agreements, takes the user's data and builds a JSON SCHEMA based on the VC MODEL standard of the W3C DID.

* 

* User adjusts the parameters and conditions of the selected template agreements, and creates an instance of the Smart Agreements appropriate to your particular requirement.

* Attestation and Verifiable Credentials for Signatures.

* Alice sends signed agreement to Bob, which then executes the agreement request party signatures.

* Signed agreement is stored on chain and off chain and PAID Smart Agreements Protocol workflow is created, compiled and registered.

* On Contract execution, workflow is executed by a workflow gateway, which whitelist allowed users.  

* Contracts calls that are integrated with oracles are called and allows:
 * Applies agreement terms (terms must be classify to numeric, similar to ML Classification).
 * Verify agreement terms subjects (Only supports token price subject in first release).


### Previous Work

- **XDV Technology**: Contains components to create digital signatures for documents using HD Wallet technology and integrates with Swarm (ethereum) and compatible with hardware modules that support PKCS#11 and PKCS#12. Links: https://app.xdv.digital/about/#/ (Spanish), https://app.xdv.digital/
- **MDV**: A Solidity state  machine and workflow engine, using optimized code with RLP encoding. Links: https://gist.github.com/molekilla/b85f1c9de63be3afacbfeca703bb3fe4 (Spanish)


### Ecosystem Fit 

- **OpenLaw**: Smart contract based legal agreements. Links: https://www.openlaw.io/

Our project is different in that our team has had more than a year of experience with making wallets for blockchain dapps and then half a year with deep experience in DID, Swarm, IPFS and document signing, which are the bulk of tech experience as defined in OpenLaw. But our protocol takes it a bit further and uses oracles and ML to make it more automated and allows for hybrid scenarios, where a ML business logic can rank or tag a dispute and then it can be further review by an incentivized human arbitrator, allowing for consensus of a dispute. Compared to OpenLaw, which is OpenCourt API is strictly human based, our protocol excels not only in the dispute/arbitrage, but also at transcribing using RLP instead of a Markup Language based ion JEXL.

Further along, by adding the latest in identity technology, with a standard of W3C DID METHOD develop for us (DID:DPKI) allows us to delegate authority to smart contracts using the DID decentralized identity of the individual or smart contract.

Additionally, it will allow identity verification through a Certification Authority such as Let's Encrypt, allowing to be part of a `chain of trust`, where each hardware and software component is verifiable through a private key and an X.509 certificate. Ensuring that the protocol can be an integral part of any verifiable end-to-end communication scheme or `chain of trust`.

We think this project, while developed in EVM, will allow for better and transparent DeFi projects to be used in the Polkadot ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

Master Ventures, foresees the development of the PAID Smart Agreements Protocol in three clearly defined stages

* **Milestone 1:** Development of a Smart Agreement Template Builder, which converts that contract to the logic of a Smart Contract based on Solidity / Solang, with a set of design patterns that will allow interaction with it in a more dynamic way and malleable. Additionally, a platform to execute actions in that Smart Agreements Template, based on the conditions defined by the Smart Agreements signature parties. Along with the Decentralized Identification System (DID based in standard W3C) with a Credential Verification, based on the DID-CORE VC model, and a two-step authentication option based on MTRD / ICAO TRIP, all this verifiable through of a Certification Authority that generates a PKCS#12 Certificate, the `chain on trust` for the certification of Smart Agreements.

| Number |   Deliverable   | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicensed |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: Builder Template of Smart Agreements | We will create a Substrate module that will allow the creation of predesignated templates with the conditions (clauses) and events most common to the type of contract that the template will be oriented, additionally it will handle a categories and subcategories scheme, which will allow the selection of a system of arbitration specialized in the material to be dealt with in the dispute, which will be resolved by consensus, through a system of incentivized human arbitrator |  
| 2. | Substrate module: Builder Digital Signature in `Chain of Trust` | We will create a Substrate module that will allow the verification by a Certification Authority of the digital signature to be used by Smart Agreements users, allowing PAID Smart Agreements within a `Chain of Trust` scheme, where the entire system, both hardware and software is insured and verified. |  
| 3. | Substrate module: Builder of Smart Agreements | We will create a Substrate module that will allow the adaptation of the selected template for each type of Smart Agreement, eg NDA, lease, payment guarantee, insurance, etc. And verify the data of the signatures parties and the courts and arbitration options available based on the location of the parties and the category of the selected Template, through the Arbitration Services provided by PAID Smart Agreements. |  
| 4. | Substrate module: Follow-up of Smart Agreements | We will create a Substrate module that will allow monitoring of the variables events and functions defined in the PAID Smart Agreements, and verify with them and the interactions of the signature parties, the execution of the Smart Agreements, according to the pre-established conditions at the time of creation, keeping in At all times, a monitoring scheme completely auditable by the parties, or any higher instance, be it arbitration and / or court, as defined in the contract when creating it. |  
| 5. | Substrate chain | The modules Builder Template of Smart Agreements, Builder Digital Signature in Chain of Trust, Builder of Smart Agreements and Follow-up of Smart Agreements, which will be deployed in the Blockchain PolkaDOT, which is done by the solang compiler, which allows us to deploy contracts compiled to Edgeware as WASM contracts compatible with Substrate / PolkaDOT. |  
| 6. | Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our Protocol |
