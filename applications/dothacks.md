## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
### Overview
Blockchain world has been suffering from vulnerabilities, e.g.,

1. in centralized exchange: MtGox hack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox),
2. in cryptography: double-spending in Bytecoin due to small subgroup attack (https://jonasnick.github.io/blog/2017/05/23/exploiting-low-order-generators-in-one-time-ring-signatures/),
3. in smart contracts: The DAO hack (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_DAO_(organization)).

Moreover, since 1) the market value involved is massive, 2) there is still lacking clearly defined or practical legal protections for cryptocurrency users, and 3) the techniques used in blockchains are still emerging and keeping evolving, which makes Blockchain security specialists become more desired, the security concerns of blockchain systems become significantly crucial.

However, there is no current Security Response Center (SRC) existing in the Polkadot ecosystem to mitigate the loss caused by blockchain vulnerabilities.
 
In this RFP, we propose DotHacks, an SRC platform built on a public blockchain, Polkadot in specific, to enable trustless SRC service. What makes it different from conventional ones are: 1) we make use of Polkadot blockchain as the public ledger for persisting records; 2) we use consensus to govern the arbitrations; 3) and we use cryptography to preserve privacy and fairness; 4) we use tokenomics to incentivize the participants.
 
As Polkadot is a project aiming at providing a feasible solution to bridge all other public blockchain projects, we believe that, with its design goal and promising progress, Polkadot is becoming the center of the blockchain world. Thus DotHacks can serve as a comprehensive SRC platform for blockchain projects and achieve its best potential.

### Project Details 
Conventional SRC and crowdsourced bug-bounty platforms (e.g., HackerOne, Bugcrowd) suffer from limitations including:

+ insufficient privacy protection for white-hats
+ insufficient privacy protection for vulnerability reports
+ centralized arbitration mechanism

These are also cases for some decentralized crowdsourced bug-bounty platforms (e.g., https://dvpnet.io/).
 
DotHacks addresses these issues in the following ways:

+ White-hats can choose to submit reports anonymously.
+ DotHacks splits each report into shards and encrypt each shard to mitigate sensitive data leakage. Though a report is sharded, its logic correctness and consistency can still be verified, see section #Sharded report verification for details.
+ DotHacks uses State Channel Network (a layer 2 solution). State channel network enhances report submission privacy by privacy-protected peer-to-peer communication, and the submission can be verified by smart contract once exiting the state channel network and submitted on chain. The submission may come with a dispute, and DotHacks uses an arbitration committee to address disputes.
+ DotHacks uses randomness for an arbitration committee election to improve fairness.
+ On-chain reports are encrypted and each of them comes with a time-lock puzzle. Full vulnerability details will only be disclosed and be public after a set period. Vendors can also choose to keep the full report private.

In specific, DotHacks works as follows:

#### Sharded report verification
To verify a report while mitigating sensitive data leakage, DotHacks shards each report and encrypt them during submission. Common used stage conclusions among shards are extracted, to examine logic consistency and enable cross-shard verification.

Arbitration committee is elected by randomness, to ensure fairness. Neither the whitehats nor vendors can predict who are arbitrators and thus cannot bribe them. Arbitrators can neither collude with each other to learn the full report.
### Ecosystem Fit 
There is no current Security Response CenterÂ or Bug-bounty platform existing in Polkadot ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 
### Overview
* **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
* **FTE:**  12
* **Costs:** $30,000 DAI

We split our milestones into 4 stages.

1. First we plan to implement a bug bounty platform, without dispute resolvings. That is, we consider all parties honest at this stage.
2. We then add layer 2 solution to address dispute resolvings, but with a fixed committee.
3. We add randomness into dispute resolving committee election.
4. Finally, we add decentralized governance for improving vulnerability assessment standards and administration regulations.

In this milestone, we will focus on the first stage. Future stages will be left as follow-ups.

### Milestone 1(for stage 1)
* **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
* **FTE:**  12
* **Costs:** $30,000 DAI
+ Implementation of the runtime modules
    + Bounty management module. A basic user story will be:
        * A vendor can announce a bug bounty program.
        * Whitehats can apply for it.
        * Whitehats submit reports.
        * The vendor approves the report and the whitehat gets rewarded.
    + Reward module. Vendors lock some assets associated with a bug bounty program, and whitehats can redeem if completing a bug bounty program.
    + Reputation module mainly manage vendors and Whitehats' reputation based on the collaboration remarks.
+ Implementation of frontends (DApp UX).

## Future Plans
The mission of Dothacks is to build a fair and secure cybersecurity platform, operating on DotHacks's mission is to build a fair and secure cybersecurity coordination platform, operating on a fully decentralized, proprietary protected public blockchain.

As future plan, we hope to initiate a world-influential community that will attract global whitehats, cybersecurity agencies and vendors to join DotHacks. DotHacks will be fully governed by the community.
