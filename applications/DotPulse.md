## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkadot has increasingly grown the open source developer ecosystem. But there is currently no way to get an activity overview and easily track the development among different Polkadot organisations on Github, understand what is their status, track the contributions made by developers and get an idea on how the repositories evolve. Is really hard to understand how the Polkadot ecosystem is progressing since the data is scattered all over GitHub, with contributors, commits, issues, repositories and PRs data.

The solution that CrossChain Labs presents is going to address the problems described above and will offer clarity on the open source Polkadot’s developer ecosystem. This will be done by scraping the data related to Polkadot’s organisations on GitHub and exposing it in a nicely designed dashboard that allows tracking the number of commits, repositories, contributors, PRs, the top contributors of the month, the evolution of commits and active contributors for each month over the last year and monitoring the recent commits that are being done in the various Polkadot organisations.

### Project Details

Deliverables:

- GitHub Scraper that will collect all the required data from GitHub
- DotPulse APIs that will serve to get the data from the scraper and interact with the DotPulse dashboard
- DotPulse Dashboard that will include:
  - the statistics top section with the overall number of commits, repositories, contributors and PRs
  - contributors of the month
  - commits graph with info regarding the last 12 months
  - issues graph that shows the number of open and closed issues together with their total
  - graph of active contributors for each month over the last year
  - the recent commits section that shows the activity of the ecosystem over the last 30 days, with clickable links to open a commit, its repository or the developer's profile on GitHub

### Ecosystem Fit

The DotPulse project will enable all the interested parties to track the development among different Polkadot organisations on Github, to follow the number of commits, repositories, contributors, PRs, the top contributors of the month, the evolution of commits and active contributors for each month over the last year and monitor the recent commits that are being done in the various Polkadot organisations.

There are many benefits of getting the DotPulse project up and running:

- it offers a clear overview on the open source development that is being done across the various Polkadot organizations, by having all the required data aggregated in one place
- acknowledges the contributors of the month
- displays the active contributors for each month over the last year
- shows the evolution of the number of commits made on GitHub by developers throughout the entire Polkadot ecosystem
- outlines the recent commits
