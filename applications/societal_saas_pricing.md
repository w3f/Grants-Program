### Overview

Societal is a specialized blockchain for the creation and management of internative-native organizations. Societal allows all types of groups or communities to build their own online, transparent, and decentralized organization. Societal bundles all of the tools required to create and manage a DAO in one place. Creators will be empowered to construct a DAO with fungible, non-fungible, or a combination of governance tokens. Societal also offers DAO management tooling features like treasury management, specialized governance, task boards, legal structuring, and accounting. This removes the need to use siloed platforms to manage the operations of a DAO. Whether a creator is looking to build a DAO for their organization, raise and deploy investment capital, or decentralize governance of an NFT project, Societal has the necessary tooling for a seamless end-to-end experience. 

Utilizing Polkdaotâ€™s layer-0 infrastructure and ecosystem, Societal will provide DAOs with both maximum functionality and a cohesive user experience. With features including cross-chain governance and subscription pricing, Societal combines best-in-class features into one vertically integrated product. With integrations into DeFi, privacy, and identity protocols, Societal will enable web3 organizations to seamlessly transition and manage their DAOs into the future.

The Societal team has been building in the Polkadot ecosystem for the past two years. While at a previous Polkadot project, the Societal team noticed a lack of integrated DAO tooling - not only in the Polkadot ecosystem, but in the broader web3 industry as a whole. After analyzing how we might transition and manage our previous project into a DAO, there was no clear path. This, along with the team being both members and council members of various DAOs and noticing the lack of infrastructure, we decided to build a solution - Societal.

### Project Details

Societal Labs has been designing the product vision of the Socital platform for quite some time. We will go over the project details and blockchain architecture in this application and provide references below for more in-depth context.

In Societal's final state, it will offer four main services; Create, Transition, Transfer and Manage. Create will allow any web3 user to create their own DAO. Transition will allow protocols to progressively move towards community ownership. Transfer will allow DAOs to transfer their DAO from an expensive siloed chain to the Sociteal platform. Manage will provide DAOs all the required product features to manage their organization, whether it is a small investment club or a large community-governed protocol.

Societal will offer a wide range of features to create and manage a DAO. The features are split into three categories; Operations, Treasury, and Governance. The Operations features are: job & task boards, payroll, customizable feeds, legal tooling, on-chain reputation, and a web & mobile application. The Treasury features are as follows: treasury wallets (multi-sig), DeFi integrations, on-chain cap table, and accounting. The governance features are: subscription based governance, proposal calendar, built-in governance systems, and private voting.

Societal will vertically integrate with projects to advance its tech stack and product offering, something not seen in most web3 projects today. For example, Societal can integrate DeFi services by working with projects like Acala and Moonbeam, which will allow for active treasury management for DAOs managed with Societal. For private assets and voting, projects like Manta and Phala can provide privacy-enabling functions like zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environments to make this possible. For on-chain credentials, projects like KILT and Litentry can provide KYC and member credentialing services that can be used by DAOs for governance and recruiting.

Finally, Societal plans to progressively transition into a DAO itself. Once the token is launched, a community-run treasury will grow over time until the entire network is owned and operated by the community.

### Ecosystem Fit

As it stands today, the DAO landscape within the Polkadot ecosystem is not as mature as other ecosystems such as Ethereum. This is due to insufficient DAO creation and tooling infrastructure in the ecosystem. Currently, the Polkadot ecosystem does not have the creation, governance, and treasury management tooling products that other major blockchains do. By building these tooling products on Polkadot, both the Polkadot DAO landscape and the broader DAO management tooling space are primed for innovation by utilizing the unique technical abilities that Substrate provides.

The target audience of the Societal application are web3 users who require a platform to easily create and manage their DAOs. Our project will meet the needs of the Polkadot community to create and managane their own DAOs and will be a governace scaling solution for ETH based DAOs.

The projects like Societal in the Polkadot space are Polkassembly, SubDAO, and InvArch. Societal differs from these projects in multiple ways. First, Polkassembly is not building their own parachain and is only a governance platform for large Polkadot projects. Societal wants to allow any web3 user to create their own DAO - not just catering to large established protocols. SubDAO has recently been focusing on smart contract deployments on multiple chains and does not appear to be building a parachain. Societal will build its own parachain and use the technical capabilities of Substrate to be truly token agnostic, connecting with widely used wallets such as MetaMask, to avoid doing multiple chain deployments via smart contracts. InvArch Factory is similar to Societal in the sense that they are building their own parachian, however we plan to offer a SaaS based pricing model so we can change the DAOs a monthly subscription fee and eliminate the fees for the organizations members. Societal will also seek to integrate with other chains, having cross-chain governace execution.

## Development Status :open_book:

Societal has already been working on our project and has completed our MVP. The two main repositories of the Societal project are the [societal-node](https://github.com/sctllabs/societal-node) and the [societal-client](https://github.com/sctllabs/societal-client). These repositories represent the societal blockchain (built with substrate) and the UI. To date or MVP includes the following features: Create a DAO with its own governance token, slecect a governance type (Gov1, ownership weighted voting, NFT voting), create and vote on proposals, and bounties. The Societal chain is also EVM compatible. 


## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 2 FTE
- **Total Costs:**  40,000 USDC

The main purpose of this grant will be creating a subcription based pricing system, that can be implemented into any subsrate chain. 

Societal will use this subcription based pricing system to charge the DAOs on its network a monthly fee, which will allow the DAOs members to interact on-chain without paying gas fees. This will bring current web2 pricing models to web3, increasing user experience and ease of adoption for DAOs, as their members will not have to pay gas fees or hold the chain token to interact with it.


### Milestone 1 â€” Subscription Pricing Pallet
- **Estimated Duration:** 1.5 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 15,000 USD


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Substrate module: Subscription Pricing Pallet | We will create a Substrate pallet that will require organizations on substrate chain's network to pay a monthly subscription, which will allow the organizations members to interact on-chain without paying gas fees. The pallet will do four main things. It will accept a subscription payment from a DAO to the substrate chain's treasury. It will open or lock functions for the DAOs members based on if and when the payment has been made. It will have a time limit for these functions to be open, before another payment is required. Finally, it would specify a maximum amount of function calls that can be executed before the functions are locked and another payment is required, preventing DDos attacks. |



### Milestone 2 â€” Add Subscription Tiers to Pallet

- **Estimated Duration:** 1.5 months
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 15,000 USDC


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works.|
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Substrate Module: Add Subscription Tiers to Pallet | The main delivery of this milestone will be adding differnt subscription tiers to the pallet that was created in milestone 1. This milestone will allow the developer to define different subscription tiers, the price of each tier, what functions and/or pallets are allowed in each tier, and the maximum amount of function calls for each tier. Based on what subcription tier the DAO is paying for, only those functions will be allowed to be called by the DAO and its members. Finally, this milestone will also allow each tier to have a maximum amount of members allowed in the DAO.   |  


### Milestone 3 â€” Add Recurring Subcription Payment to Pallet

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2
- **Costs:** 10,000 USDC


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes and send test transactions, which will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish a tutorial that explains how to use and the functionality of the grant. |
| 1. | Substrate Module: Add Recurring Subcription Payment to Pallet | The main delivery of this milestone will be allowing the DAO to approve recurring subscription payments from the DAOs treasury. The approval for the automic recurring subcription approval will come in the form of a governance proposal. The subcription payment will allow for monthly recurring payments until the subscription in canceled. If funds are not avaible at the time of paymnet, all of the DAO functions except for paying the subscription will be locked. This milestone will make it easier for the DAOs to pay the subscription and not need to approve a proposal every month.  |  


## Future Plans

Societal plans to launch its own parachain and be the go-to DAO Creation and Management platform for Polkadot and all of web3. We believe that this subscription pricing system will be a great on-ramp of DAOs from other ecosystems into Polkadot, as the organization members do not have to purchase the Societal token to participate in on-chain transactions. This will reduce the barrier for these DAOs to use a governance scaling solution for their organization, such as Societal. This subscription payment system can also be used by many substrate chains to reduce this barrier adoption as well.
