## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

DAOsign is a decentralized platform for agreements and policies with publicly verifiable and authorized cryptographic proofs and Governance Automation, designed for DAOs. 
Traditional methods of signing agreements, such as paper-based systems or legacy e-signatures, are prone to fraud and lack transparency, and offer no solution for verification of the signer's identity or signer’s authority to execute the agreement. Instead these systems rely on costly legal proceedings for enforce agreements. 

DAOsign provides publicly verifiable cryptographic proofs; secure, transparent and automated processing of complex Agreements and Policies. 

Furthermore, DAOsign provides robust Governance and Policy Builder platform to provide governance, workflow automation and controls for organization policies and procedures.
### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

DAOsign fit the Governance category and since, Polkadot and Kusama are designed to be community-driven networks that allow for decentralized governance. DAOsign can fit into this ecosystem by providing a platform for DAOs to manage their decision-making processes in a decentralized manner.
Our target audience is not only DAOs, but also all the companies, who have a need to deal with the agreement/policies management including the use case for managing Grants, that was presented to you during our introdution call.
Competitors analysis can be found here: https://docsend.com/view/sbexkxn5su3ahdg8 . Particularly in Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystems we are not aware about any tools, that provide exactly the same functionality.

## Development Status :open_book:

We are currently working on a tech demo (kind of a pre-beta version) and non-blockchain version of DAOsign is available here: https://testnet.daosign.org

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

**Overview**

Total Estimated Duration: 2 months
Full-Time Equivalent (FTE): 2 FTE
