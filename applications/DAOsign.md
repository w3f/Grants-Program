## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

DAOsign is a decentralized platform for agreements and policies with publicly verifiable and authorized cryptographic proofs and Governance Automation, designed for DAOs. 
Traditional methods of signing agreements, such as paper-based systems or legacy e-signatures, are prone to fraud and lack transparency, and offer no solution for verification of the signer's identity or signer’s authority to execute the agreement. Instead these systems rely on costly legal proceedings for enforce agreements. 

DAOsign provides publicly verifiable cryptographic proofs; secure, transparent and automated processing of complex Agreements and Policies. 

Furthermore, DAOsign provides robust Governance and Policy Builder platform to provide governance, workflow automation and controls for organization policies and procedures.
### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious


Things that shouldn’t be part of the application (see also our [FAQ](../docs/faq.md)):
- The (future) tokenomics of your project 
- For non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits
- Business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach

### Ecosystem Fit

DAOsign fit the Governance category and since, Polkadot and Kusama are designed to be community-driven networks that allow for decentralized governance. DAOsign can fit into this ecosystem by providing a platform for DAOs to manage their decision-making processes in a decentralized manner.
Our target audience is not only DAOs, but also all the companies, who have a need to deal with the agreement/policies management including the use case for managing Grants, that was presented to you during our introdution call.
Competitors analysis can be found here: https://docsend.com/view/sbexkxn5su3ahdg8 . Particularly in Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystems we are not aware about any tools, that provide exactly the same functionality.

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/docs/RFPs) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to t his project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

> :exclamation: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.

### Milestone 1 Example — Basic functionality

- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  1,5
