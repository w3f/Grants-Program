# W3F Grant Proposal

- **Project Name:** Polkadart
- **Team Name:** JURIMETRIC TECNOLOGIA LTDA.
- **Payment Address:** 12kizkmmQzRFR5o6BQ5Kufo77RPT787eaFynswQoi42vv2Da (DOT)
- **[Level]:** 2
<br><br/>
## 📄 Project Overview 

### 📌 Overview

- Polkadart is a Dart library that provides a clean wrapper around all the methods exposed by a Polkadot/Substrate network client and defines all the types exposed by a node. It's an equivalent to [polkadot-api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) written in Dart language.

- Development of a library that allows users to connect to Polkadot/Substrate’s nodes on Flutter platform. 

- Our team is developing a ranking-based voting system based on the Substrate's based blockchain and for that, we need to create the Dart-substrate library. Today, there are multiple mobile applications built on Flutter and, until now, there is no possibility to connect to Substrate's nodes. 
<br><br/>
### 📌 Project Details

- An overview of the technology stack to be used:
```
This library will be written purely in Dart technology from scratch.
```
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed:
```
We will follow Polkadot specifications and, as a license for PolkaDart library, we will use Apache 2.0.
```
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement:
```
This project will not support legacy metadata protocols, such as metadata v9, v10, and v11.\
Polkadart will not implement any front-end, since it is going to allow developers to use Dart to
connect to the Substrate based network.
```
- This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious:
```
Polkadart is similar to the project "https://github.com/polkadot-js/api" but for Dart, instead of JavaScript.
```


### 📌 Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Our project is going to allow developers to use Dart/Flutter to connect to the Substrate-based network.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our target audience is the mobile app developer's community.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Polkadart enlarges the range of tools compatible with Polkadot/Substrate, therefore expanding its usability.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
Pocket 4 Polkadot-Dart: https://github.com/Pocket4D/Polkadot-Dart#manually-build
Polkaj: https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj/blob/master/docs/03-rpc-client.adoc
  - If so, how is your project different?
Pocket4 was similar to PolkaDart but it was discontinued for lack of progress and Polkaj is related to Java.

## 🗓️ Future Plans

Until now we are bootstrapping, but we intend to continue to support the project with W3F Grant's help. 

Our intention is to make the library available to whoever has an interest in using it. We need it to build Rankanizer, the next-generation app for enabling multiple-choice anonymous voting. Rankanizer will be a transparent and decentralized voting software built on blockchain technology.
