# Polkadart

- **Team Name:** JURIMETRIC TECNOLOGIA LTDA
- **Payment Address:** 0xF9310880F753a2327146dD19EC2207E6bA482A19 (USDC)
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 3

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- Polkadart is a Dart library that provides a clean wrapper around all the methods exposed by a Polkadot/Substrate network client and defines all the types exposed by a node. It's an equivalent to [polkadot-api](https://github.com/polkadot-js/api) written in Dart language.

- Development of a library that allows users to connect to Polkadot/Substrate’s nodes on Flutter platform. 

- Our team is developing a ranking-based voting system based on the Substrate's based blockchain and for that, we need to create the Dart-substrate library. Today, there are multiple mobile applications built on Flutter and, until now, there is no possibility to connect to Substrate's nodes.

### Project Details

- An overview of the technology stack to be used:
```
This library will be written purely in Dart technology from scratch.
```
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed:
```
We will follow Polkadot specifications and, as a license for PolkaDart library, we will use Apache 2.0.
```
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement:
```
This project will not support legacy metadata protocols, such as metadata v9, v10, v11 and v12. Polkadart will not implement any front-end, since it is going to allow developers to use Dart to connect to the Substrate based network.
```
- This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious:
```
Polkadart is similar to the project "https://github.com/polkadot-js/api" but for Dart, instead of JavaScript.
```

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Our project is going to allow developers to use Dart/Flutter to connect to the Substrate-based network.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Our target audience is the mobile app developer's community.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
Polkadart enlarges the range of tools compatible with Polkadot/Substrate, therefore expanding its usability.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
Pocket 4 Polkadot-Dart: https://github.com/Pocket4D/Polkadot-Dart#manually-build
Polkaj: https://github.com/emeraldpay/polkaj/blob/master/docs/03-rpc-client.adoc
  - If so, how is your project different?
Pocket4 was similar to PolkaDart but it was discontinued for lack of progress and Polkaj is related to Java.

In his free time, he loves to create open-source tools and plugins in dart to help the Flutter community. He is a blockchain enthusiast and is super dedicated to learning and bringing ideas to life.

**Luiza Adena**

Luiza is Jurimetric's Product Manager. She founded a legal tech called Arbi-ON and has experience with problem-solving through creative thinking. Luiza aims to make society more just and she believes Rankanizer has the potential to empower people equally.

**Gabriel Okura**

Gabriel is currently working as a mobile and backend developer at Hype Empreendimentos, and for the past year and a half, he has been having experience building apps in Dart with the Flutter framework. Previously worked with mobile game development at Opala Studios. He is excited about the opportunity to work on Rankanizer and to help build the PolkaDart library to increase his experience with blockchain technology.

**Bruno Pastre**
Bruno is an iOS specialized Software Engineer who has consulted for large tech companies like Coinbase and Wish. 
He is fascinated about writing scalable, testable and maintainable code and has been working on that for the past four years. He's a Apple Developer Academy alumni, performing both as a student and a Junior Mentor, There, he had the opportunity to share his knowledge with the next generation of iOS developers and empower them to develop themselfs.

## Development Status :open_book:

Out of the necessity of having a a library / sdk to use substrate chains in our other planned apps. We will start the development of Polkadart in the Grant's program. The repository that will be used during the development is https://github.com/rankanizer/polkadart. We intend to have it open-source since the beginning and all code will be added through pull-requests.

We decided to divide this project into three milestones. The first one is building the codec and metadata part. Since without this all data would have to be mocked and tested using third-party tools as everything is encoded in the substrate eco-system.

After we are able to encode/decode data from primitive types and metadata's of any chain. We are going to proceed with the connectivity part. Where we will implement the interfaces necessary for communicating with the nodes through RPC.

Finally the last step will be the crypto and utils part where we will have the utilities necessary for signing transactions. After these three milestones are completed we shall have a fully featured library that will enable people in the Dart/Flutter ecosystem to communicate with any substrate based node, sign transactions, encode and decode data. Making it possible for example for people to develop flutter applications for Polkadot using native libraries.
