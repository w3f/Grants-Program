This seems too complicated for non-crypto inspired users, that hinders the mass development of crypto-assured services and also brings overheads for multiple transaction fees.</p><p>At the same time Bitins represents the simplest way to crypto that is currently available: a simple POS transaction or an SMS message are enough to purchase a coupon that is redeemable as Bitcoins. Through a partnership with Kraken exchange and leading Slovenian companies – Petrol and Telekom Slovenije, Bitins became a widely used ramp to crypto that doesn’t include the need for a crypto-wallet or even a banking account.</p><p>Vouchers or coupons remain a specific financial instrument that is regulated in a particular manner. Similar rules have evolved for limited digital payments, used by telecoms, FinTech startups and banks. Bitins was able to explore and integrate both opportunities into a unique platform.</p><p>While the current model is locally profitable and ready for internationalization, as it does provide both the maximal simplicity and services to unbanked/underbanked segments within a growing crypto market, we believe that additional work on the platform would facilitate this route and further enable the envisioned global expansion</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98888366/152210061-f2784234-6712-413f-8fe9-41ba0306f5cf.png" alt="DOT coupons" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Coupons are technically utility tokens by definition. While efficient by current centralized exchanged based standards, BSN together with Bitins sit on the opportunity to widely improve efficiency and reduce system complexity. Direct exchange of coupons to tokens does not only improve the efficiency of the system, but due to existing utility it complies with most legal frameworks by design.</p><p>While this is a robust and logical expansion of Bitins, probably the most lucrative route of further development lies within the future expansion of services on top of the token platform. While integration with existing DeFi systems is logical, there might be enough traction within the basic platform for the development of an own exchange/DeFi platform.</p><p>The system itself as it seen by BSN will have five functional modules:</p><ol><li>Ink! smart contract, that executes all logic for cashflows and coupons operations;</li><li>Centralized system management module for stakeholders (coupons generation, invalidation and financial management);</li><li>Centralized system management module for service provider (commissions management and stats) with front-end service for new off-chain users: all-in-one service for wallet generation and immediate transaction with gas charged from service provider’s pool;</li><li>Management apps;</li><li>User apps.</li></ol><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98888366/155559730-166ed4da-8712-48a3-941f-168f825d1649.png" alt="Architecture 2 drawio" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>In the entire BitIns service each coupon has a code that is issued by a centralized backend and printed on a POS terminal upon payment. A user redeems a coupon using this code.
Under this project the main idea of the service will be redeveloped in a confidential and trustless manner using a smart-contract in a blockchain: each coupon will get two keys (codes) - a private and a personal one: the public one will be stored in the smart contract and the private key will be known only to a buyer/user from the entire coupon (it may be encrypted in a QR-code on the coupon or written in any other safe manner). The destination wallet address for the transaction will be signed by the private key so that no destination wallet spoofing could be done by scams.</p><p>The new proposed smart-contract will become an on-ramp for fiat currencies: a native or non-native token of choice could be issued/exchanged for fiat within a coupon redemption. Some of anticipated ways of fiat-to-crypto exchange:</p><ul><li>issue a native stablecoin upon coupon redemption;</li><li>on-line exchange of the coupon value for native Polkadot or parachain tokens (e.g. DOT, LINK, COMP etc.) or stablecoins like aUSD using Polkadex or other DEX projects in the ecosystem;</li><li>on-line exchange of the coupon value for native assets from other blockchains like BTC using 3rd party EX like Kraken.</li></ul><p>As the token natively represents the bridge from fiat to crypto it can also enable an integration with a DeFi/CeFi environment on top and development of the same further down the road: further parts of the project include developing of a payment widget, that can make a transaction to a target wallet with a crypto-currency of choice without even issuing a personal wallet – straight coupon-to-crypto payments.</p><p>Immediate benefits of the token system would be the integration with global FinTech platforms and NFT markets and potentially expansion of the coupon system to using coupon-issued stablecoins for all transactions.
The key benefits are:</p><ul><li>Enhance payment options for DeFi projects with a fiat-to-crypto ramp;</li><li>Propose a reliable but private and confidential state of payment with crypto assets.</li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-">Team 👥<a href="#team-" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team 👥" title="Direct link to Team 👥">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="team-members">Team members<a href="#team-members" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team members" title="Direct link to Team members">​</a></h3><ul><li>Gregor Knafelc, CEO at BitIns Ltd.</li><li>Andrej Muzevic, member of the Board at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Sergey Cymbal, MBA, CEO at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Sergey Zolotukhin, CTO at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Dmitrii Putilov, Blockchain Department Director at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Dmitrii Volodin, COO at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Ilia Shavrin, Full stack software developer at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Anton Shramko, Full stack software developer at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Ksenia Baranova, QA Lead at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Alexey Vexin, Project Manager at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li><li>Anton Borisov, DevOps Engineer at Bela Supernova d.o.o</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="contact">Contact<a href="#contact" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Contact" title="Direct link to Contact">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Contact Name:</strong> Sergey Cymbal</li><li><strong>Contact Email:</strong> <a href="mailto:sc@bsn.si" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sc@bsn.si</a></li><li><strong>Website:</strong> <a href="https://www.bsn.si" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://www.bsn.si</a>, <a href="https://bitins.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bitins.net/</a></li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="legal-structure">Legal Structure<a href="#legal-structure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Legal Structure" title="Direct link to Legal Structure">​</a></h3><ul><li><strong>Registered Address:</strong> Cesta v Mestni log 55, Ljubljana 1000, Slovenia</li><li><strong>Registered Legal Entity:</strong> BELA SUPERNOVA, sistemske rešitve d.o.o.</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="teams-experience">Team&#x27;s experience<a href="#teams-experience" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience" title="Direct link to Team&#x27;s experience">​</a></h3><p>Our team has extensive expertise on multiple levels starting from progressive vision all the way down to software and solution development.
