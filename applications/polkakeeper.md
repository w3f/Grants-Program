## Polkakeeper - A Community-Led Value Assurance Protocol Empowering DeFi Markets Efficiency on Polkadot

**Project Overview**

Polkakeeper is a decentralized value assurance underwriter that empowers community creation of keeper strategies on the Polkadot network and bridged chains. On Polkakeeper, Strategists create Keepers (smart contracts), which can be executed by Finders who actively search for keeper execution opportunities. Backers are users who deposit their funds or assets into Vaults to back the deployment of keeper strategies.

Keepers are automated on-chain value assurance strategies that increase overall DeFi market efficiencies, such as liquidating undercollateralized positions in lending / margin trading protocols, or smoothing asset prices through arbitrage strategies across exchanges. We expect that as the Polkadot infrastructure matures, Keepers may deploy assets across chains, which give strategies new dimensions in identifying profit opportunities. A simple example of a liquidator keeper module in action would be a strategy that: (i) Finder discovers liquidation opportunity and calls Keeper function; (ii) Keeper checks profit execution logic for liquidation value less funds deployed > 0; (iii) If profit logic is established, Keeper calls borrow function on Vaults, executes liquidation and return funds to Vaults within one transaction.

Upon successful Keeper execution, the profits is distributed among the Strategist, Finder and Vaults. Where funds or assets in Vaults are not utilized, they are deployed to lending protocols and optimized for the best yields across chains.

The vision for Polkakeeper is to become the leading value assurance protocol and through DAO governance, organizes the Polkadot developer and user communities towards optimizing and maintaining high level of market efficiencies for Polkadot DeFi protocols. Polkakeeper is designed to empower community collaboration for Strategists, Finders and users to act collectively, rather than individually.

Polkakeeper is designed as an independent, composable Substrate component that can be seamlessly integrated and deployed across Polkadotâ€™s multi-chain network.

# Sample Scenario

A description of how Polkakeeper Liquidator Module works, by walking through a typical scenario:

## 1\. Installation

1.  Defi product includes Polkakeeper Pallets into the runtime:
    - PolkakeeperVault
    - PolkakeeperLiquidator
    - PolkakeeperLiquidatorAdapter

## 2\. Adaptation

1.  Developers implement functions in PolkakeeperLiquidatorAdapter to fit the destination platform:
    - liquidate
2.  Connect the UserInterface to the extrinsic in the Liquidator runtime.

## 3\. Usage

1.  Backers fund the Vault
2.  Finders execute the Strategy using the extrinsic function or the UI.

# Glossary

- Finder
    
    - A user who identifies opportunities to execute the Keeper strategy against. The finding is done off-chain due to the required computing/network resources needed. The outcome is a transaction that invokes the Keeper which has specific parameters embedded, for example a liquidation.
- Backer
    
    - A user who provides liquidity to the Vaults. By pooling funds, Keepers can execute on liquidation opportunities with leverage. Backers earn from the profits made by the Keeper.
- Vaults
    
    - A pooled user funds module for Backers to add liquidity. Keepers utilize pooled user funds within the Vaults to execute on profit opportunities.
- Strategy: Liquidator.
    
    - Code that executes against a specific DeFi platform to capture liquidation opportunities. For now, this is liquidation extrinsic only. Keeper: Liquidator includes conditional profit-only logic that ensures return of principal back to the Vault.

# Runtime Modules

## Vault

### Methods

```rust
pub fn borrow(asset_id: T::AssetId, amount: T::Balance) -> Result;
pub fn deposit(asset_id: T::AssetId, amount: T::Balance) -> Result;
pub fn withdraw(asset_id: T::AssetId, amount: T::Balance) -> Result;
```

## Liquidator

### Methods

```rust
fn liquidate(
    origin, 
    target_user: T::AccountId, 
    pay_asset_id: T::AssetId, 
    get_asset_id: T::AssetId, 
    pay_asset_amount: T::Balance,
    max_liquidatable: T::Balance,
    borrow_amount: T::Balance
) -> Result;

// liquidate has internal checks for proper valuation of the asset
// using the assetPriceAdapter, so it only executes if 
//     (pay_asset_price * pay_asset_amount) > borrowAmount

```

## LiquidatorAdapter

### Methods

```rust
fn liquidate(
    origin, 
    target_user: T::AccountId, 
    pay_asset_id: T::AssetId, 
    get_asset_id: T::AssetId, 
    pay_asset_amount: T::Balance,
) -> Result;

fn assetPriceAdapter(
    origin,
    asset_id: T::AssetId
) -> Result;

```

# Backend Development

This project has no backend component.

3.  Choose Keeper
4.  See Keeper details
5.  Choose Account/Position to act on
6.  See Asset to Pay
7.  See Asset to Get
8.  See needed Amount to pay
9.  Choose Amount to pay
10. Choose whether to Borrow from Vault
11. See available borrowable amount from Vault

# Team's Experience

Polkakeeper is conceptualized by RAMP DEFI, a leading DeFi project specializing in cross-chain staked liquidity solutions. The team members collectively have commercial experiences in scaling up decentralized projects and node operations, and have deep technical expertise in blockchain protocol developments in various programming languages including Solidity, Javascript and Python.
RAMP helps users unlock the value of non-ERC20 assets by collateralizing them into fungible liquidity and bridging this liquidity into Ethereum. As of today, RAMP had already created integrations across Ethereum, IOST, Tomochain and Tezos, with more integrations under active development.
RAMP is already building cross-chain keeper solutions, and its suite of DeFi products for staked liquidity and value assurance can similarly be customized and launched for the Polkadot network.

- Medium Articles on the product design, integration and tutorials for users.
- Twitter posts covering development and other announcements.
- Community engagement by running a range of incentivised testnets to get more feedback from the existing end-users to improve the Polkakeeper solution.
- On-boarding and seeding the Polkakeeper community via the RAMP community.

## Future Plans

Future Developments will focus on the following:

- Collaboration with DeFi partners on Polkadot
- Bug bounties to enhance security for users
- Community developer grants and incentive programs for Strategists and Finders to develop Polkakeeper and scale up network value

## Additional Information

**What work has been done so far?**
Base layer groundwork has been completed with substrate infrastructure planning. Subsequent bottom up construction of the solution would be developed in parts to ensure each running functionality performs as intended.

Our R&D expenses have been covered thus far via RAMP DEFI with world class investors who took part in RAMP DEFIâ€™s private sale round such as Alameda Research, Mechanism Capital, Arrington XRP, Parafi Capital, among others.

We have further investment interest for follow-on investment should the need arise between the use of this grant and our next source of funding, whether that be the General Grants program or another VC-led investment.

**Have you applied for other grants so far?**
No.
