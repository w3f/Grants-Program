## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

- Abstract

  The decentralized blockchain platform that built for blockchain games and high-frequency applications. Applications running on top of Gafi Network will never bother about the security, transaction fee, malicious accounts, and many other bad factors. They can just focus on gameplay, game experience, or application logic. The Gafi Network supports EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) that projects deploy from Ethereum or Binance Smart Chain to Gafi with little or no change.

- Thanks to Parity technologies
  
  Gafi Network is layer one that builds from the Substrate and is EVM compatible using [Frontier](https://github.com/paritytech/frontier).
  
- Motivating the Cryptoviet team

  As the current project titled [Heroes And Empires](https://heroesempires.com/) is running on Binance Smart Chain, mostly due to the scalability and the cost of operating, we build the platform for Heroes And Empires and many other NFT Blockchain Games.
  We have the experience of What NFT blockchain games need, Why we have to build Gafi Network, and How to build Gafi to solve the problems that current NFT games face when they run on Ethereum, BSC, or even Solana.
  
### Project Details


![Gafi Network Architecture](https://github.com/cryptoviet/he-chain-assets/blob/main/Gafi%20Network%20Architecture.jpg)


- **Gafi Architecture**:
  
  **Inside Players**: Players have to join Gafi Pool to get the privileges. When they are in the Gafi Pool, they won't bother about the transaction fee but they can only make the limited of discounted transactions that are handled by Gafi-TX, there are three different pool services [Upfront](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/upfront-pool), [Staking](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/staking-pool) and [Sponsored](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/sponsored-pool). Please visit Gafi Wiki to get more information about [Gafi Network Structure](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/gafi-network-structure) and [Gafi Pool](https://wiki.gafi.network/learn/gafi-pool). The Gafi Pool will ban 'bad' players with the Autoban mechanism.
  
  **Outside Player**: As a player outside Gafi Pool, you can do anything with no restrictions, but with the 'high' transaction fee. 
  
  
- **Pallet structure**

  The project is broken down into following pallets:

  **proof-address-mapping**: mapping Substrate (AccountId) address with EVM address (H160) by given signature.

  **upfront-pool**: Changing upfront every 'x' amount of time (x depends on the number of players staying in the pool and the number of projects running on Gafi, x will be determined when testnet goes live) to get the discount on the transaction fee.
  
  **staking-pool**: Freeze the amount of token to reduce the transaction fee.
  
  **sponsored-pool**: Provide the service to help the game-creator appeal to their users, the sponsored pool created by the game-creator to pay a part of the transaction fee when players deploy their smart contracts.

  **gafi-tx**: Manage player's transactions on the Gafi Pool, every minute or hour players can only make 'x' discounted transactions. Reduce 'y' percentage of transaction fee. 'x' and 'y' will be and should be determined by DAO.
  
  **game-creator**: With the purpose of rewarding the game's creator, pallet game-creator provides the following main functionality:
    1. Game's creator claim the ownership of the contract by given transaction hash
    2. Withdraw the transaction fee reward
    3. Change the ownership
  
  **pallet-cache**: Store pallet data temporarily.

  **pallet-player**: Handle player information likes id, name, friends...


- **DAO**

  Currently, by design, there are three objects that need to determine through DAO:

    1. Autoban mechanism
  
     There are several rules of Gafi Network that players must follow when they join the pool. These are ideas to keep the pool 'as clean as possible' such as ban/kick AFK(away from keyboard) players, ban/kick players on the Spamming Blacklist.
  
    2. The Gafi Pool fee
  
     Pool fee is another base idea to keep the pool clean, with a reasonable fee determined by DAO, the Gafi Pool can prevent the network from malicious accounts. When many players join the pool, the total network fee charged by the pool can be significant to grow the ecosystem by granting the projects. 
  
    3. The number discounted transaction limit of Gafi-TX

     The idea of Gafi-TX is to protect the network from the DDOS, also determining the right number is important because if the number is not appropriate, it's can drive away many good projects for example. Currently, our Heroes & Empires only need a maximum of 10 TXs/minute but another good PvP game can require 30 TXs/minutes, at this point the limit number is 30 is reasonable for the Gafi Network.
  
Although these ideas would be different in blockchain, we must deploy Heroes & Empires on Gafi to determine those numbers.

### Ecosystem Fit

  At this moment, most of the NFT Gaming projects are running on Ethereum, BSC, or Solana name Axie Infinity, the Sandbox, Decentraland... and as we do the [Heroes and Empires](https://heroesempires.com/). We consider these platforms are "common" chains because they can fit many purposes but don't specialize in NFT Blockchain Games. Inspired by Substrate philosophy that 'builders can just focus on the chain logic', so we built Gafi Network that specialized in NFT Blockchain Game.
  
  We know the 'pain' of scalability and  the cost of operating that Heroes & Empires spent more than $3M just for the transaction fees, we do think if we brought that money to grow the H&E ecosystem that could be game-changing.
  
  Our current user target is the NFT Gaming projects, high-frequency applications, and, of course, is Heroes and Empires. Gafi Network will bring fully decentralized platform and web3 to around 40k users of H&E and millions of users in the cryptocurrency world.
  
  At this time, in the Kusama/Polkadot ecosystem, all the EVM compatible can be the same as Gafi Network at this time but with specialization of Gafi chain logic, there is no project nearly the same as Gafi according to [Dotmarketcap](https://dotmarketcap.com/ecosystem).

## Future Plans

Fortunately, we will integrate Heroes & Empires into Gafi Network first, allowing us to devote all of our resources (20 team members including marketing, QA, and QC) to expanding, using, and testing Gafi Network.

We will work with several top NFT Game projects and teams in Vietnam such as [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Imba Game](https://imba.co/), and [StarPunk](https://starpunk.io/) to deploy on Gafi Network.
