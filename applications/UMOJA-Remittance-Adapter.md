## Project Overview
UMOJA is a fintech remittance pilot focused on reducing the cost and friction of cross-border payments for African families and small merchants.

This proposal requests a Polkadot Fast-Grant to build a **technical proof-of-concept (PoC)** demonstrating how remittance settlement can be executed using Polkadot infrastructure.

The deliverable is strictly technical, open-source, and designed as a reference implementation.

---

## Problem Statement
Despite Polkadot’s strong interoperability capabilities, there is a lack of simple, developer-friendly reference implementations for real-world payment and remittance settlement.

Teams building payment infrastructure often lack:
- Clear examples of settlement flows
- Simple APIs for remittance tracking
- Lightweight, reusable components

---

## Proposed Solution
We propose an **open-source Polkadot Remittance Settlement Adapter** that:

- Accepts remittance instructions (sender, receiver, amount)
- Initiates settlement on a Polkadot-compatible parachain
- Tracks transaction status and fees
- Returns settlement confirmation

---

## Deliverables
- Adapter module (TypeScript)
- Polkadot.js integration example
- Testnet deployment
- Documentation & usage guide

---

## Timeline
**Week 1:** Architecture & setup  
**Week 2:** Settlement logic & tracking  
**Week 3:** Testing, docs, and demo  

---

## Open Source
All code will be released under a permissive open-source license.

---

## Funding Request
Requested: **$8,000 – $10,000**  
Acknowledgement: 50% DOT (vested), remainder in USDC.

## Ecosystem Impact
- Adds real-world payments reference code to Polkadot
- Supports fintech & remittance developers
- Demonstrates non-speculative blockchain utility
