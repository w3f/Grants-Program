# KEY Protocol - General Grant Application

- **Project Name:** KEY Protocol
- **Team Name:** KEY Protocol Team
- **Payment Address:** [Tu Wallet USDC/USDT] (Ethereum ERC20 or Polkadot Asset Hub)
- **Level:** 1 (Target: <$10k for initial module) or 2 (Target: up to $30k)

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

KEY Protocol is a **DePIN infrastructure for confidential offline verification**. We solve the "Privacy Paradox" in impact measurement: How to verify biometric and field data in disconnected areas without exposing sensitive user information on-chain.

We are applying to the Web3 Foundation to develop our core **Privacy Engine (Rust/WASM)**. This module uses Fuzzy Extractors to convert noisy biometric data (face/voice) into stable cryptographic keys directly in the device's RAM, enabling a Zero-Trust flow compatible with **Phala Network (TEEs)** and the Polkadot ecosystem.

### Project Details

We are building a bridge between physical reality in emerging markets (starting with Gran Chaco, Argentina) and the Polkadot ecosystem.

**The Tech Stack:**
- **Client-Side:** Rust compiled to WASM for offline biometric processing (Fuzzy Extractors).
- **Compute:** TEE integration (planning to use **Phala Network**) for confidential evidence validation.
- **Settlement:** ink! Smart Contracts (or EVM via peaq) for Identity and RWA minting.

**Architecture:**
1. **Capture:** Mobile device captures raw data (photo/audio).
2. **Obfuscation:** The Rust/WASM module generates a private key from the biometrics and encrypts the payload *before* it touches the disk.
3. **Storage:** Encrypted blobs sent to IPFS.
4. **Verification:** TEEs attest the validity of the data and sign the result on-chain.

### Ecosystem Fit

KEY Protocol brings a high-impact **Real World Asset (RWA)** use case to Polkadot: Social Impact Verification. By building our privacy primitives in Rust, we allow any Substrate-based chain (like peaq, Phala, or Astar) to integrate "Offline Verification" into their pallets.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

### Milestone 1 — Privacy Engine (Rust/WASM Module)
- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:** 2
- **Costs:** $15,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / GPLv3 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial on how to integrate the WASM module. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure cryptographic accuracy. |
| 1. | Rust Crate | We will create a Rust library implementing the **Fuzzy Extractor** logic (or adapting an existing library for WASM target). |
| 2. | WASM Build | Compilation of the Rust crate into a `.wasm` file optimized for mobile environments (no_std if possible). |
| 3. | Demo App | A simple CLI or Web interface demonstrating: Input Biometric -> Output Stable Key -> Encryption -> Decryption Success. |

### Milestone 2 — Phala Network / TEE Integration Design
- **Estimated duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:** 1
- **Costs:** $10,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Phat Contract | Development of a "Phat Contract" (Phala Network) blueprint that can receive the encrypted payload. |
| 2. | Integration Guide | A technical paper detailing the flow: Mobile -> IPFS -> Phala TEE -> Verification Result. |

## Future Plans
After completing this grant, we will deploy the full protocol on **peaq mainnet**, utilizing the developed Rust modules to secure the "Last Mile" verification for our pilot with 5 NGOs in Latin America.
