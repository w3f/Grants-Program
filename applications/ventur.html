<p>Ventur is focused on decentralizing business processes and services for professionals. Venturâ€™s initial goals are:</p>
<ol>
<li>To enable decentralized marketplaces for professional engagement, encompassing business-to-business engagement and employment contracts between businesses and individuals.</li>
<li>To enable assignment and evaluation of technical credentials.</li>
</ol>
<p>Venturâ€™s professional marketplaces will naturally enable additional use cases.  Having work engagements and their resolutions tracked on a parachain, will lend itself to treating records of completed work on Ventur as a trustless alternative to a company or individual contractor&#x27;s reputation.  Past work will serve as an immutable live CV for participants.  Enabling applications with functionality along the lines of LinkedIn to present work engagement data in a Professional Profile.</p>
<p>Furthermore, RFP (request for proposal) Providers requesting bids on Ventur will have the option to prefund their RFPs by placing funds into escrow to show Bidders that there are funds committed to the RFP.</p>
<p>Both Bidders and Providers will be incentivised to fulfill the off-chain obligations of their business contracts.  While on-chain logic can enforce one time payments and recurring payments, the delivery of deliverables will be incentivised through their public record on Ventur.</p>
<p>Bidders who do not deliver their work will have their failure to deliver recorded on Ventur.  Providers will be able to review past successes and failures as they evaluate whether to engage with bidders on new RFP bids.</p>
<p>Providers will be able to refine their bidding criteria and enforce requirements from account data not only on Ventur, but also from other parachains.  This lends itself to tracking cross chain credentials like technical certifications.  One possible example could be having an IT certification for knowledge in Validator management; this credential could be granted to an address as an NT-NFT, non-transferable NFT, on a given parachain.  Then, providers looking to engage bids for running a validator, could specify a requirement that only addresses in possession of a NT-NFT for Validator Operators can place bids.</p>

<p>Ventur will be built using the Substrate Framework.  It will exist as a parachain or parathread on the Polkadot Network and enable professional engagement for work related to each of the attached parachains and beyond.</p>

<p>The team at Popular Coding is excited by the promise of Web3 and is eager to help realize the promise of decentralization for use cases that can grow the ecosystem.  Our team has extensive experience working with Web2 technologies. We have engaged directly in RFP and bidding processes as consultants and have seen many companies through these processes as trusted advisors.  We have seen firsthand that there is much to be gained through a more transparent and open process, and we believe we have the right experience and skill sets to deliver on a Web3 implementation.</p>
<p>Beyond bidding, we have participated directly in the adoption and growth of the cloud industry, as  consultants helping customers move their first workloads into the cloud and as cloud engineers and architects for major cloud providers, helping provide prescriptive guidance and guide adoption across major corporations.  Weâ€™ve seen the importance of having certification processes and an available qualified workforce for companies to adopt new technologies and confidently accelerate their training and hiring efforts to grow in new fields.  We believe that the right training and certification processes tied into an RFP market can drive real value and accelerate growth for the Polkadot Kusama ecosystem.</p>

<p>An early stage MVP of the NT-NFT pallet has been developed and is located on <a href="https://github.com/Popular-Coding/nt-nft" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>In this initial batch of work, Ventur Network will not have any user-facing dapps implemented.  Development of marketplaces built upon this grant&#x27;s pallet functionality is planned but beyond the scope of this proposal.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">â€‹</a></h3>
<p>Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?</li>
</ul>
<p>From a functional perspective, Ventur fits in as a parachain.</p>
<p>Ventur focuses on supporting business and professional engagement processes for the DotSama ecosystem.  Specifically, Ventur will initially support processes for RFP creation, bidding, and acceptance.  There will also be functionality for automating payment schedules for RFP contracts.</p>
<p>These functions have the potential to enable a decentralized marketplace for work within the DotSama ecosystem.  Furthermore, integration with other parachains through xcmp will enable RFPs to reference attributes from other chains as qualifications to bid on an RFP, as well as allowing buyers to create RFPs with payment escrow in tokens native to other parachains.</p>
<p>Additionally, histories of successfully paying out RFPs and successfully fulfilling bids for work on the Ventur network could serve as trustless reputations for companies and individual professionals in the ecosystem.  Allowing newcomers to confidently engage companies and workers with documented histories or even living resumes on Ventur.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp&#x27;s user base, yourself)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The target audience for Ventur from an end user perspective includes  businesses and individual professionals.</p>
<p>But more directly, Ventur will have a direct target audience of dapp developers.  Dapps can be built on top of Ventur to enable marketplaces for different types of work, ranging from GitHub bounties to NFT creation marketplaces and even marketplaces for off-chain work and fulfillment.
Developers will also be able to look at the network history to deliver web apps that display trends and analytics for the marketplaces and that rank, categorize, and summarize buyer and bidder histories.</p>
<ul>
<li>What need(s) does your project meet?</li>
</ul>
<p>Connecting Businesses and Professionals with a work and bid marketplace and providing tools for one-off contracts and long-term engagement.</p>
<p>Beyond providing a decentralized and transparent marketplace for professional engagement, Ventur will also be able to serve as a record of completed work, in effect allowing past work to serve as a living on-chain resume for professionals.  And Non-Transferable NFTs will enable technical certification and professional and academic credentials to be represented and tied to on-chain entities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>If so, how is your project different?</li>
<li>If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are a few grant proposals which have worked to implement Auctions on Substrate.
While our RFP process will have similarities to an auction process, allowing for bids and providing mechanisms for eventual winner selection. It will differ in having mechanisms for requesters to approve bids after manual review and qualification options for automatically limiting bids to members of predefined collectives and holders of particular NT-NFTs (which can serve as technical certifications).  There will also need to be options to reopen bidding should an approved bidder not accept their selection.</p>
<p>There have been multiple implementations of NFT pallets for Substrate.  As the name suggests, our Non-Transferrable NFT pallet would be differentiated from existing implementations by enabling NFTs that are soulbound to a specific account, <a href="https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html?external=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">there has been some popular writing on the topic of soulbound nfts</a>.  To prevent such NFTs from being spammed onto accounts in an unsolicited manner, the NT-NFT pallet would require an acceptance by the NT-NFT recipients to finish the minting process.  NT-NFTs will also provide an option for expiry.</p>
<p>From a broad perspective, the RFP portion of this project could be considered similar to GitCoin.  And a GitHub bounty functionality as well as crowdsourced grant funding functionality are certainly use cases that we envision Ventur supporting.  However, Ventur intends to more broadly support bids and engagement outside the realm of code development and delivery.  Additionally, we would like to see Ventur support not just bidding and bounty processes but also collective enablement and benefit procurement for freelancers, and fundamental business processes like payroll automation.</p>

<p><strong>How did you hear about the Grants Program?</strong><br>
<!-- -->Web3 Foundation Website and personal recommendation.</p>
<p>Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn&#x27;t part of it already, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Work you have already done.<br>
<!-- -->This would be our first grant in the Web3 ecosystem.  We have created an MVP of the NT-NFT module defined as a part of our deliverables and would further refine and integrate it as part of this grantâ€™s work.</li>
<li>If there are any other teams who have already contributed (financially) to the project.<br>
<!-- -->No teams have contributed financially to our project, but we did receive some prize money for placing third in the <a href="https://polkadot-na.devpost.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot Hackathon 2022</a>â€™s NFT category for our work conceptualizing the NT-NFT module.</li>
