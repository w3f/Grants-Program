# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Polka Genesis
* **Proposer:** n8wb
* **Payment Address:** 1JRYo1iw32TvwydE2cqquUQ3yuc4a1UsbT

## Project Description :page_facing_up: 
Whiteblock Genesis is a powerful and versatile tool for the testing of distributed systems in real world conditions. Integrating Polkadot into the Genesis platform will allow for a significant increase in the ability for developers to test the impact of their changes. Instead of having to wait weeks or even months for members of a testnet to update to a change, developers can test the impact immediately and get results in just a few hours. This will allow for Polkadot developers to quickly identify issues and correct them before releasing to production. We are excited for the opportunity to assist in the growth of Polkadot, and want to become more involved in the Polkadot developer ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

* **Total Estimated Duration:** 2 months
* **Total Costs:** 5.40 BTC

### Discovery
We will draft a plan of the tests that would provide the most value for the Polkadot development community.

* **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks
* **Costs:** \~1.40 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Test Plan | A test definition which is runnable on the Whiteblock Platform |  


### Integration

Here we will integrate Polkadot into the Whiteblock Genesis platform. This will allow for Polkadot developers to be able to determine the impact of their changes on the client. Some examples of tests include simple consensus tests, partition tolerance testing, load testing under non-idealistic conditions (i.e., network impairments between the nodes), and blockchain interoperability tests. 

* **Estimated Duration:** 6 weeks
* **Costs:** \~3.00 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Test Definition File(s) | A test definition which is runnable on the Whiteblock Platform |
| 2. | Supporting Helpers | Any helpers which are needed to facilitate the proper execution of tests |
| 3. | Tutorial Video | A video giving a brief introduction on how to test Polkadot on the platform |
| 4. | Testing Tutorial | A simple tutorial to help interested parties to test Polkadot on the Whiteblock platform |

### Availability/Support
Polkadot developers will have access to the Genesis platform, so that they may use the integrated test suite on the platform. 

* **Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks
* **Costs:** \~1.00 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 1. | Platform Access | Developers will be given access to the platform, for up to \~1460 hours of testing |
| 2. | Onboarding Support | We will assist in the onboarding of developers, helping them get started |
