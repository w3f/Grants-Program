## Project OverviewðŸ“„

### Overview

**Tagline -** ChessOnChain â€“ The Multi-Chain Chess Gaming Network and NFT Economy.
**Brief Introduction**: 
ChessOnChain seeks to create a chain agnostic platform for chess Gaming. Being an robust Playground around several ecosystems creating a multi-chain economy for On-chain gaming, ChessOnChain aims to  store all game and gamer data on substrate   layer one  in the future as we slowly introduce gamers to blockchain  storage.

Undergoing development for over 3 years with a dedicated team focused on expanding the on-chain gaming experience to every chain.
since our Beta testing release we have collaborated with various Polkadot  communities and initiatives on various events raising in-game interactions to over 1000 weekly active users, over 2,000 sign ups for our Polkadot events (ChessJAM tournaments, 1,000 Leaderboard Bounty and up coming ChessJAM tournaments 2.0) Distributed over 100 common Chess Piece NFTs via Unique network for which we were awarded the [Unique Network code craft grant](https://unique.network/blog/introducing-the-latest-codecraft-project-chessonchain-the-codecraft-fair/) 


we have secured various valuable partnership both within the Polkadot community and beyond along with prospect partners we are reaching out to and would reach out to, you can find a comprehensive list [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16Ww-WwtDyC2YNtKLqNLsSuqILMi8DVDrReHxbf5RA9s) 
### **Project Description:**

ChessOnChain is a decentralized, multi-chain chess gaming platform that enables players to compete, earn rewards, and own in-game assets as NFTs. ChessOnChain provides a full web3 chess infrastructure where players can mint **Proof of Gaming NFTs** representing game states, stake assets, and participate in tournaments with distribution.

ChessOnchain integrates into the Polkadot ecosystem through:
- allowing users to authenticate with Talisman wallet, Novawallet and subwallet
- NFT authorization and Checkmate NFT Minting on Unique Network (an NFT augmented Parachain on Polkadot) 
- Chess in-game Skins listed on Polkadot and parachain supported Market places
- Scaling to Support more parachains with this proposal  
### Project Details

### **Mockups & UI Designs:**

- The ChessOnChain UI Mockup can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/bIhfSIzNKEjqBGHH9rXcwy/Chessonchain?node-id=206-3859&t=mXwHr0mentJesfXE-1) 
### **Core Components & Architecture:**

- **NFT & Gaming Economy**: [On-chain Proof of Gaming NFTs](https://unqnft.io/unique/collection/954), these are NFTs that are minted at the end of a game to the winner's client chain in the case of Polkadot, Unique Network, they contain in the metadata of the game properties, and is represented with the final board state, The image can be opinionated based on the NFT metadata and in the future the 
- **Challenge and game invite mechanism** : Allows users to challenge other users and share invite links to games. 
- **Multi-chain support** : Allow users to sign in with any familiar chain supported wallet cutting across and supporting over 200+ wallets

### **What ChessOnChain is NOT**
- It **does not require custodial wallets**â€”users fully control their chess NFTs and assets.

## **Ecosystem Fit**

### **How ChessOnChain Fits into the Polkadot / Substrate / Kusama Landscape:**

- **NFT & Web3 Gaming Economy**: ChessOnChain NFTs represent unique game states and can be staked, auctioned, or burned for rewards.

### **Target Audience:**

- **Parachains & DeFi Protocols**: Interested in integrating gaming incentives and NFT collateralization.
- **Blockchain Gamers & Chess Enthusiasts**: Seeking an open, fair, regardless of Blockchain ecosystem orientation.
- **Tournament Organizers**: Creating decentralized chess tournaments with on-chain prize pools.

### **What Needs Does ChessOnChain Meet?**

- **Eliminates Centralized Chess Control**: Web2 chess platforms lacks the abundant level of Permissionless access. ChessOnChain offers decentralized, transparent governance.
- **Creates a Rewarding Chess Economy**: Players earn from tournaments, NFT sales.
- **Enables Multi-Chain Chess Matches**: Unlike existing chess apps, ChessOnChain operates across multiple chains enabling users from various Chain to interact in games and events on ChessOnChain
### **How We Identified These Needs:**

- **Case Study: FIDE Chess Rankings & Web2 Limitations**: The current system lacks transparency and is prone to arbitrary rating changes.
- **Community Discussions**: Many chess players in Web3 complain about cheating, lack of monetization, and centralized bans (e.g., in Lichess/Chess.com).
- **Growing Web3 Gaming Adoption**: NFT-based games like Axie Infinity and Treasure DAO prove on-chain gaming demand is increasing.
- **NFTs and Digital ownership**: The rise of NFTs as the future of digital interactions and assets ownership is a paradigm that is eluding most of the traditional gaming ecosystem in the most innovative way rather than mere price speculation 

### **Are There Similar Projects in Polkadot / Kusama?**

- **No direct competitors** offer **fully on-chain chess mechanics with NFT-based rewards and multi-chain support**.
- **Chess platforms like Lichess and Chess.com are centralized** and do not provide player-owned assets or Web3 incentives.
- **Existing blockchain games focus on speculative NFTs** rather than decentralized gameplay.

### **Are There Similar Projects in Other Ecosystems?**

- **Immortal Game (Ethereum)**: Uses NFTs but is fully centralized.
- **OnChain Chess (EVM chains)**: Limited to Solidity-based smart contracts, lacks **multi-chain and Polkadot integration**.
- **Horizonâ€™s Skyweaver (Polygon)**: Focuses on card games, showing the demand for Web3 strategy games.
- Anichess : even recently brought Magnus carlsen to play web3 chess .
