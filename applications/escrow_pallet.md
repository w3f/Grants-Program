## Project Overview 


### Overview

- We will build an Escrow pallet.
- The Escrow pallet will help the web3 communities to release funds easier.
- I will use substrate framework to build this pallet.
- My team is happy to create this project because they want to build something for the community.

### Project Details

We aim to build a Escrow pallet which will help communities to release funds easier to devs/teams.
I would like to explain the purpose of the project with a real example.
A developer wants to fix/develop a bug/feature.
He requested some funds and his proposal got approved.
Both of the parties (for ex: web3 community and contributor) sign an Escrow contract by defining the Web3 community address, the contributor address, the amount, the expiry date, and “take action days”.
“Take action days” would be some supplement time after the contract has ended for the Web3 to test/check if the bug/feature has been delivered correctly.
Once the contract is signed the Web3 funds will be locked into another address.
During the take action days Web3 can decide to:
1-Send the funds manually to the contributor 
2-Withdraw the funds because nothing was delivered
3-Do not take any action during the “take action days” and when these additive days are expired the contributor can withdraw the funds by himself. (This option would reduce the releasing fund steps by giving additional work to the contributor)

### Ecosystem Fit

- Substrate learners would have an Escrow pallet as example.
- Web3 companies who would like to release funds in a very easy way.

### Team's experience

Hello, my name is Elio. I have a master's degree in computer science and I have more than 6 years experience as a professional software developer in Android/Java developer in the market. I have been deeply fascinated by blockchain and discovered Substrate. I have spent 1+ year learning/contributing to Rust/Substrate.
I am a contributor to the Substrate recipes repo,  taking it upon myself to upgrading Substrate “Kitchen Node” Recipes from v1 to v2, which took 5-6 months working in my spare time.


Hello, my name is Gerti. Over the last 5 years, I've been continuously working towards achieving clients' business goals through the application of IT technology. The collaborations I've had working in a few industries brought to life numerous products with an audience of thousands and even millions of users. The secret behind this success was creating an intuitive, visually attractive application customized to the needs of the target clientele.
In addition to the substantial experience working as a Java Enterprise, I've also gained a Master's Degree in Computer Science that has equipped me with a strong knowledge of the newest tools and technologies to create flawless products your clients will enjoy.
The last months I have been curious about Substrate/Rust, and I am learning it on my spare time.

## Future Plans

- In the future we may have several senders instead of one and we can also do that during "take action days" if 51% of senders do not want to release funding then the funds can be withdrawn.
