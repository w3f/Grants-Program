- **Team Name:** TwinP
- **Payment Address:** 0xd042e53e22e9f941ceba02f4adb9d1b32ef43675
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1

## Project Overview


### Overview

- We will build a decentralized invoice system.
- Business and clients can pay and create invoices.
- Keep track of create/pay invoices.
- The system can be used by B2B, B2C, C2C.

### Project Details

We aim to build a decentralized invoice system that will help businesses/clients create/pay bills for given services.
We will use substrate node template to build our pallet.

Pallet name: InvoicePallet

Methods:

1- create_invoice(amount, from  // It is optional, reason (msg is option), to) 
-> This method will create an invoice that should be paid.

2- show_all_invoices(from)
-> This method will show: Date, from, to, amount and status. Status can be to be Awaiting Payment/Payed

3- pay_invoice(to)
-> send the amount to the receiver and change the status of invoice from Awaiting Payment to Payed

A similar product has been made by Request Network. They do have some products and one of them is similar 
to the one I would like to build: https://create.request.network/
They have used ethereum and solidity and we are gonna use substrate and rust.


### Ecosystem Fit

- Businesses and clients who would like to create and pay invoices.

### Team's experience

Hello, my name is Elio. I have a master's degree in computer science and I have more than 6 years of experience as a professional software developer in the Android/Java developer in the market. I have been deeply fascinated by blockchain and discovered Substrate. I have spent 1+ year learning/contributing to Rust/Substrate.I am a contributor to the Substrate recipes repo,  taking it upon myself to upgrade Substrate “Kitchen Node” Recipes from v1 to v2, which took 5-6 months working in my spare time.

Hello, my name is Gerti. Over the last 5 years, I've been continuously working towards achieving clients' business goals through the application of IT technology. The collaborations I've had working in a few industries brought to life numerous products with an audience of thousands and even millions of users. The secret behind this success was creating an intuitive, visually attractive application customized to the needs of the target clientele.In addition to the substantial experience working as a Java Enterprise, I've also gained a Master's Degree in Computer Science that has equipped me with a strong knowledge of the newest tools and technologies to create flawless products your clients will enjoy.For the last few years, I have been curious about Substrate/Rust, and I am learning it in my spare time.
