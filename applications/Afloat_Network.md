## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

Afloat Network is a Platform for 3D content creation and distribution. 
Providing infrastructure for the current 3D industry today and the future Web3.

- The platform connects Creator, Project and Collector.
Creating a trustless marketplace, connecting Creators assets to Projects in high demand. Bringing the audience closer to the stories and let Collectors own their favourite assets.

- Contributing with help building out the 3D side of Substrate/Polkadot by bringing Universal Scene Description OpenUSD to Substrate.

- About two years ago, this idea came to me and gradually took shape as I worked in Denmark. Towards the end of the year, significant changes was made in the company where I was working, and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to relocate in Andorra, and establish the company there. Im working full time on developing this project.

### Project Details
[afloat.network](https://afloat.network/)  
[Universal Scene Description](https://openusd.org/) Is refered to as OpenUSD or USD  

**Defining sectors**  
- Creator: Character artist, Environment artist, Layout arist, Rigger, Shading/Material, Lighting, Animator and Simulation
- Project: Film, Games, Animation, VFX and future Web3(any project utilising 3D assets)
- Collector: Audience can collect 3D assets or Project tokens that they believe in.

**Sectors activity**  
- Creator can explore and connect with project and develop their 3D Assets to be used in Projects.  
- Project can then use the 3D assets for their project and pay with revenue of the finished project.  
- Collector is able to own their favorite asset and connect with creators and projects.  
    
### Technology Stack  
  
**Web Application**
- `React` `Javascript`
   
**Platform Application**
- `Swift` `SwiftUI` `ImGUI` `OpenUSD` `MaterialX`
  
**Blockchain**
- `Rust` `Substrate` `IPFS` `ZKP` 
  
### AFL FRAME - WIP
  
- `Pallet_OpenUSD` Manage and create `NFTUSD` The asset metadata is used to define the smart contract. Any changes made to the smart contract will be reflected in the metadata of the asset, so changes in assets can always be traced back to the creator. The 3D files are stored with `IPFS`
    
- `Pallet_Project` Manage and create `Project` each project has their own token that they can use to pay for the assets. Project token will reflect the value of the project.

### UI Components

Dashboard is composed of modular widgets that are interactable from the OS desktop, tablet, and mobile

Afloat is not the Metaverse, but rather a hub for creators and projects to come to life.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Pallets**

Afloat applies the categories below:

- OpenUSD
- Project

### Project Uniqueness

- We aim to revolutionize how we create, colloaborate and engage with 3D content.  
Connecting people to tell interactive stories.

### Target Audience

- Creators - 3D Artist of any specilazation
- Projects - Film, Games, Animation and Web3 Experiences
- Entertainment audience
- Learning

### Problem Addressed

- Decentralising the way we create 3D Projects
- Creator getting paid of the revenue of the Project, minimizing barrier of entry both for Creators and Projects
- 3D Assets can always be traced back to the Creator
- Collector is able to own their favorite asset

| 0e. | Article | We will publish an **article** that goes through the design decisions behind afloat platform |
| 5. | Library: Afloat Platform | We will deliver a public Figma design prototype |


## Future Plans

Short term: 
- Once the team is established we will build out the initial version of Afloat
![roadmap](https://github.com/Afloat-Network/Grants-Program/assets/114810952/570bfcdc-32fa-4e5d-b123-25d7368c214c)
- We want to extend the Pallet_OpenUSD to support Software used to create the asset.

Long-term: 
- We are here to develop a infinte Project. We will maintain, iterate and update all aspects of this project.
- We envision a physical location of afloat where we can collaborate with finished projects to be exhibited and experienced. This will also be a space where people can come together to collaborate, share knowledge and participate in events.
- End-user platform where finished projects can live and be experienced.
- Collector that own an asset can use it for playing in Metaverse.
