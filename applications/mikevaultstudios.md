# MikeVaultStudios - DeFi Automation Suite

- **Team Name:** MikeVaultStudios
- **Payment Details:**
  - **DOT**: TBD (to be provided after KYC)
  - **Payment**: TBD (USDC on Polkadot AssetHub)
- **Level:** 1

## Project Overview

### Overview

MikeVaultStudios is developing an advanced DeFi automation suite consisting of two primary tools: an Ethereum-based Sniper Bot and a Layer 2 Gas Saver contract. These tools aim to provide users with competitive advantages in token launches and significant cost savings on Layer 2 networks.

**Sniper Bot**: An automated trading bot designed to execute rapid token purchases during new token launches on decentralized exchanges (DEX). The bot monitors mempool activity, identifies profitable opportunities, and executes transactions with optimal gas pricing to secure early positions in promising tokens.

**L2 Saver Contracts**: Smart contracts deployed on Layer 2 networks that optimize transaction batching and gas consumption, reducing transaction costs by up to 70% for frequent DeFi users.

**Integration with Polkadot Ecosystem**: While our initial deployment focuses on Ethereum and EVM-compatible chains, we are exploring integration with Polkadot's ecosystem through:
- Cross-chain bridges to enable Polkadot users to access Ethereum DeFi opportunities
- Potential deployment of similar automation tools on Polkadot parachains
- Leveraging Polkadot's interoperability to create unified DeFi automation across multiple chains

**Team Interest**: Our team is passionate about democratizing access to DeFi tools that were previously available only to institutional players. We believe in building open-source infrastructure that benefits the entire Web3 community.

### Project Details

**Technology Stack:**
- Solidity for smart contracts
- Web3.js/Ethers.js for blockchain interactions
- Node.js for bot infrastructure
- Remix IDE for development and testing
- TypeScript for type-safe development

**Core Components:**

1. **Sniper Bot Regular**: 
   - Mempool monitoring
   - Gas price optimization
   - Front-running protection
   - Multi-DEX support (Uniswap V2/V3)
   - Configurable slippage and gas limits

2. **L2 Saver Contracts**:
   - Transaction batching
   - Gas optimization algorithms
   - Support for multiple L2 networks
   - User-friendly interface

**Current Development Status:**
- Sniper Bot: Compiled and ready for deployment on Ethereum Sepolia testnet
- L2 Saver: Developed in separate Remix workspace, tested successfully
- Repository: https://github.com/mikej420710666-UX

**Limitations:**
- Initial version focuses on EVM-compatible chains
- Requires active monitoring during high-volatility periods
- Not a financial advisory tool

### Ecosystem Fit

**Position in Ecosystem:**
Our project bridges Ethereum DeFi tools with the Polkadot ecosystem, enabling cross-chain DeFi automation. As Polkadot continues to grow its DeFi presence, tools like ours become essential for users wanting to participate across multiple ecosystems.

**Target Audience:**
- DeFi traders and enthusiasts
- Cross-chain protocol developers
- Parachain projects building DeFi applications
- Individual users seeking to optimize transaction costs

**Needs Addressed:**
- High gas costs on Layer 1 and Layer 2 networks
- Need for automated, reliable trading tools
- Cross-chain DeFi participation barriers

**Similar Projects:**
While various trading bots exist in the Ethereum ecosystem, few focus on cross-chain integration with Polkadot. Our unique approach combines proven automation techniques with Polkadot's interoperability features.
