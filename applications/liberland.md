### Introduction:

Liberland is a country established in 2015 ,on a noman’s land( _terranullius_ ) between   
Croatia and Serbia. Liberland’s founders are blockchain and liberty enthusiasts.     
Liberland’s State project could be summarized by two concepts: Minimal state and    
distributive governance.
        
Using substrate,we want to build and enable all e-government services to be available   
to our citizens using our substrate-based blockchain.
     
While working on establishing the physical State in the designated area, Liberland  
is building a virtual representation of that area in its own Metaverse. The governance  
of this “virtual Liberland” shall become the first use case for our system. The Metaverse is   
being built as we speak(World.liberland.org) and the urgency of having the blockchain
built as soon as possible grows with each milestone on that project.


### Scope of the Project:

As of writing this we at liberland currently have over 660k(662329) signed up users. We aim       
to utilize our substrate-base "liberland-chain" to provide e-services for these users.   


# Requested funding   
We request a total amount of 50 000 USD, payable in BTC for all the milestones. Our goal is also to become part of  
substrate's builders program in order to get technical support and guidance from Parity.


#### Liberland Blockchain

##### Backend and Frontend

The scope of this project is both our front-end, or more properly said, a set of    
frontends with which Liberlanders will be able to interact; and the backend, including    
the Substrate nodes and the databases interacting with the blockchain. In the advanced    
phases of the project, we will   
create API connections with the Metaverse and its specific    
functions and with other extrinsic services.    


##### Liberland Merit (LLM)

We name our currency and main on-chain token to Liberland Merit (LLM), signifying 
the connection between money and real-life value. LLM will be the governance token
of our blockchain and of Liberland itself. As the blockchain will enable Smart 
Contracts, there will be other tokens, both fungible and non-fungible.
The tokennomics of LLM will be a hard cap of 70 million being distributed over 
a fixed amount of LLM will be minted over a timeframe of 48 years, allowing inflation 
to be fixed (being able to pre calculate future inflation percentages) and controlled over time.  

Please see the details here:

SF0LPKro/edit#gid=


##### Citizenship

Citizenship and e-residency user statuses and roles shall be held on-chain and
therefore validated along with other transactions. We will implement the identity pallet   
and adapt it to Liberland’s legal system.     

##### Congress

The Congress is a customized pallet, using delegated voting functionality using the
underlaying Democracy pallet. By utilizing this technology we are creating a true
representative democracy. Representative democracy is used to _enact_ laws and other 
regulations, both on-chain (as governance) and o-chain (for the state).  
In the Assembly elections, a Citizen votes _with their tokens_ , producing a   
proof-of-stake-like meritocracy in Liberland’s politics. 
Voters will be allowed to rethink their vote, even mid-term. They can rearrange the  
LLM allotted to the Congressmen based on their performance.   

##### Executive
Our Executive is a fork of modern parachain council’s such as Polkadot’s Council, though   
heavily modified. It is composed of four ministers led by one prime minister. The powers    
of the Executive are to govern directly on-chain within the limits of Congress’s laws   
and off-chain as well in the metaverse and later the real-life state.   



##### Treasury
One of the standing values that Liberland has is that all taxes are paid voluntarily  
by the citizens of Liberland. We fork Polkadot’s Treasury and implement it as a   
multisig wallet held by the on-chain politicians of Liberland. Like Polkadot’s  
Treasury, we will handle funding proposals, mainly initiated by the Executive and the Congress.
To handle day-to-day expenses, the Treasury will be fuelled by transaction fees   
and also by “real estate fees” when we are able to launch our Metaverse.



##### Registers

We will build NFT-fuelled registers of many kinds of entities, starting with virtual real estate for our Metaverse. 
Next will be registers for persons and companies. These registers will be connected to front-end interfaces.

##### Judiciary

We intend to form an on-chain judiciary system, working to resolve conflicts both   
on-chain and in Liberland. Information about our Judiciary system can be found here:

### Every milestone also includes:

#### License:  
We will release all code under the MIT license, in order to give everyone access to our chain and enable developers to build applications    
with the liberland blockchain.   
Read more about MIT license here:   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

#### Documentation for all deliverable's  
Documentation is something we take very seriously and our goal is to have the entire code base documented   
with both inline code comments and how-to guides, teaching users how to easiely use the tools that we provide.

#### Testing   
We require all our functionality to have stable tests and benchmarking in order to verify high code quality. Our CI is configured to 
execute all the tests that we have written and shut down pull requests that do not live up to our criteria.   

#### Generic Linux x86 and Docker deployment files
With every milestone we will provide automated deployed files and pre-compiled binaries so that new user can  
easily deploy and run liberland nodes.


## Releases   
All releases will come with docker images and deployment files in order to make it as easy possible for   
users to run our blockchain. We will publish an article about every release we do in order to showcase what we worked on  
and also allow more people to interact with liberland's blockchain.   


## Timeline and Milestones :nut_and_bolt:   

All milestones are included in the total funding, that can be found in the Requested funding section above.



### Milestone 1: Basic blockchain

A basic mainnet blockchain based on Substrate. This is to a large extent already  
built thanks to earlier efforts, but the project must be finished and deployed.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License |  MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline code documentation as well as user guides that shows how people can interact with our pallets and chain |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | We will have test files for all mayor functions, more about our testing procedure can be found under the testing section  |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfiles that can be used to run our node and also test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish a detailed article, walking a user through all functionality and features.)
| 1. | Transaction module | We will create a Substrate module that will enable users to send and recieve the on-chain token LLM |  
| 2. | Nominated Proof of stake consensus | We are shipping with nominated proof of stake consensus instead of Proof of Authority in order to promote decentralization and motivate user to run validators |  
| 3. | Staking module | We will create a staking module that will allow users to stake their tokens and earn rewards|  
| 4. | Active testnet | We will launch and host our first release testnet  |  
| 5. | User Roles | We will create a substrate module that allows users to have roles/on-chain idenities | 

**Deadline: Q2 2022**


#### Output

We have a simple, functioning blockchain. We will begin with a marketing campaign
and a funding/investor-seekingcampaign. We will give their work some publicity,and
we will also start airdropping their wages.

##### Delivery:   
We will deliver a working blockchain under the MIT license that can be used by anyone and will be avaliable here:
https://github.com/liberland_node


##### Price per milestone:   
This milestone is included in the full-price.

##### Technical information:    
Our team will develop our first iteration of a working testnet style network using. Complete with custom    
pallet's that allow the functionality to send and 
recieve tokens, configure user roles, custom voting functionality: allowing the citizen to vote on petition using the underlaying democracy pallet.
After internal discussion we also decided not to go with the Proof of Authority consense and went   
with a polkadot inspired Nominated Proof of stake consensus 
algorithm, utilizing the babe pallet for block production.
Because Liberland's blockchain is hosting a digital nation state, we want to allow users to have roles. So all e-citizens have the 
e-citizens role, all assembly members have the assembly role and so on. Different roles will allow   
for different privledged functionality. Such as being able to vote and propose laws.


#### Milestone Frontend

**Deadline: Q2 2022**

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License |  MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline code documentation as well as user guides that shows how people can interact with our pallets and chain |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | We will have test files for all mayor functions, more about our testing procedure can be found under the testing section  |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfiles that can be used to run our node and also test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish a detailed article, walking a user through all functionality and features.)
| 1.  | Frontend application | We will our frontend ready to be  |  create a Substrate module that will enable users to send and recieve the on-chain token LLMvgft
|  2. | User onboarding                 |      We will onboard our current userbase of citizen's to our Frontend using a browser based wallet, allowing them to interact with the liberland blockchain       |
| 3. | Validator search | our frontend will allow the functionality to view and interact with running on-chain validators |
```

#### Optional

Provided there is developmenttime, work can begin on a Liberand Android app,
followed by an iOS app.

Make it a wallet application; inspirations: Trust Wallet, Mycelium, Blue Wallet;
Phantom Wallet (for the staking features; that one is not yet mobile).


Basic functionality for starters-send, receive, show, stake,see your stake,nominate
stake to yourself or another validator, claim rewards.

##### Output

We will now have a functioning and marketable frontend. Our e-residents will login  
from their PCs and maybe from their smartphone. Staking will become easy and  
transparent,enabling us to market it as a source of passive income and a usecasefor
our token.


##### Delivery:   
We will deliver an internet facing frontend that can interact with our blockchain. This     
frontend will be programmed in angular js and interact with our    
backend blockchain using our chains websocket that is listening for active websocket connections.  
The public frontend will allow all users to interact with the liberland blockchain, being able to transact, vote and stake tokens.

##### Price per milestone:   
This milestone is included in the full-price.

##### Technical information:    
The frontend is written in angular js and utilizes substrate's built in listening websocket. Thanks to this functionality our frontend  
can communicate and call pallet functions. We are implementing the frontend to communicate with both the websocket of the chain as well as  
polkadot.js browser plugin wallet. Allowing anyone to use our frontend that has a working browser.


### Milestone: State Governance

**Deadline: Q3 2022**

We split the governance by State powers (Montesquieu: Legislative, Executive, Judicial), and    
each power has a different priority. The highest priority is assigned to the Legislative Branch.  
The reason for that is that the Legislative Branch is the most citizen-facing. We    
need our citizens and supporters to find themselves in our system - ASAP. This is    
why we have a burning need to implement the Legislative Branch first, far ahead of all the others.    

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License |  MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline code documentation as well as user guides that shows how people can interact with our pallets and chain |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | We will have test files for all mayor functions, more about our testing procedure can be found under the testing section  |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfiles that can be used to run our node and also test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish a detailed article, walking a user through all functionality and features.)
| 1. | Voting module | We will create a Substrate module that will enable users to vote and take an active part in voting in Liberland's judicial system |  
| 2. | Law module | We will create a substrate module that allows users to create and vote for removal of laws | 


The voting and the law module will enable the following functionality: 

The Legislative Branch also can work on its own without the other branches.    

##### Basic representative democracy

```
● running full elections into the Congressional Assembly, our parliament;
● onboarding new Representatives (elected ocials);
● ending their term when the election cycle is over;
● work with a special algorithm that allocates votes(you vote with your Staked
LLM);
● Representatives can vote in the Prime Minister and Ministers;
● they can fire the Prime Minister or Ministers.
```

##### Basic legislative process

```
● Congress users can propose laws;
● They can vote for these laws with the LLM they had been voted in during the   
elections (the popular political power) + their LLM;   
● Laws can be accepted or rejected by the Assembly; and
● Accepted Laws are written into the Blockchain and shown in the front end.
```
##### Basic Public Veto (direct democracy)

```
● Citizens can propose the(binding,unlike with petitions)motion for the removal  
of a Law;
● they can vote for it, one citizen, one vote ; and
● the VetoProposal(referendum) stays open until 50 percent plus one citizen vote
yea or nay.   
```

##### Delivery:   
Liberland's blockchain will be released with the mentioned features on our public    
liberland_node repository on github. This release will focus mostly on   
expanding voting functionality introducing anyone to propose and vote on laws. 

##### Price per milestone:   
This milestone is included in the full-price.

##### Technical information:    
By utilizing pallet-democracy from Parity, we will implement custom functionality to allow our users  
to vote on different referendum and proposals depending on a users role, a user has   
can be a regular user without roles, e-residence or a citizen. Then we have assembly members, an assembly member is either a e-residence  
or a citizen that also has more privledges and is allowed to have more of an authority when voting. If you are familiar with unix based operating system  
you can see the Assembly member as a Linux or a BSD user that's added to the "staff" group.  
Our frontend will be able to query these custom pallets for processing highlevel voting functionality   
in order to give the end-user a more smoother experience.


#### Smart Contracts

**Deadline: Q3 2022**

The final task in the Q4 to Q1 scope is to prepare the Smart Contract pallet.This pallet 
will enable others to write and run smart contracts,enabling functionality to
Ethereumor BSC-DEXes and DAPPs. We do not expect this tobe _completely_ finished  
before the end of Q4, but significant work should already be done by then.  
 
| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License |  MIT |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline code documentation as well as user guides that shows how people can interact with our pallets and chain |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | We will have test files for all mayor functions, more about our testing procedure can be found under the testing section  |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfiles that can be used to run our node and also test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Article | We will publish a detailed article, walking a user through all functionality and features.)
| 1. | Smart contract module | We will create a Substrate module that will enable developers to create decentralized application using !ink smart contracts |  
| 2. | Smart contract dex | We will create a simple decentralized exchange to showcase functionality of our smart contract module | 
| 3. | Public blockchain explorer | we will release a public blockchain explorer where our users can see all transactions in real time |
| 4. | On-chain smart contract assets | We will use our smart contract functionality to create on-chain assets such as NFT's | 


On-chain smart contracts assets:

#### Citizenship NFT

This will be the first Smart Contract we create on our new pallet.The purpose will be
to represent the citizenship of every citizen.

Citizenship token will contain

```
● a picture of the citizenship ID;
● link to the owner's Liberland account(this will be the holder of that account,a  
citizen will be for the system this token!)
```

```
● the number of LLM staked into the citizenship;
● the history of this particular citizenship token,i.e.who was the previous holder
and holders of this NFT, creating a potentially "collectable" NFT.
```


##### Output

We will be able to build smart contracts on our chain, which will create attractivity and 
use cases, which will also enable us to take our governance to the next level. We will be 
able to setup more government processes as smartcontracts. We will provide every 
citizen with their tokenized citizenship right in their wallet.  


##### Delivery:   
The public release of this be able for everyone to download and use from our public liberland_node github.   

##### Technical information:    
This release will add functionality for users to run and interact with smart contracts. We will utilize substrate's own smart contract   
framework "!ink". Liberland has gained a lot traction and interest since our start in 2015. Thanks to our larger userbase we expect to have a larger amount.  

##### Price per milestone:   
This milestone is included in the full-price.

#### Current Development Status

There have been about 7 full months of development spent on the project by various   
developers outside of the current team.

Th ecurrent node implementation of Liberland’s blockchain has started and we have a   
early beta version that you can find and download here:     
https://github.com/liberland/liberland_node








## Ecosystem Fit:

Liberland seeks to bring substrate up to a new level,running a non-chain Metaverse as
well as an entire sovereign country on it.  

The blockchain world and especially the Substrate/Polkadot environment is a perfect 
fit for running public administration,as governments are ledgers.They must be secure  
and transparent, public blockchains provide that.

States,however, tend to use,if any,private blockchains.This must *change* and we
propose to become the pioneers of this change.   

This is following along with polkadot’s future vision of hosting decentralized nation
states:    

https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-pdk#digital-nation-states


As builders for the infrastructure to support the digitization of a country, we want to utilize  
the formance and security of the Rust programming. 
Parity’s vision for substrate aligns with our vision of providing e-services for our citizens.



## The Future

#### Outlook

Land in Liberland, both the real and virtual versions thereof, will be tokenized into   
on-chain assets such as NFT’s.
● We aim to utilize our substrate-based blockchain for allour currency and
e-governance services to all current and future citizens of Liberland.
● Oer our blockchain and coin to various exchanges;
● Connect the system to smart contract/DAO generators;
● Allow developers to create and build DAPPs.
● Create our judicial system;
● Connect the blockchain to the metaverse.
Regardingthe lasttopic,we have the following milestones,which might become the
subject of a consecutive Grant Application:

#### Virtual Land and Assets

Land in Liberland, both the real and virtual versions there of, will be tokenized into    
on-chain assets such as NFT’s.   
The initial purchase of the land will be made by an Initial Land Offering(ILO). After the   
land is privatized,further purchases will be made using Liberland's blockcha index   
virtual marketplaces.


#### Merging the Real and the Virtual

Many marketplaces for digital items are currently available on blockchains(primarily
the Ethereum blockchain), such as;
[http://rarible.com](https://rarible.com), [https://opensea.io](https://opensea.io)    
and [http://marketplace.decentraland.org/](http://marketplace.decentraland.org/).   
We will build tools to establish API connections with popular online marketplaces as an 
integral part of our project.
We will ensure that users can apply objects to other objects and that,combining those
objects, eects that somewhat resemble what one might expect in real life will be    
achieved.

#### A marketplace for virtualized real assets

Answering the call of a widespread demand and seeing that there is no comparable
solution currently available and functional/user friendly to the extent which we would   
find desirable, VR Liberland will feature a marketplace of real-world goods.
The real-world goods will be represented:
● In the virtual world as avatars;
● On the blockchain as NFTs;
● By proof of their real-world existence to the prospective seller.
         
         
We envision the first iteration of this project to be a ‘market of markets’. This 
means that people will be allowed and encouraged to place their producton eBay,Amazon,
etc., where the oer goes through the checks of those trustworthy services with
worldwide availability. We will oer an API connection between those more traditional 
services and an NFT token generator, accepting the standards of trust which apply to  
the underlying commercial services.

```
## Additional Information

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?**
Our team is familiar with the Web3 Foundation and the works of Parity due to previous
experience with substrate.


**Any other grants?**
Liberland’s blockchain project has not been granted any previous grants before.We
plan to launch another grant for the decentralized justice system of Liberland in the
near future.
