The first step encompasses a theoretical contribution to map, structure and formalize Polkadot&#x27;s multi-chain environment concepts and relationships, by adopting an ontological approach. Afterwards, we expect this ontological framework to be applied on the building of a controlled natural language (CNL) and a querying engine for the Polkadot ecosystem. </p><p>Ontologies represent concepts and relationships in a manner that approximate the way humans perceive interconnected abstractions, while promoting machine reasoning on top of that representation to offer insights to users, developers and intelligent applications. In addition to supporting reasoning capability, ontologies provide a coherent and easy interpretation, enhancing communication in the ecosystem. They allow users to navigate from one concept to another, supporting the current understanding about the fundamentals of the modeled domain, and also its natural expansion. The R&amp;D process and contributions will be documented in a scientific paper and an ontology representation. Both will be publicly available on github.</p><p>Initially, the proposed ontology will focus on the Polkadot multi-chain environment to identify, describe and relate core concepts of the technology. That is, we will create a conceptual framework that represents the ecosystem behind Polkadot, including parachains, nodes, transaction settlement, cross-chain communication, assets, primitives, etc. With the fundamental aspects defined, it would be possible to expand the ontology to model the concepts and relationships between the Substrate blockchain framework and Polkadot’s canary network, Kusama.</p><p>Moving forward with the state-of-the-art and innovation that tackles real issues is what inspires the MOBR team. As an R&amp;D-oriented startup, we target research opportunities where we can apply AI in a user-centric approach. As Web3 developers and enthusiasts, we are always looking for potential improvements for the technology and its community. The lack of a formal definition and terminology for blockchain environments is an open issue, since it remains open to interpretation and does not offer a consistent representation for its developers, users, and applications.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><ul><li>The problem</li></ul><p>There is no doubt that the Polkadot&#x27;s multi-chain environment is a highly disruptive platform. However, the lack of a formal definition of its terminology is an issue since it remains open to interpretation and does not offer a structured representation for its applications. Currently, Polkadot literature is predominantly written either from a purely technical or from an economical perspective. Aiming at supporting the growth of the Polkadot community in both formal knowledge and applications, it is critical that users, developers, and stakeholders have a formal and fundamental understanding on how the platform is built and how it works. Without such formal representation, application developers may struggle to integrate software components and data, as well as to build querying and reasoning features in a standardized manner. Unstructured development combined with lack of expressiveness about the ecosystem may jeopardize interoperation and wide adoption of Polkadot, especially in heterogeneous socio-technical environments.</p><ul><li>Research questions/hypothesis</li></ul><p>The general research question we want to answer is: how a knowledge-oriented approach may benefit the communicability, integration, usage and development of blockchains?</p><p>And more specifically, how an ontology-supported development impacts design and building of Polkadot’s parachains and cross-chain communication?</p><ul><li>The methodology </li></ul><p>Our approach will begin by conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify key concepts and principles in ontologies for blockchains. This includes studying the existing applications and ontological frameworks that have been developed for blockchains, as well as other relevant research in the fields of symbolic representation. Once the key concepts and principles have been identified, the next step is to create a conceptual framework that incorporates and relates these concepts and principles. This framework will be designed to express the fundamental entities and relationships that govern the Polkadot ecosystem, and will be flexible enough to accommodate the ongoing evolution of the technology. With the conceptual framework specified, the next step will be applying it to a specific Polkadot-related use case scenario. This includes conducting case studies to explore the future application of the ontological framework to support the building of a controlled natural language (CNL) and a querying engine in Polkadot&#x27;s multi-chain environment. Another important aspect of creating an ontology is to engage with experts from application domains to gain their insights and perspectives. This engagement helps to ensure that the ontological framework is grounded in real-world experience and reflects the current understanding of representative personas in the applied fields. In this sense, the final step of the proposed approach is to present and discuss the ontology with members of the Polkadot team.</p><ul><li>Data collection and analysis procedures</li></ul><p>An ontology is a representation of a set of concepts within a domain and the relationships between those concepts. The data collection consists in the search for relevant concepts and their relationships. The initial data for defining the basics of the ontology will be collected through analysis of the available literature, including technical reports from Polkadot documentation. The engagement with the Polkadot team will also produce valuable data to be collected and analyzed. During the consolidation of the basic ontology, analysis will be carried out qualitatively. In the future, after having a consolidated ontology, dynamic tests can be developed to assess more quantitative aspects regarding the coverage of the formal definition. </p><ul><li>Expected results</li></ul><p>The main expected result is an ontology representing the fundamental entities and relationships that govern the Polkadot ecosystem. We will work with the grants team to conduct a qualitative analysis to assess the correctness of the model.</p><ul><li>Relevant related work</li></ul><p>Researchers have been exploring the potential applications and support of ontology to the field of blockchain and DApps in general. For example, ontology has been used to study the concept of trust in blockchain systems, to develop more robust and secure smart contract systems, and to address potential ethical and philosophical issues in the use of blockchain technology <!-- -->[1, 2, 3]<!-- -->.</p><p>Currently, blockchain literature is predominantly written either from a purely technical or from an economic perspective. The use of ontologies in blockchain is an emerging field with significant potential for bridging both technical and economic perspectives, advancing the understanding of this technology while improving its design and use. Research is needed to better explore the potential use cases and applications on top of formal ontologies and to develop a comprehensive ontological framework for this type of technology.</p><p>[1]<!-- --> Besançon, L., Da Silva, C.

For now, we are proposing a conceptual model that will be capable of formalizing the key Polkadot concepts and their relationships. In this proposal we are not considering the development and deployment of any functional asset or prototype, but specifically the ontology representation and a case study to explore the future application of the ontological framework to support building a controlled natural language (CNL) and a query engine in Polkadot’s multi-chain ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>As mentioned, the proposed ontology will focus on the Polkadot multi-chain environment to identify, describe and relate core concepts of the technology.

In the future, the project will allow ecosystem users and developers to retrieve and manipulate data from Polkadot using a controlled natural language. That is, users will be able to intuitively and correctly specify their queries. For instance: How many transactions were carried out for the past 30 min on all parachains? What are the top five wallets with DOT tokens? How many wallets have more DOT tokens than me? What is the total NFT sales volume on the Polkadot ecosystem?</p><ul><li>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?</li></ul><p>To the best of our knowledge, there is no similar project in the ecosystem using a knowledge-oriented approach to support CNL querying.
