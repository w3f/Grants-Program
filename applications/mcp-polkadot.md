## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

`mcp-polkadot` is a proposal for a server that exposes on-chain state to AI agents via MCP. This is done by parsing Substrate's runtime metadata, generating MCP "Resources" from it, and providing an HTTP server running MCP, allowing AI agents to query on-chain data via Polkadot.js. This can serve any Substrate instance's state over MCP via a small, CLI-based webserver.

### Overview

[Model-Context Protocol (MCP)](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol) is an open protocol developed by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) that defines standardized interactions between AI agents and external systems. It is used in many modern agents and tools, including Claude Desktop, OpenAI's SDK, Windsurf, and Cursor. This proposal aims to build a server that exposes on-chain state and runtime metadata for Substrate-based chains (like Kusama, BitTensor, Akash, etc) via Substrate's runtime metadata and MCP, allowing AI agents to interact with blockchain data more effectively.

A larger list of MCP-compatible servers and clients can be found at [awesome-mcp](https://github.com/appcypher/awesome-mcp-servers?tab=readme-ov-file).

### Project Details

`mcp-polkadot` will:

- Connect to a Substrate-based chain via Polkadot.js.
- Fetch the runtime metadata and decompose it into "Resources" available to MCP clients.
- Expose chain state and data through MCP's standardized "Resource" interface
- Implement MCP endpoints that return blockchain data in AI-consumable formats
- Provide TypeScript SDK for easy integration

Technical stack:

- TypeScript/Node.js for the server implementation
- [modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk) for MCP compliance
- Polkadot.js libraries for Substrate interaction
- CLI for easy deployment
- Docker for more testnet/production deployment

The scope of this grant will NOT:

- Work with parachains.
- Send extrinsics.
- Modify or extend the MCP protocol specification itself
- Build end-user applications beyond demonstration purposes

### Ecosystem Fit

This project fits into the Polkadot/Substrate ecosystem by enhancing the accessibility of blockchain data for AI systems. It addresses the following needs:

- Target audience: AI developers, Substrate/Polkadot developers, and teams building AI-enhanced blockchain applications
- Needs: Standardized AI-friendly access to Substrate blockchain data; easier integration between AI assistants and Substrate chains
- Identification: The growth of AI assistants and their ability to interact with structured data systems creates an opportunity to make blockchain data more accessible through standardized protocols like MCP

There are currently no similar projects in the Substrate/Polkadot ecosystem that specifically focus on Model-Context Protocol integration. This project aims to bridge Substrate projects with the latest technology in the AI and agent space.

## Development Status :open_book:

This project is in the initial planning phase. The concept builds upon:

- The Polkadot.js libraries for Substrate chain interaction
- Existing knowledge and documentation about Substrate runtime metadata structure and chain state access

## Future Plans

This proposal aims to build a simple MCP interface for Substrate chains Future plans can include:

- supporting cross-parachain queries.
- supporting queries into smart contract state (eg. ink!, EVM)
- supporting multiple Substrate-chains through the same binary
- the construction and submission of extrinsics
- working with the community to identify and implement additional features and use cases
- promoting the project to AI developers to increase adoption and blockchain accessibility
- exploring commercial support options for teams building production applications
