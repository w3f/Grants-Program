# W3F Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** The InvArch - INV4 Frame : IP Assets, Licensings, & CLI tool for the Substate ecosystem.
* **Team Name:** InvArch Network
* **aUSD Payment Address:** 25aeg1bNLXaYm526R7cXfQNtpEvnv9S23eR17AeDtm5BD7Ce (PLEASE NOTE CHANGE)
* **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

* The InvArch Network is the cross-chain IP development & authentication hub built on Polkadot. InvArch provides a proven & validated "best-to-market"
environment for IP Assets & dApps, where as the InvArch Tinkernet provides a "first-to-market" bleeding-edge environment on Kusama for testing. 
The Eureka Relay is envisioned for future scaling improvements.

### The InvArch Network is powered by the INV4, On-Chain Innovation Funding (OCIF), & Cross-Chain Authentication (XCA) protocols.
* INV4 is responsible for defining how IP Assets are defined, stored, & interacted with across Web3.
* OCIF harnesses new & transparent funding possibilities to direct wealth towards the incentivization of realizing IP & unlocking true value.
* XCA unlocks the power of a trustless XC file tracking & data fingerprinting solution that realizes files just as uniquely as NFTs do with CIDs.

Under this grant, the [InvArch INV4 FRAME](https://github.com/InvArch/InvArch-Frames/tree/main/INV4) will be released & maintained by the InvArch
Network team. The INV4 FRAME is a Rust Pallet Module for Substrate-based chains that realizes the INV4 protocol, and as a result, the possibility for
on-chain IP Assets, Licenses, & flexibility for international compliance. IP Assets will be showcased in the Substate ecosystem. The INV4 FRAME Pallet
is a critical component to the InvArch Network's runtime & is hoursed within the [InvArch FRAME Pallet Library](https://github.com/InvArch/InvArch-Frames).

Every member of the time has an honest belief that this project will help make the world better through increased economic decentralization and by
helping to catalyze future innovations, it's a belief that motivates and inspires every one of us to see this project through. Together, we have
fostered a community of nearly 20,000 incredible supporters, partners, & ambassadors from all around the globe who understand & believe in the InvArch
mission. We have also held many exciting discussions with other Parachain teams about the empowering, understandable, and novel applications that on-chain IP will bring to the ecosystem.

### InvArch approaches ideas (IP) as a set of non-fungible components: The INV4 Protocol 
* IP Sets - Either a Root or Parent IP Set, and/or a Child Subset (collections) of interchangeable & freely composable IP Files & NFTs. 
* IP Files - NFT-based files that which can emulate or contain any content or data as found as any other file on the internet & local devices.
* IP Licenses - On-chain Licensing agreements pegged to an IP Set that can be used to allocate ownership, manage custom access, & define utility.
* IP Tokens - Fungible tokens pegged to an IP Set & managed using an IP License; multiple unique classes of IP Tokens can be pegged to the same IP Set.

* When interacting with `Pallet_ips` users can call the following functions `create_ips`, `destroy`, `append`, `remove`, `Allow_replica`, `Disallow_replica`, & `Create_replica`.
* When interacting with `Pallet_ipf` users can call the following functions: `mint` & `burn`.
* When interacting with `Pallet_ipl` users can call the following functions: `set_asset_weight` & `set_permission`.
* When interacting with `Pallet_ipt` users can call the following functions: `mint`, `burn`, `create_subasset`, `operate_multisig`, `vote_multisig`, `withdraw_vote_multisig`, `burn`.
* While some hidden functions are only callable by the actual Pallets in the INV4 FRAME themselves.

### Technologies
1. Rust
2. Substrate
3. Polkadot.js

### Components

### InvArch INV4 FRAME

### 1. IP Sets & IP Files
* `Pallet_ips` - Provides basic functionality for creating and managing an `IPSet`. You can think of an `IPSet` as an idea, which is basically a collection of components (intellectual property tokens) that define and describe that idea.
* `Pallet_ipf` - Provides basic functionality for creating and managing an `IPToken`. You can think of an `IPToken` as a component of an idea. For example, a business summary PDF file, or even a 3D rendering of a prototype mold. When combined and stored in an `IPSet`, that collection forms the foundtion for an idea. The more detailed and/or comprehensive an `IPSet` is, the stronger the idea.

  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/2q9ZJcP/IPL.png">
</div>

### 2. IP Licenses & Tokens
* `Pallet_dev` - Provides basic functionality for structuring, managing, and listing a `DEV`(Decentralized Entrepreneurial Venture). You can think of a `DEV` as an agreement between multiple parties to come together as cofounders over a project in order to contribute towards an `IPSet`'s actualization.
* `Pallet_dao` - Provides basic functionality for creating and managing a `DAO` that helps govern a `DEV`. You can think of a `DAO` as a `DEV`'s governance mechanism. It helps regulate the and ensure the integrity and prudence of participants within a `DEV`.
* `Pallet_worklog` - Provides basic functionality for creating and managing a `WorkLog` within a `DEV`. You can think of a `Worklog` as a `DEV`'s method of recording and storing milestone/deliverables progressions and completions.

<div align=center>
  <img src="https://i.ibb.co/4WCtTzh/055.png">
</div>

* Ownership can be fractionalized using multiple pegged fungible assets representing ownership (ARO). An ARO is (typically) reflected in the first IP Token (IPT) attached to an IP Set. The asset ID of an ARO is defined in a copyright ownership agreement, and there can be multiples of these fungible assets.

### Ecosystem Fit

:link:  **Chains and Pallets**<br>
InvArch applies the categories below:
* NFT
* Governance/DAO
* Other (IP Assets)

### Project Uniqueness
* The world's first truly composable network for fully unlocking IP assets & on-chain IP attribution solution (that is flexible for its assets to experience international compliance in business, copyright, & legal transactions. InvArch revolutionizes the world of innovation beginning at the very start of development & pushes the bounds of web3 by taking existing concepts & challenging them to be different and better. By unlocking new doors & redefining whatâ€™s possible, InvArch will revolutionize the worlds of technical development & real-world collaboration down to their very core.

### Target Audience
* Entrepreneurs/Innovators
* Developers/DAOs/Artists
