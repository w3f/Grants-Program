## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Ink Contracts Wizard is an UI based smart contract generation tool. It will scaffold Smart Contracts based on the options selected by the user. User can also download the contracts if required. All the Contracts will be scaffolded from GitHub and anyone can contribute to UI as well as contracts since everything will be open source.

### Motivation
A lot of people use OpenZepplin's Smart Contract Wizard tool on daily basis since they are industry standard. We will be taking smart contracts from Ink GitHub Examples repo: https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples

### Ecosystem Fit
 - Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Anyone who wants to quickly scaffold smart contract by filling a simple form in the UI can use our platform.
 - Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Anyone who wants to create Smart Contracts on top of Ink are our target users.


### User Journey
 - User visits Ink Smart Contract Wizard website.
 - User selects option in which she wants there smart contracts to have functionality.
 - User will be able to generate the Smart Contract.
 - User can download the smart Contract.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

*  **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 weeks

*  **Total Costs:** 8,000 USD

### Milestone 1

*  **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks

*  **Costs:** 4,000 USD


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | Apache License 2.0 | All code will be published under Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code. |
| 0c. | Testing and it's Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests written in rust test which is a great test runner to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 0e. | Articles | We will publish a series of articles on how to develop smart contracts on top of this platform. |
| 0. | Conversion of smart contracts written in Ink to it's components. | We will be using this repo examples: https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples and will convert them into basic components in JSON format. |
| 1. | Creation of code generation logic for Ink smart contracts. | We will be building our own code generator. It will take JSON as input and will product Rust code as output. |

### Milestone 2

*  **Estimated Duration:** 2 weeks

*  **Costs:** 4,000 USD


| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | Apache License 2.0 | All code will be published under Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can run the frontend code and generate Ink smart contracts. |
| 0c. | Testing and it's Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by comprehensive unit tests written in Jest to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. We will serve our frontend via NGINX as our reverse proxy. |
| 0e. | Articles | We will publish a series of tutorials along with online workshops within our discord community so that we can educate our users the use of this platform. |
| 0. | smart Contract generator Page | We will be building our generator using NextJS. People will be able to generate smart contract using our UI platform. |
