## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Ink Contracts Wizard is an UI based smart contract generation tool. It will scaffold Smart Contracts based on the options selected by the user. User can also download the contracts if required. All the Contracts will be scaffolded from GitHub and anyone can contribute to UI as well as contracts since everything will be open source.

### Motivation
A lot of people use OpenZepplin's Smart Contract Wizard tool on daily basis since they are industry standard. We will be taking smart contracts from Ink GitHub Examples repo: https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/master/examples

### Ecosystem Fit
 - Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
Anyone who wants to quickly scaffold smart contract by filling a simple form in the UI can use our platform.
 - Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
Anyone who wants to create Smart Contracts on top of Ink are our target users.


### User Journey
 - User visits Ink Smart Contract Wizard website.
 - User selects option in which she wants there smart contracts to have functionality.
 - User will be able to generate the Smart Contract.
 - User can download the smart Contract.
