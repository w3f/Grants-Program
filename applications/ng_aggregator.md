## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
A Defi Aggregator Wallet connect more users to Polkadot Ecosystem

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A Defi Aggregator which will integrate Substrate modular framework
  * Will Pass cross-chain messages, combines to Polkadot
  * Aggregators emphasize UX/UI improvements over the liquidity layer, whereas the liquidity layer is singularly focused on improving the core underlying functionality (lending, exchange, etc). 
  * The integration with Polkadot will maximize utilize the asset management across various chains and different defi protocols.


### Project Details 
We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):
* Mockups/designs of UI components

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone. 

For each milestone:
* Please be sure to include a specification of your software. Treat it as a contract - the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
To assist you in defining it, we created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../src/grant_guidelines_per_category.md).
* Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
* Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
* Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
* Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project. 
* Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.
* Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory and should not be removed, unless you explicitly specify a reason within the PR's `Additional Notes` section (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test)

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 2-3 months
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  2-3 FTE
* **Total Costs:** 2BTC
