## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

`subalfred`'s goal is to become an all-in-one Substrate development toolbox.

It provides a bunch of tools to make the developers feel more comfortable while playing with Substrate.

### Project Details

Check the [Subalfred Book](https://subalfred.hack.ink).

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  - A CLI tool is written in Rust that Substrate developers can use anywhere.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  - I encourage all the Substrate developers to try this tool.
    I believe there must be at least one feature that benefits them.
- What need(s) does your project meet?
  - Improve the experience for Substrate developers.
  - Speed up the debug/development process.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - Some features are unique and some features are similar to the other projects.
  - If so, how is your project different?
    - [`subalfred key`](https://subalfred.hack.ink/user/cli/key.html) vs [Subscan format transform tool](https://polkadot.subscan.io/tools/format_transform)
      - Can be use offline.
      - Use official [ss58-registry](https://github.com/paritytech/ss58-registry) as dependency directly.
      - Detect the key type automatically.
      - Accept `ParaId(u32)` as input.
      - Accept `PalletId([u8; 8])` as input.
    - [`subalfred state export`](https://subalfred.hack.ink/user/cli/state.html#export) vs [fork-off-substrate](https://github.com/maxsam4/fork-off-substrate)
      - Use Rust instead of JS. No variable size limitation, easily export large chain state.
      - Use WS/Rust/Async. Faster, max speed up to 20k pairs per second.
    - [`subalfred rpc`](https://subalfred.hack.ink/user/cli/rpc.html) vs `curl`
      - More concise syntax.
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?
    - No.

## Development Status :open_book:

> [GitHub](https://github.com/hack-ink/subalfred), [Subalfred Book](https://subalfred.hack.ink)

There are three parts:

- [CLI](https://github.com/hack-ink/subalfred/tree/main/src/bin/subalfred) components.
- [Core libraries](https://github.com/hack-ink/subalfred/tree/main/src/subalfred).
- [Substrate minimal libraries](https://github.com/hack-ink/subalfred/tree/main/substrate-minimal),
  some Substrate libraries's re-implementations reduce the unnecessary dependencies as much as possible.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website / Medium / Twitter / Element / Announcement by another team / personal recommendation / etc.
From my team, Darwinia Network.

As I said, `subalfred`'s goal is to become an all-in-one Substrate development toolbox.
I browsed Substrate's issues and was active on Substrate StackExchange,
and discuss with other developers to know what do they need while developing on Substrate.
Currently, I have already implemented some of them and plan to do more.
So, I hope all these features can be a part of this grant.

According to your suggestions.
I'll document every public functions, and write unit tests for them.
There are around 30+ features.
Please note this is a part of milestone 1.

I'd love to convert these milestone to issues on the [repository](https://github.com/hack-ink/subalfred).
It will be much easier to track the status.

### Amending

- Remove **0.d** from milestone **1** and **2**. Because I realize that it is much easier for you to test this with a simple `cargo test` command. So, I decide to use **cargo** instead of **docker**. [Discussion](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/615#issuecomment-1308480639)
