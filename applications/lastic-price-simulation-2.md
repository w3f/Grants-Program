## Project Overview

### Overview
The **Coretime Sale Price Calculator** represents a breakthrough in democratizing blockspace pricing within the Polkadot ecosystem. Developed in anticipation of Polkadot's Coretime, this tool will enable interactive, real-time simulations of Coretime pricing. Our objective is twofold: to offer the community a comprehensive view of Coretime pricing dynamics and to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities in the `broker pallet`'s pricing mechanisms, thereby safeguarding against unintended outcomes.

### Project Details

- **UI Components:** Our tool will incorporate interactive sliders and real-time graph visualizations, as currently demonstrated in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/LasticXYZ/price-simulation). The application is approximately 60% complete and you can get a prieview of it's non final stage at [lastic.streamlit.app](https://lastic.streamlit.app/).
- **Data Models:** We utilize adaptable Coretime pricing models, accessible through a user-friendly interface.
- **Technology Stack:** Our technology stack includes Python and Streamlit for the web application, supplemented by Numpy and Matplotlib.
- **Inspiration:** Our work is inspired by the [`Broker pallet`](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/tree/master/substrate/frame/broker).
- **Documentation:** Comprehensive documentation, including details on core components and interface interaction, will be available at our [docs site](https://docs.lastic.xyz/).
- **PoC/MVP:** The current implementation, visible in [our repository](https://github.com/LasticXYZ/price-simulation), is live at [lastic.streamlit](https://lastic.streamlit.app/).

### Ecosystem Fit

- **Ecosystem Role:** Our project is strategically positioned to enhance understanding of the new blockspace pricing dynamics within the Polkadot ecosystem.
- **Target Audience:** Our tool is designed for:
  - **Substrate Developers:** to gain a better grasp of pricing dynamics.
  - **Parachain Teams:** to adapt to the shift from slot auctions to Coretime renewals.
  - **New Coretime Buyers:** giving them insights into Coretime pricing.
  - **Polkadot Analysts and Analytics Providers:** in need of real-time Coretime data.
  - **DOT Holders and the Wider Polkadot Community:** to understand the implementation of Coretime pricing.

Our engagement with the community, as evidenced by the [Polkadot forum discussion](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/seeking-community-insight-on-coretime-price-simulation-model/4527), has already led to the identification of a potential vulnerability affecting new core purchases. Our goal is to refine the application further, ensuring that the Python code aligns with what is implemented within the `Broker pallet`, and to develop models that address and eliminate identified vulnerabilities.

- **Addressing the Needs:** We provide a transparent, intuitive tool for simulating Coretime pricing, enabling teams to anticipate how demand and core availability might influence pricing.
- **Comparison to Existing Solutions:** To our knowledge, there are no other initiatives aimed at simulating the Coretime pricing as implemented currently.

### Team's experience

#### **Phil Lucsok**: 
Phil began his career in web3 as a marketing and communications manager for a Bitcoin startup in Berlin in 2013 called [BitcoinsBerlin](https://web.archive.org/web/20220707055043/https://bitcoinsberlin.com/). There, he created marketing campaigns for multiple products including:
- [All4BTC](https://all4btc.com/) - a one-stop shop for purchasing anything on Amazon or eBay with bitcoin
- Bills4BTC (later [Bitwala](https://bitwala.com/), Nuri) - a SEPA-compliant payment method for holders of Bitcoin for regular payments
- e4BTC - an electronics shop supporting purchases in Bitcoin

After this, he worked for 3.5 years at [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), a web2 social media platform for scientific researchers, where he learned skills in Product Management, Product Analytics, UX development and copywriting and design, and industry-standard growth practices.

In late 2017, Phil joined Parity Technologies to lead technical communications on Ethereum and Polkadot. There he worked closely with developers to create promotional content for open-source products including Parity Ethereum, Parity Signer, Polkadot.js. It was between 2018 and 2020 where he represented Parity in Ethereum governance to help recover the stuck funds from the November 2017 multisig hack. 

He led the communications team for the first two years, growing the team from 1 to 12, where they created and executed the launch strategies for Polkadot, Kusama and Substrate. After that he joined the Ecosystem Success team to work with parachain teams to improve their communications and act as a liason between Substrate Builders Program teams and Parity.

Phil currently works as a freelancer but is focused on leading [Missing Link](https://www.missing-link.io/)'s marketing, communications and governance strategies. He is also an active participant in Polkadot governance discussions on the Kusamarian and in ChaosDAO.

*Note: Phil Lucsok has previously applied at the Web3 Foundation and has successfully completed Lastic Grant 1.*

#### **Aurora Poppyseed**:
Aurora's journey in the technological sphere stands out for her innovative approach and unwavering determination. With a foundation in Physics and Electrical Engineering, she transitioned into roles as varied as a Solutions Architect, focusing on electronics and low-level programming, to a Frontend Developer with a commitment to clean code and scalable frontend architectures. 

At [**Instrumentation Technologies**](https://www.i-tech.si/) in Nova Gorica, Slovenia, she led the design of intuitive GUIs for advanced measurement devices in particle accelerators and streamlined future development with a standardized Vue CLI-based web GUI framework. Her contribution as a Frontend Developer at [**Block Analitica**](https://blockanalitica.com/) involved engineering the frontend framework for the [**Ajna project**](https://www.ajna.finance/) initiated by the **MakerDAO team**, ensuring clean coding practices and an organized project structure for future open-source contributions.

Aurora attended and graduated from the [**Polkadot Blockchain Academy**](https://www.polkadot.network/development/academy/) at UC Berkeley (engineering track), learning about the fundamentals of blockchain from leaders in this domain. Further enhancing her mark in the blockchain domain, Aurora offered her expertise to [**KodaDot**](https://kodadot.xyz/), a prominent multi-chain NFT marketplace, developing developer documentation and crafting both technical and non-technical articles to amplify the platform's presence.

In the realm of community engagement and organization, Aurora co-organized the [**Polkadot Bled mini-conference**](https://www.meetup.com/subwork/events/292274713) and more recently, orchestrated a breakfast as a side event at sub0 aimed at [**women in Polkadot** in collaboration with **H.E.R. Dao**](https://lu.ma/dzuqx5nw). This gathering aimed to empower and bring together women leaders and enthusiasts in the Polkadot ecosystem. Furthermore, she's a staunch supporter of [**SubWork**](https://subwork.xyz/), a tech-centric coworking hub in the scenic Bled region and one of the pioneer **Polkadot hubs**.

Now a freelance blockchain developer, Aurora champions women's representation in Polkadot and ardently supports community-driven blockchain initiatives.
