Since then we did a lot of research and improved the approach. We did rebranding; SensioPhoto is <a href="http://Kelp.Digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelp Digital</a> and SensioNetwork is <a href="http://Anagolay.Network" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anagolay Network</a>.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h2><p>Anagolay is a peer-to-peer network that stores records of Rights (Copyright, Licenses, and Ownership), Restrictions, and Proofs of any digital content. It empowers the users to store, claim, sell, and rent their work with the correct transfer of Rights and usage of Licenses. Actual digital data is <em>never</em> stored on the chain, only the respective cryptographic proof. As such, it acts as an identifier, verifiable by users who have access to that same data without disclosing it in the process.</p><p>In this grant we will focus on the core building blocks, <strong>Operation</strong> and a <strong>Workflow</strong>.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation">Operation<a href="#operation" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation" title="Direct link to Operation">​</a></h3><p>Operation is a well-structured library with standardized input and output signatures, written in Rust and compiled to WASM. It acts as a lego piece, which you use to connect to other pieces, creating a Workflow. Operation itself consists of two parts, a Manifest and a <a href="#operation-version">Version</a>. The Version uses a content versioning system which allows it to be used as a dependency exactly as it is, always. This solves the problem when a dependency introduces breaking changes at the patch version or gets sold to a bad actor and they <a href="https://github.com/greatsuspender/thegreatsuspender/issues/1263" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ship malicious code</a>, or it&#x27;s <a href="https://www.theregister.com/2016/03/23/npm_left_pad_chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">removed</a> from the centralized registry. The Manifest contains the data which describe the Operation inputs, outputs, potential configuration, execution group, and a few other fields for developers, like description and name. Once Operation is created, the Manifest cannot be updated and all Versions must adhere to the Manifest entirely. There are three types of Operations: <code>User</code>, <code>FlowControl</code>, and <code>System</code>. In this grant, we will focus on <code>System</code> Operations and their execution.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation-version">Operation Version<a href="#operation-version" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation Version" title="Direct link to Operation Version">​</a></h4><p>It is the source code that conforms and implements the interfaces and functionality explained in the Manifest. This is what gets published and compiled and what is used in the Workflow execution. Since all the Operation Versions have the same Manifest, what can differ is the underlying improvements to either performance or dependency update. Each new version goes through the same verification process as if it were the first one, <em>this will not be implemented in this grant</em>, which at the end marks the version as <code>approved</code>. This approach minimizes the introduction of bad code and hold everybody involved responsible for code quality.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow">Workflow<a href="#workflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow" title="Direct link to Workflow">​</a></h3><p>Workflow is a collection of Operations, chained together producing a tree-like structure where the leaf Operation is the entry-point. Once executed, they produce the list of strings that act as the input data identifiers, we call them <strong>Proofs</strong>. The way how Operations are linked together is by following this rule <code>OperationA.outputType === OperationB.inputType</code>, this is a standardized interface that every Operation must implement. Execution is performed from bottom to top, where the most bottom operation acts as an entry point for receiving the data. When Operation is executed the Workflow execution function will pass the output as an input to the parent Operation, and so on until the execution reaches the top level when it stops. The Workflow doesn&#x27;t contain the Operation manifest, rather direct links to the Versions.
You can see <a href="#workflow-for-image-poe">here</a> a diagram how one Workflow might look like.</p><p>Execution</p><p>The most important environment for Workflow execution is Browser (WebWorkers) and Nodejs. All the Operations are compiled to WASM which can be run almost <a href="https://webassembly.org/roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">anywhere</a>. Each Operation passes the data to its parent as a <code>bincode ByteArray</code>, then the parent Operation deserializes it and uses it. It&#x27;s the most efficient way we found which still keeps the execution in optimal speed limits.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="on-decentralized-storage">On decentralized storage<a href="#on-decentralized-storage" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to On decentralized storage" title="Direct link to On decentralized storage">​</a></h3><p>Decentralized storage is a complex topic where many projects contribute in different ways. In the whole ecosystem, there are two distinct subdomains, ones with the token, and one without. Essentially all of them are trying to find the best way to incentivize people to store other people&#x27;s data, to make sure the data stays available over a long period of time via contract-based approach like FileCoin and Crust, or store data permanently like Arweave. Some of the projects have high entry hardware requirements, some little bit less, but all of them agree that unused harddrive resources can be utilized and contributed to the respective network. Each of the projects gives guarantees about the data durability, either through the on-chain <em>Deal</em> or as a default, in case of permanent storage.</p><p>Now when we explained the projects that contain the token/coin, let&#x27;s talk about the vanilla IPFS and how it compares to others. Based on the image below, you can see that some of the projects mentioned above are built on top of, or work with the IPFS. This gives them out-of-the-box all of the IPFS features. What IPFS doesn&#x27;t provide, is the guarantee that the uploaded content will be available forever, BUT it can, it all depends on the people who host it without any monetary incentive, rather than the reason they want to host it. Also, there is a lot smaller hardware requirement for hosting a normal IPFS node than being a miner/validator for big projects mentioned above.</p><p>Thing is that, why not use both? One as a temporary, short-term, high-volume storage of not so important data and another as permanent storage for the data we want to keep forever.</p><p>This is the approach we are taking in Anagolay, storing the important data like Operation Version and Workflow Manifest. Our main requirements regarding decentralized storage are:</p><ul><li>content addressability or IPFS based</li><li>permanency</li><li>high durability ( at least 11 9s )</li></ul><p>At the time of writing, there not a single project that provides the all three requirements, although Arweave + IPFS can work. We will use the Anagolay-hosted public IPFS cluster which will be used as short-term storage and as permanent storage until we have the <em>real</em> permanent storage connected.</p><p>Even though this poses the problem of centralization, where we host all the Operations and their source code, nothing prevents developers who build their Operations and Workflows, to spin up the IPFS node and pin only the content they are interested in. This also applies to any other dApp, they can personally host IPFS node or use Infura and friends, to pin the Operations and Workflows they depend on. <a href="https://kelp.notion.site/FileCoin-vs-Crust-vs-Arweave-vs-IPFS-d5d4943e66e74f1381b36b28bdc030bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here</a> is a page we maintain, which contains the comparison table of decentralized storage providers.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="example-of-how-this-approach-affects-other-things">Example of how this approach affects other things<a href="#example-of-how-this-approach-affects-other-things" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Example of how this approach affects other things" title="Direct link to Example of how this approach affects other things">​</a></h3><p>The most obvious examples where this approach is a game-changer are the NFT marketplaces. Especially when it comes to the definition of uniqueness. NFT is considered to be a unique thing, but it&#x27;s not. What is unique is the identifier and not the content. It is possible to mint the same image as an NFT on different marketplaces ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntyZ1tCy9Is" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kelp Digital Are NFTs as Unique as We Think? video</a> ) and on some marketplaces slightly modified image you can mint again, this alone states that there is no uniqueness. What we are building is a way to determine the uniqueness of the digital content. The Proofs are plural, they are the describing identifiers of the image. When this gets implemented, the NFT will be obsolete and either die out or become something else. Why? Because we rely on the identifiers of the content rather than on the incrementing value which is obtained through the minting process and that makes every image or digital data potential NFT without minting. Third parties ( current NFT marketplaces ) can execute specific Workflow to obtain the Proofs, which they can store internally, or query Anagolay Network to see are these Proofs match any records with claimed Copyrights or Ownerships. Due to the nature of the Operation and its return, not every time, all Proofs will match, especially for an image; remember that the 2 out of 3 are cryptographic proofs, and one is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locality-sensitive_hashing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LSH</a> proof which can be used to calculate the similarity between the original image data and one that is already claimed. We can say that the distance of 0.98 will be considered as valid Proof of equality which means that the uploaded data is already known to the system and already has the owner. Example Workflow is <a href="#workflow-for-image-poe">here</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="workflow-for-image-poe">Workflow for image PoE<a href="#workflow-for-image-poe" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Workflow for image PoE" title="Direct link to Workflow for image PoE">​</a></h3><p>Here is a working example of the Workflow, represented as a diagram for the dependencies only which at the end of the execution provide 3 proofs; 2 CIDs and 1 Perceptual hash.

The list of extrinsics is not 100% defined yet and what we have might be subject to change, but what we have defined is the following:</p><p><strong>Extrinsics</strong>:</p><ul><li><code>create</code> - This extrinsic is used to store the Operation, their version, and the mapping. All mandatory checks are run before the saving. The submitting account ID will be the owner of the data.</li><li><code>approve_version</code> - This extrinsic is used to approve the OperationVersion after a successful test from the community. This part will come later and this is used now to build a base for new features and as a rule where every OperationVersion must be approved before being used in the Workflow  </li></ul><p><strong>Storage</strong>:</p><ul><li><code>Operations</code> -  <code>StorageDoubleMap</code> is a mapping between the <code>Operation_CID</code>, <code>AccountID</code>, and the actual data</li><li><code>OperationCount</code> -  <code>StorageValue</code> a <code>u64</code> incremented when we create Operation</li><li><code>OperationVersions</code> - <code>StorageMap</code>, a mapping between the <code>Operation_CID</code> and <code>Vec&lt;OperationVersion&gt;</code>, where the last item is considered to be the latest</li></ul><p><a href="https://anagolay.dev/about/operation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">V1 of Operation is explained here</a></p><p><a href="#milestone-1--implement-core-functionality">◀️ Go back to Milestone 1</a></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="operation---op_file">Operation - op_file<a href="#operation---op_file" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Operation - op_file" title="Direct link to Operation - op_file">​</a></h3><p>We will create an Anagolay operation called file. This operation can take a string or a file buffer. In the case of the string, it will read the file and return the file buffer instance, in the case of a buffer it will return the correct instance. This way we can make sure that all targeted environments are using the same file reading approach and correct return data. Of course, the wasm will accept the <code>ArrayBuffer</code> and it will be correctly returned for any other operation that is executed after in the browser environment. Nodejs and Rust can simply pass the file path as a string and the <code>op_file</code> will read it.</p><p><a href="#milestone-1--implement-core-functionality">◀️ Go back to Milestone 1</a></p><h3
