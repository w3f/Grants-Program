Democracy is about fair and equal treatment of everyone in a country. But it becomes unrealistic to achieve when political parties have their conflict of interest, and leaders don’t have the expertise to make evidence-based policies and neither have the skill and manpower for solving problems that surround our society and ecosystem. The new fair democracy provides an elegant way of governance that separates the representative responsibility according to their specialization and can grow into any complexity. The governance is divided into various departments, and each department is supervised by representatives with expertise in the field. Voters are rational and need to have enough knowledge about the departments and the department problems, in order to vote for the selecting representatives of a department. The selection process of representatives is “difficult in and easy out”,
which allows only utilitarian actors to hold the responsibility, weeding out frivolous ones.  </p><p><a href="https://shivarthu.reaudito.com/paper/Shivarthu_whitepaper.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://shivarthu.reaudito.com/paper/Shivarthu_whitepaper.pdf</a></p><p>Shivarthu will be build on Substrate.</p><p>Our democracy has many challenges, blockchain can provide a way to tackle those challenges by minimizing trust through game theory.

Experience is required because education about the department leads to better decision making.
Their experience is evaluated by schelling game.</p><img loading="lazy" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/amiyatulu/shivarthu_mockups/main/Portfolio.svg" alt="portfolio" height="600" class="img_ev3q"><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="schelling-game">Schelling Game<a href="#schelling-game" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Schelling Game" title="Direct link to Schelling Game">​</a></h4><p>In this project, the Schelling game is used for experise evaluation and review of projects. We use a modification of Schelling game named score Schelling game for fund distribution of projects.
Juror applies for making a decision like whether the required experience can be accepted or review quality of projects is acceptable. The probability of being drawn as a juror is proportional to the amount of tokens a juror stakes. The higher the amount of tokens he stakes, the higher the probability that he will be drawn as a juror. Also, jurors are drawn randomly. This protects the system from sybil attacks.
We will use the substrate randomness trait for generating a random number.
<a href="https://substrate.dev/recipes/randomness.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://substrate.dev/recipes/randomness.html</a>
Then jurors will vote for their decision using the commit and reveal scheme. In the commit phase, they submit the hash of the vote string. Then, in the reveal phase, they submit the hash and the vote string. If the vote string matches with the hash, then the vote is accepted.
If a juror&#x27;s vote is coherent (more than 51% of other jurors agree) then they receive incentives, otherwise, incentives are deducted from the stake of the juror.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="voting-for-selection-of-representatives">Voting for selection of representatives<a href="#voting-for-selection-of-representatives" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Voting for selection of representatives" title="Direct link to Voting for selection of representatives">​</a></h4><p>The election is multi-winner approval.  We will use seq-phragmen of the substrate to select the representatives.

People will submit their problems, for example, waterlogging in the locality.
Then experts all around the globe will submit the solution. The solution will be peer-reviewed to check its pros, cons, and suggest improvements that can be made. The review must meet the scientific guidelines. The solution can undergo revision through peer review feedback.
The solution provider and peer reviewer have to stake some money to receive incentives for their work. The solution and peer review will again be approved and disapproved through the shelling game after checking whether the content meets the quality as recommended in scientific guidelines. The solutions provider and reviewer will get the incentives if it gets approved, otherwise, some money will be cut from the stake. It creates pressure on the reviewer to maintain quality without noise.</p><img loading="lazy" src="https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmUTMU4ndH6TpjYZkuES78wDNbMKLr1d2eSjE6SMh4nmwJ/Problem_Solution.svg" alt="Problem Solution" height="600" class="img_ev3q"><p>The representatives of the department will select the most optimal solution.

If the “mean” of all the product rating is near to your rating then the juror will get incentives, otherwise, juror incentives will be deducted. So, the juror will try to match the score with what others will assign based on information available rather than defecting by any arbitrary rating.
We can discover the prices of projects that need to be funded from a common funding pool.
Here is an algorithm:</p><p>1) When you submit a project, you need to provide details of the funding needed for work to be done.
You can’t provide a funding amount value of more than 4/5 power of the total funding pool amount.
e.g. If the total funding pool has $50000, you can’t assign a value larger than $5743
2) Then, we will have a percentage Schelling game to predict the price. That is, you can predict whether to increase or decrease the funding amount in percentage. Remember, it can’t be larger than (Total funding pool amount)^(4/5). Score values will remain from -10 to +10, -10 means 100% decrease, +10 means 100% increase
The range of -10 to +10 has a problem because the mean works best without extreme values. So, if someone gives -10, and others give 1, the mean result can get screwed due to the -10 outlier. So the trick is to remove outliers by computing the standard deviation. Remove all values more than one standard deviation away from the mean. Then, we calculate the new mean of the left values (it consists of 68.27% data of the set).
Code to calculate new mean:

The score range is 0-5
4) The amount of funding will be directly proportional to (Predicted Price) <em> (Quality Score/5</em>2)
