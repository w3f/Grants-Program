## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkadot Smart Chain (PSC) is an Ethereum-compatible smart contract parachain which uses directly Polkadot Native Currency as the native gas fee.

Almost all parachains now are custom native currencies. 
For Polkadot community users holding Polkadot Native Currency, these currencies are redundant. 
While maintaining the security of the Polkadot network (Reserve-Based-Transfer), 
PSC have brought an evm parachain that supports rich Dapps to Polkadot Native Currency holders.

### Project Details

- Transfer Polkadot Native Currency from Polkadot to PSC by DMP
  ![dmp](https://github.com/OmniBTC/PSC/blob/main/docs/dmp.png)
- Transfer Polkadot Native Currency from PSC to Polkadot by UMP
  ![ump](https://github.com/OmniBTC/PSC/blob/main/docs/ump.png)
- **[pallet-assets](https://github.com/OmniBTC/PSC/tree/main/pallets/assets)**:
  
  WASM assets can be sent/received by XCMP. 

- **[AssetsBridgeErc20.sol](https://github.com/OmniBTC/PSC/blob/main/contracts/AssetsBridgeErc20.sol)**:
  
  Erc20 tokens can be sent/received by ethereum bridges.

- **[pallet-assets-bridge](https://github.com/OmniBTC/PSC/tree/main/pallets/assets-bridge)**: 
  
  Bind EVM address and Substrate account, bind WASM assets and Erc20 tokens, deposit and withdraw fungible assets between WASM and EVM

- Deploy EVM contracts with Polkadot Native Currency by truffle/remix/metamask.

### Ecosystem Fit

- (1) PSC uses Polkadot Native Currency as the original gas to directly empower Polkadot Native Currency, allowing Polkadot community users who 
      hold Polkadot Native Currency to cross-chain to PSC through XCMP, deploy and call EVM defi contracts on PSC.

- (2) Our target audience is most users who hold Polkadot Native Currency, as well as potential parachain teams in the future 
      (providing them with technical references)

- (3) The parachain community provides various applications, but they use their own native currency as transaction fee, 
      and users holding Polkadot Native Currency can only use those applications by selling their Polkadot Native Currency in exchange for their currency.
      PSC directly brings these DEFI applications to Polkadot Native Currency users.

- (4) We are the first team to eat crabs. We directly empower Polkadot Native Currency to make the Polkadot community more united.

- (5) [Acala](https://github.com/AcalaNetwork/Acala) only uses evm and does not support ethereum api. PSC, [Astar](https://github.com/AstarNetwork/Astar), and [Moonbeam](https://github.com/PureStake/moonbeam) are all based on frontier and fully support ethereum api.
      Both Astar and Moonbeam are committed to being an evm contract platform. Although PSC has the same potential, the early goal is to empower Polkadot Native Currency.
      Before using the functions of the Acala/Astar/Moonbeam chain, Polkadot Native Currency users must purchase their Native Currencies, and the Native Curreny of PSC is the Polkadot Native Currency transferred from the relay chain, no need to purchase any assets.

## Future Plans

- PSC will run as a parachain of the Polkadot.
- In phase 1, we first support Polkadot Native Currency's asset cross-chain(through DMP/UMP) and wasm-evm asset bridge.
- In phase 2, receive other parachain native currency through XCMP.
- In phase 3, implement the DOLA protocol, allowing the assets on the PSC to circulate freely to other mainstream chains.
- Finally, our goal is to expand the liquidity of Polkadot ecosystem assets.
