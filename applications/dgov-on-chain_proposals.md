## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

With battle hardened experience from Edgeware, one of the most active proposal and governance system within the substrate ecosystem, we have developed some insight to improve the proposal process. The

Currently proposal platforms like Commonwealth enable off-chain proposals for communities, but they are a governance risk to a community, where the proposal history is stuck within a centralised off-chain system. 

 




If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

With battle hardened experience from Edgeware, one of the most active proposal and governance system within the substrate ecosystem, we have developed some insight to improve the proposal process.

Currently, off-chain governance and proposal platforms like Commonwealth enable a convenient option for communities. However, storing the entire historical proposal data on a centralised platform is a governance risk to communities who value sovereignty, as the proposal history is stuck within a centralised off-chain system. There is also no API for another team in the community to leverage the data, and make their own interface / tools, which forms an unecessary monopoly on the data. Proposals are also an essential part of a community, as it is the core records which unlocks funding from the treasury. The verification and preservation of this data is essential to just distribution of a cryptocurrency, and also in some cases justify inflation of the cryptocurrency to fund human endevour. 

Human interface and collective intellegince is stored in centralised servers. How can the mos timportant of our communications apparatus. 

Honoring of ongoing funding and proposal as evidence. 

The solution is DGov on-chain proposal system (first remarks, then pallets) and well documented and easy to use API. 

We will store key proposal data on-chain linked to IPFS, protecting the version history.

The API opens up access to other teams and platforms to use the data in useful ways that benefit the community. 


Secondly, proposals that unlock funding are an essential part of a and the feedback are essential part of a proposal process, the version history is something that should be preserved. 



Please provide the following:

- If the name of your project is not descriptive, a tag line (one sentence summary).
- A brief description of your project.
- An indication of how your project relates to / integrates into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

### Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about your project's expected final state. Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

- Mockups/designs of any UI components
- Data models / API specifications of the core functionality
- An overview of the technology stack to be used
- Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed
- PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic
- What your project is _not_ or will _not_ provide or implement
  - This is a place for you to manage expectations and to clarify any limitations that might not be obvious

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
- What need(s) does your project meet?
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - If so, how is your project different?
  - If not, are there similar projects in related ecosystems?

Joined the Edgeware community, and became a council memeber. I am technical steward for Kabocha parachain https://kabocha.network.

Interested in Education surrounding blockchain. Recently helped to get Substrate Recipes funded as it was a deprecated learning resource, but one that was very useful and many others in their success path in Substrate. 

Relevant previous (Web2) work includes building an API and spec for invoice factoring fintech https://docs.beansapi.com

## Development Status :open_book:

If you've already started implementing your project or it is part of a larger repository, please provide a link and a description of the code here. In any case, please provide some documentation on the research and other work you have conducted before applying. This could be:

- links to improvement proposals or [RFPs](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/rfp-proposal) (requests for proposal),
- academic publications relevant to the problem,
- links to your research diary, blog posts, articles, forum discussions or open GitHub issues,
- references to conversations you might have had related to this project with anyone from the Web3 Foundation,
- previous interface iterations, such as mock-ups and wireframes.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe _the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible_, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We _recommend_ that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.

For each milestone,

- make sure to include a specification of your software. _Treat it as a contract_; the level of detail must be enough to later verify that the software meets the specification.
- include the amount of funding requested _per milestone_.
- include documentation (tutorials, API specifications, architecture diagrams, whatever is appropriate) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to set up and run them.
- commit to providing Dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
- indicate milestone duration as well as number of full-time employees working on each milestone.
- **Deliverables 0a-0d are mandatory for all milestones**, and deliverable 0e at least for the last one. If you do not intend to deliver one of these, please state a reason in its specification (e.g. Milestone X is research oriented and as such there is no code to test).

> :zap: If any of your deliverables is based on somebody else's work, make sure you work and publish _under the terms of the license_ of the respective project and that you **highlight this fact in your milestone documentation** and in the source code if applicable! **Teams that submit others' work without attributing it will be immediately terminated.**

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Duration of the whole project (e.g. 2 months)
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  Average number of full-time employees working on the project throughout its duration (see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full-time_equivalent), e.g. 2 FTE)
- **Total Costs:** Requested amount in USD for the whole project (e.g. 12,000 USD). Note that the acceptance criteria and additional benefits vary depending on the [level](../README.md#level_slider-levels) of funding requested. This and the costs for each milestone need to be provided in USD; if the grant is paid out in Bitcoin, the amount will be calculated according to the exchange rate at the time of payment.
