## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

The ArtZero is a decentralized NFT marketplace on the Aleph Zero blockchain. It is the first NFT marketplace on Aleph Zero, allows everyone to Create, Buy, Bid, Sell, or just Collect Aleph Zero-based NFTs. The platform comes with its native Praying Mantis Predators NFT Collection, which NFT owners can stake for share of platform profit and other perks. ArtZero also provides a launchpad to let anyone to launch their NFT Collection.

Ink Whale lets stakers earn fixed interest and other rewards for locking up your tokens or NFTs. Unlike traditional yield farming, where you need to deposit tokens into a liquidity pool to get token rewards, NFT farming uses NFTs instead. The main goal of NFT farming is to create liquidity and utility for NFTs.

The Smart Contracts of ArtZero and Ink Whale use Ink! Substrate are currently working on Aleph Zero but the Smart Contracts can be deployed on any parachains that support Ink!

### Overview

### Project Details

After successful Grant Delivery of ArtZero and InkWhale as well as successful launch of NFT Marketplace ArtZer, we would like to bring both platform to the next upgrade. This phase will focus on the improvement of Ink Whale platform.

### Ecosystem Fit

SubWallet is our friend and partner, their office is literally 5 minutes from our office and we have collaborated on many things in the past. Our team helped SubWallet in the development of https://dotinsights.subwallet.app/ and also working with SubWallet to integrate Aleph Zero blockchain to their wallet.

Ink Smart Contract is very new, but our team has strong knowledge of development on Ink!. ArtZero is also one of the very first dapps developed on Ink Ecosystem.

In Nov 2022, we also received the bounty for find a serious bug in Substrate Ink! by Parity Security Team. The fix is at PR #11771.

In April 2023, we successfully launched our NFT Marketplace on Aleph Zero and Astar Network and the smart contracts work perfectly without any issue so far.

We believe that with our strong interest in Ink!, we can provide a lot of benefits to the ecosystem such as development training and supporting.

| 0b.    | Documentation      | We will provide technical documents and user guides |
| 0c.    | Testing Guide      | We will provide Test Plan and Test Results for operating and using the staking and yield farming platform as well as launchpad operation. |
| 0d.    | Article/Tutorial   | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work principle as part of the grant. |
| 1. | Smart Contract Development | We will require pool/farm creators to add liquidity to pay for reward at creation. Thus, it will reduce the adding liquidity step and stakers will always be guaranteed for rewards. The pool will also include the maximal number of staking amount that users can contribute. The platform will also contain a token launchpad, features include: creating new launchpad project with fixed fees pay in INW token; add sale phase and add whitelist to each phase; All collected fees will be burnt. |
| 2. | Backend | Adding more backend cronjobs for new features including: launchpad project monitoring; whitelist monitoring; minting history. |
| 3. | Frontend | Project creators can provide different information for the public to see such as Logo, images, social media, roadmap, team, sale phases. We will be adding the launchpad design into Figma design at https://www.figma.com/file/63xCCH71Oa8AfJpkK1wCO3/Ink-Whale?node-id=88%3A234. The current demo can be seen at https://testnet.inkwhale.net |
