## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

### **Swush: A Unified DEX Aggregator for Polkadot’s Cross-Chain Ecosystem**

**The Case for a DEX Aggregator**

As the cross-chain asset and network grows, users increasingly need efficient, cross-chain asset trading. Yet, within Polkadot’s ecosystem, users face several significant challenges:

- **Fragmented Liquidity:** Assets and liquidity are spread across Polkadot’s parachains like Hydration, Moonbeam and Asset Hub, making it difficult for users to find optimal trading routes and rates.
- **Complex Cross-Chain Transfers:** Users must navigate multiple interfaces and steps to perform cross-chain transactions, which discourages adoption and limits liquidity flow.
- **Underutilized Potential of Asset Hub:** Positioned as a central liquidity hub, the Asset Hub is ideally suited for cross-chain aggregation, but current solutions don’t fully capitalize on this potential.

A **DEX aggregator** directly addresses these issues by connecting to multiple decentralized exchanges (DEXs) and liquidity sources, allowing users to access the best swap rates, lowest fees, and minimal slippage for their trades. Within Polkadot, an aggregator can unify these scattered resources into a single, user-friendly interface, making DeFi more accessible and enhancing overall ecosystem liquidity.

### **Swush: A Solution Aligned with Polkadot’s Vision**

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/84090aea-7633-413f-a512-fe610388d50a" alt="Image description" width="960" height="580" />

**Swush** is a **DEX aggregator** built on Polkadot Asset Hub, specifically to meet the needs of Polkadot’s cross-chain DeFi users. By leveraging cross-chain messaging (XCM), and aggregating assets from multiple parachains, Swush allows users to swap assets seamlessly across the ecosystem with minimal friction.

Key features include:

- **Optimized Route Selection:** Real-time analysis of liquidity and fees ensures users receive the most cost-effective swap routes.
- **User-Friendly Cross-Chain Swaps:** A simplified interface abstracts complex cross-chain steps, making transfers straightforward.
- **Centralized Liquidity Access:** By aggregating from Polkadot’s Asset Hub and other parachains, swush maximizes the utility of existing liquidity pools.


### Ecosystem Fit

We published a initial research on current state of DEX aggregation and cross-chain transfers in ecosystem [here](https://www.notion.so/DEX-Aggregator-for-Asset-Hub-10ca0d44e13d8040ae48d2ec6f5f9a9a?pvs=21) .

**Why a DEX Aggregator matters to the Polkadot Ecosystem**

Our DEX aggregation thesis aligns closely with Rob's vision for the [evolution of AssetHub "Plaza"](https://www.rob.tech/blog/plaza/), where he emphasizes its current ability to scale to thousands of TPS, with even greater potential in the future. With [smart contract support](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/contracts-on-assethub-roadmap/9513) anticipated on Polkadot AssetHub by the end of December, we expect a surge in DApps and users. This growth will naturally create a demand for liquidity on AssetHub as these users and applications scale.

A similar success story can be seen with the Jupiter DEX aggregator on Solana, which has greatly improved trading efficiency by aggregating liquidity across multiple DEXs, offering users the best prices with minimal slippage. I’ve shared some [key statistics](https://www.notion.so/Jupiter-on-Solana-A-Success-Story-10da0d44e13d80aea29dc771f76b67a6?pvs=21) that demonstrate Jupiter's impact on Solana.

On a related note, cross-chain DEX solutions are gaining momentum. we recently came across a research paper by [LiquiSpell](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/blockchain/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2024.1413840/full), a novel protocol unifying liquidity across multiple parachains within the Polkadot ecosystem. Other cross-chain DEX solutions like [Chainflip](https://chainflip.io/) and [Squid router](https://www.squidrouter.com/) on the Axelar Network are designed to connect major blockchain networks like Ethereum, Layer 2s, Solana, and others. [Hyperbridge](https://hyperbridge.network/) is also seeing traction and indicate a growing interest in seamless cross-chain liquidity.

Teams like Velocity Labs are advancing AssetHub integration beyond the Polkadot ecosystem, focusing on areas such as CEXs, onramps, and oracles. Their recent announcement regarding [AssetHub integration for custodians](https://medium.com/velocity-labs/improving-user-experience-for-polkadot-assets-the-ultimate-guide-for-custodians-706800a540b6) is an encouraging development.

**Where and How swush Fits into the Polkadot Ecosystem**

Swush fits as a DEX aggregator on Polkadot Asset Hub, addressing the need for efficient, cross-chain asset swaps. By aggregating liquidity from various parachains and optimizing routes, swush  helps users access the most cost-effective and time-efficient paths for asset exchanges. This supports Polkadot’s vision of a unified, interoperable blockchain ecosystem by simplifying cross-chain DeFi activities.

 **Target Audience**

- **Primary Users:** General users in the Polkadot ecosystem looking for efficient asset swaps.
- **Developers & DApp Builders:** Parachain developers and dApp builders seeking cross-chain liquidity solutions for their own applications.
- **DeFi Traders:** DeFi users within the Polkadot and Kusama networks who rely on optimized routing for swaps to reduce costs and increase transaction efficiency.

 **Problem(s) Addressed**

As outlined in the **The Case for a DEX Aggregator,** Polkadot’s ecosystem faces challenges mentioned below. **Swush** tackles these issues with a clear, user-centric approach:

- **Liquidity Aggregation Across Parachains:** By unifying liquidity from Polkadot’s parachains like Hydration, Moonbeam, and Asset Hub, swush provides users with optimized, cross-chain trading routes and cost-effective swap rates.
- **Streamlined Cross-Chain Transactions:** swush simplifies complex multi-step transactions into a single, user-friendly interface, reducing friction and making cross-chain interactions accessible to all users.
- **Enhanced Utility for Asset Hub:** With its aggregation model, swush fully leverages the Asset Hub’s capacity, positioning it as a key liquidity hub and aligning with Polkadot’s vision of a unified, interoperable DeFi ecosystem.

 **Existing Similar Projects in Polkadot/Kusama**

A cross-chain DEX Aggregator doesn't exist yet in the ecosystem as per our research. While other DEXs exist in Polkadot, such as **Hydration** or **StellaSwap**, they focus more on liquidity pools and swaps within their ecosystems rather than a cross-chain aggregation solution.

 **Similar Projects in Other Ecosystems**

- **Jupiter(Solana)** : We published some key stats [here](https://www.notion.so/Jupiter-on-Solana-A-Success-Story-10da0d44e13d80aea29dc771f76b67a6?pvs=21).
- **1inch (Ethereum):** A popular DEX aggregator on Ethereum that uses liquidity aggregation and route optimization to lower swap costs.
- **Thorchain (Cross-Chain):** Focuses on native cross-chain asset swaps. Swush takes a similar approach but uses Polkadot’s cross-consensus messaging (XCM).

**The Case for Growth**

The success of our DEX aggregator is closely tied to the adoption and growth of the **Plaza** within the Polkadot ecosystem. For a DEX aggregator on Plaza to reach its full potential, it will require strong traction and active participation from various ecosystem players.

Several development teams have already expressed interest in building on Plaza, pending the launch of smart contract support, which will be essential for Plaza’s functionality. However, the immediate demand for a DEX aggregator will depend on Plaza’s initial adoption rate and traction among parachains and users.

## Future Plans

- **Long-term Maintenance and Development Funding:**
    - With our estimated budget, we plan for the platform to be self-sustainable for maintenance and further development until it achieves product-market fit (PMF).
    - Should we see significant user traction after Plaza’s full launch, especially with smart contract support, we will seek additional funding.
- **Short-term Strategy:**
    - Our initial focus is on a beautiful UX and strong branding to build user confidence in our platform. We recognize that trust-building will take time, as users may be cautious initially. To attract new users, we plan to launch NFTs and incentive programs that encourage engagement and usage.
- **Long-term Vision:**
    - Establish Swush as a trusted platform and cross-chain transaction hub for Polkadot.
    - Achieve self-sustainability through revenue streams such as trading fees. Since cross-chain transfers incur some fees, we’re also exploring additional revenue streams.
