<p>Fair Squares aims to co-create a more transparent and fair housing market for tenants, co-owners and social investors. In order to make rental housing more affordable and accessible to a larger group of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>A brief description of our project.</li>
</ul>
<p>Fair squares is a coordination framework for onboarding, financing and housing of real estate assets where affordability &amp; equitability are the guiding principles. It implements a return-on-rent model for the new fractional owners. The return-on-rent variable brings the investor and tenant in direct relationship, with a view to create the right balance to close the affordable housing gap. A group of individual investors, each bundling their capital to invest in a house that is for sale, get together with purpose to rent it out. Based on their individual fractional share of the house, their investment produces an acceptable yield, which is the social return-on-rent.</p>
<p>The purpose of this project is to stimulate affordable housing, through the use of a blockchain, while offering investors a similar return compared to other defensive investments. The blockchain runtime has the required modules to finance, onboard assets, bid, transact and rent out. These parameters are governed by the council and stakeholders that strive for a fair housing market.</p>
<p>To achieve the above, we rely on bringing assets on-chain and verifiable by real world actors that have the credentials to do so. By using Web3 technology in a semi-permissionless system for real-world assets, together with digital currencies and decision making tools, we can lower the barrier to entry to invest in the housing market and make it transparent and equitable for investors and renters.</p>
<ul>
<li>Integration into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.</li>
</ul>
<p>The substrate framework allows us to configure runtime to the custom needs to create a protocol that works to onboard assets and rent them out. The already open-sourced frame pallets and other teams building blocks are helping us to achieve our goal.</p>
<p>For our social mission to be successful, we require several actions on-chain, such as voting, selection of funds, governing and reccuring payments. We are looking to build a feeless parachain while getting the security from the relay-chain. We believe that the parachain functiunality collaboration is crucial to our mission by using other multi-chain services for DIDs, stablecoins and storage protocols within the substrate web3 ecosystem.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our motivation.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is exciting to see the rise of DeFi, the increasing TVL of liquidity, taking over traditional finance roles such as a market-maker, but not quite. We as a team, are users of these (DeFi) products and believe there is no turning back from this. Nevertheless, we are seeing the negative social economical consequences , collapsing protocols, or not being fully educated just because of a juicy return.</p>
<p>We want to focus on the blockchain technology that is equitable, no matter the time-frame you enter the blockchain, so you don&#x27;t have the feeling your missing out something.</p>
<p>Finally, our project will contribute to stop profit maximization on basic needs while striving to keep both ends of the supply and demand in balance. We strongly believe that the blockahin is the perfect technology to reconcile all stakeholders invovled in the social real-estate market, thus working to stregthen public good.</p>

<p>We are looking to develop a first usable version of the Fair squares node and interface: a fully rounded MVP that allows future users to use the core functions. We have been already coding on this since September 2021 on the code-base while participating to the APAC hackathon. We managed to reach parts of milestones 1 &amp; 2 by reusing parts of old archived substrate.dev codecase while adding our own logic on top.</p>
<p>Since then, we having been discussing what the modules and pallets are required to do to make this a working poiece of software. We ave created this type of <a href="https://youtu.be/_8mnawfNpBQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interface</a> that will be for <em>now</em> our front-end. In the last milestone, we are set to have a UI specialist on board.</p>

<!-- -->
<p>The <strong>techstack</strong> that is currently focused on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Substrate node, substrate pallets and customized pallets based on FS logic</li>
<li>Front-end template connected through WS,  Polkadot.js for testing specific features through the extrinsics.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are building this system so we can create a testnet and invite and educate the committed organizations, such as municipalities, housing coops and other important roles. We aim at co-creating simulations against current financing structures and trigger real user feedback.  We want to go first for a live testnet where further testing, experimenting and coordination can take place. This will give us the time to focus and iterate again after completion of all milestones.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">â€‹</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?</li>
</ul>
<p>Looking at Kusama &amp; Polkadot, there are more specialized parachains being onboarded that offer generic functionalities. We want to make use of these functions such as stable tokens, DIDs/ID, storage, privacy and messaging. We want to focus on creating a protocol and platform that focuses on solving affordable housing. It&#x27;s a very specific idea in the substrate ecosystem, it has a social good focus with coordination of funds and actions in which we can automate the flow in the runtime. The fit is in the usage of relay-chain security and using all the parachain connectivity while allowing our own custom logic for the Fair Squares solution.</p>
<ul>
<li>Who is your target audience ?</li>
</ul>
<p>The target audience for using the developed pallets are the end-users such as investors, sellers, verifiers, oracles. The current short-term goal is to further research, experiment and zero-in on our product/market fit. We are in talks with several institutions in the Netherlands that we rely on for further developing this concept to bring it in the longer term future to be a  functional application for affordable housing. Our goal is to get into a functional MVP that can handle a case and learn from the interactions. This will help us gather information about the limitations of interactions between FS blockchain and real-world processes, and devise additional solutions.</p>
<ul>
<li>What need(s) does your project meet?</li>
</ul>
<p>FS project focuses is on utilizing the available building blocks that are known in the  to make affordable housing possible with maximum as possible transparancy, while respecting pseudonimity of the users. The real world integration of blockchains are still minimal. We have payments for pyshical goods, but nothing really interacting with the real world, business and retailers. We believe that crypto systems implementation will look very different 5-10 years from now, we hope to kick-start that by focusing on a real-world problem. For now, the need is for the solution just to be functional enough to allow real-world testing, but combined with good token-design and fair distributions that give access to equitable systems for future users.</p>
<ul>
<li>Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not aware of any other projects that are focusing on housing and/or real estate in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem. This project is pretty unique in the web. There are however big parts of our design that are heavily inspired by the design of the governance layers in Kusama / Polkadot and PhragmÃ©n method for allocating funds in an asset. Outside of substrate based ecosystem, there are a couple of real estate projects, maybe the most notable being RealT, but it just focuses on the return of rental houses, where the LLC takes care of everything on the background and users just see their tokens and returns. We want to open this up fully and create an open transparent system while lowering housing costs.</p>

<p>The idea of Fair Squares and work has been existing for 2 years. We wrote a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uz_eTUKOcvjQu9R5zYNVJoF2KNGts7kW/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light-paper</a>(Mahir and Ilhan) to have a document and share it with similarly minded organisations. After publishing the light-paper, we decided to take part in a hackathon to get some exposure and experience and maybe get to know some other substrate enthousiast. The tech-team that stayed together after the APAC hackathon were Ilhan &amp; Kazu. We had limited experience in developing with Rust and Substrate. But we have come a long way since then and are comfortable in developing the below milestones with the team below. After finishing the hackathon we had a much more clear idea of what we needed in terms of skills. After the hackathon Stephen joined us. We are not seasoned system developers, this will reflect in the FTE en Amount asked in the rest of our proposal, but we are very eager to achieve the milestones presented and are confident we will.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Ilhan</strong>: has experience with different blockchain development architectures. During his time with the Blocklab.nl (a innovation arm /subsidiary of the Port Authorities in Rotterdam) he has created different applications for Energy and Supply-chains using a decentralized stack. He was also a part of the first cohort runtime developers academy. Active member in Kusama / Polkadot blockchains governance and validating.</li>
<li><strong>Kazu</strong>: Engineer in mechanical design at Fuji Electric. He started studying Rust in August 2021 and participated in 3 hackathons (2 with Polkadot and 1 with Phala) between August and November 2021. Most of what he has done can be found on <a href="https://github.com/ndkazu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub</a>.  The first original program written with Rust is demonstrated in this <a href="https://youtu.be/sMpUnaz_AiY" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a></li>
<li><strong>Stephen</strong>: Is a software engineer with experience mainly in .net environment, web app and desktop applications for different clients in banks, health and sport. He started to learn Rust in December with the objective to help concretize the project with his development skills according to the roadmap that we will define further.</li>
<li><strong>Mahir</strong>: is responsible for the market part of the FS research and the pilots with municipalities and other stakeholders. He is involved as an entrepreneur and consultant in various IT solutions such as <a href="https://www.unlocQed.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unlocQed</a> (honest recruitment) and works on <a href="https://weconomics.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Weconomics blockchain projects</a> and is responsible for research, design and valorization. Mahir is not taking part in the grants program as his contribution is not technical, but is vital part of the team for busuiness development.</li>
<li><strong>Thibaut</strong>: Thibaut will be focusing on th design and the front-end mainly in the last milestone. He brings 15+ years of experience in digital product design, user research, and product/market fit methodologies.</li>
<li><strong>Oliver</strong>: Software engineer with experience in web, desktop and mobile applications. Keen on competitive programming, very interested in analyzing and tackling with highly challenging technical problems.</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of the team together has only ideating and been working on Fair squares and has not applied for other Web3F grants.</p>

<li>We started of with publishing a <a href="https://fair-squares.nl/lightpaper/fair/squares/2021/09/14/english_whitepaper.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">light-paper</a>. To bring light to the problem and structure the idea. Suggestion 7 : We interviewed 4 employees from 3 organizations about these research questions in the light-paper that we thought needed to be enlightened. The link to the research results can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Y50h3JthlXBGSiG92eQP8MghSd4H07N8GKhO9d_nz7w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</li>
<li>We have presented our project at amsterDOT conference, the link for the video can be found <a href="https://youtu.be/rZdqHgn69wU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></li>
<li>We have discussed this project with several members of the polkadot community. We talked about it couple of times with Raul from the Polkadot community whether a treasury proposal would be good, we didn&#x27;t go for this as we saw a lot of parachain development projects to Kusama of Polkadot being rejected by the council. With the Square-one developments and close after amsterDot we believed further developing the idea with support from W3F grant was the next best step.</li>
<li>Our repo is in active development, but with the milestones we will create according to spec.</li>

The housing fund needs to have a getter for the <code>total_funds</code>. These storages will be used further in next modules for the selection of investors. The housing fund will bid for a house, if it has the funds to bid for an asset, so it also needs a function to allow the bidding mechanism to <code>reserve</code> and <code>transfer</code> the amount out of the housing fund and eventually is able to bid.

The housing council will be able to asses an asset and approve, reject, request more info. Creating custom calls for the housing council specific to asset information is crucial to determine the state of an asset onboarding. When approved the asset can continue to the investor voting. The <strong>investor-voting</strong> is randomly selected by their role. We can set a minimum of X investors to vote. They will vote from tehir POV whether the asset presented to them is worthy of investing. The investors don&#x27;t know with certainty that their capital will be allocated on the house their voting. It&#x27;s being voted from the POV that the housing fund will be used.

As additional work we can ping the voters through their discord or element ID  though when we need their on-chain voting power and decision making.

<p><strong>How did you hear about the Grants Program?</strong>
We have been around in the ecosystem for some time and we knew from the W3F grants program since it&#x27;s inception.</p>
<p>Work you have already done?</p>
<ul>
<li>We have all finished most of the substrate.dev tutorials and guides that are available. We are well aware of all usable pallets the tools and support places we can ask.</li>
<li>Since the amsterDOT some teams such as Acala have offered to also support technically and other ways. Before the amsterDot we were in talks with Litentry for the DID programme, this resulted in a technical chat with their runtime engineers that we can get technical support from, but the application is not continuing anymore because of a change in their structure.</li>
<li>We have regular meetings with the municipality of Groningen, the housing cooperationâ€™s and the lawyers with the objective to update them and spar about the project milestones. With the aim to build towards a case which with which we as a coalition want to experimentally prove the significant impact on the affordability of rental houses with Fair Squares, compared to the current (totally) free market situation. So parallel to the technical part, we are developing our current relationships, let the coalition grow by exchanging information, because we think this has at least the same importance as the node software, regarding to future (real situation tested) deployment aspirations we have. The current research partners are increasingly eager to add value to the process. Mainly because of the common values, the aspirations we share (solving the housing affordability problem), the progress they see in the project  and the fact that this process helps them to create a better radar for understanding the impact, risks and opportunities of the emerging web3 technology</li>
