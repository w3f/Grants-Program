## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

TON BRAINS and our founder (Mikhail Khokhlov) fully supports and Web3 Foundation philosophy with a deep vision of Polkadot and Kusama projects.

As result, we would like to host a mobile application (iOS, Android) ‘PolkaDot Brains’ for entry-level and experienced users to significantly expand the audience of Web3Foudnation and PolkaDot innovation in a decentralized universe.  

The app will contain all the latest information about Web3Foundation, Polkadot, and Kusama projects. The entry-level user would learn decentralized/blockchain technology from the ground where experienced users will have a puzzle of relevant technical information in their pockets all the time.

The app will educate and provide the latest material to Master PolkaDot’s knowledge. Tutorials, videos, code, etc.
