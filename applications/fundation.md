This is an excellent catch and a crucial detail for a technical grant application. I have updated the grant proposal to include explicit deliverables for the **Dockerfile** and the **GitHub MD files** (specifically `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md`), as well as ensuring the language consistently refers to the **Polkadot-API** usage.

Here is the revised and finalized grant application:

## Project Overview :page\_facing\_up:

**Tagline:** Build dApps Faster Than Ever. Accelerate Your Polkadot Projects with Fundation's Polkadot API Management, Robust Auth, and Modular Toolkit.

### Overview

**Project Description:**
**Fundation** is a modular, open-source framework that empowers developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) rapidly on the Polkadot ecosystem. It uses the **Polkadot-API** to provide abstracted, reusable components for authentication, asset management, and UI, significantly reducing development time.

**Integration with Polkadot/Kusama:**
Fundation is designed to simplify dApp development on top of Substrate-based chains, particularly **Asset Hub** and **rollups**, by providing a streamlined front-end layer that interacts directly with the network via **Polkadot-API**.

**Team's Motivation:**
The project addresses the recognized gap in front-end tooling within the Polkadot ecosystem, aiming to lower the entry barrier for indie developers, hackathon teams, and startups.

### Project Details

**Technology Stack:**

  * **Core Stack:** Next.js
  * **UI:** Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
  * **Database (Local):**SQLite
  * **API:** **Polkadot-API**

**PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic:**

  * **Website:** [https://www.fundation.dev/](https://www.fundation.dev/)
  * **MVP/Login Demo:** [https://www.fundation.dev/login](https://www.fundation.dev/login)


**What your project is *not* or will *not* provide or implement:**

  * Fundation is a **front-end development framework** and will not provide backend infrastructure services (e.g., decentralized storage, node hosting).
  * It will not include logic for the creation or deployment of **smart contracts**.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Need(s) does your project meet?**
The project aims to significantly **lower the barrier to entry** for new developers and provide an **80% faster development cycle** for experienced teams on Polkadot.

**Differentiation:**
Fundation is **fully open-source and self-hostable**, offering full control without vendor lock-in. Unlike EVM-centric tools, it is **Polkadot-native** and optimized for the Substrate architecture, focusing on Polkadot-API abstraction for key dApp functionalities.
