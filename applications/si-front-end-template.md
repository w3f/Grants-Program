- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 1



## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Our project seeks to elevate the user experience and design aesthetics of the  [substrate-front-end-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) by transitioning to [Material Design UI](https://m3.material.io/). With the growing emphasis on user-centric interfaces, the adoption of Material Design principles will not only enhance the visual appeal of Substrate but also streamline navigation and improve overall usability. This should enable developers to build more appealing application, without applying too much effort. By reimagining and implementing Material Design components, we aim to create a intuitive and responsive interface that aligns seamlessly with modern design standards. 
### Overview

This project aims to enhance the user experience of the [substrate-front-end-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) by migrating to Material Design UI, ensuring a visually appealing, intuitive, and modern interface that aligns with contemporary design standards.

### Project Details

The project scope encompasses a comprehensive overhaul of the Web3 Foundation's React [substrate-front-end-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template), focusing on the adoption of Material Design UI principles. This includes redesigning key user interface elements, such as navigation menus, buttons, forms, and overall layout, to align with the Material Design aesthetic. The scope also involves the development and integration of Material Design components and patterns, ensuring a cohesive and consistent user experience across the platform.

The project will leverage the latest technologies and frameworks compatible with React, such as Material-UI, to implement these design changes efficiently. Additionally, the scope involves rigorous testing to guarantee compatibility, responsiveness, and accessibility across various devices and browsers.  This project aims to not only meet the WEB3 Foundation's current needs but also establish a foundation for future scalability and adaptability to emerging web technologies.

### Ecosystem Fit

The proposed project to rewrite the [substrate-front-end-template](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/substrate-front-end-template) using Material Design UI has several implications for enabling developers to build better UI and benefiting the Substrate ecosystem.

1. **Enhanced User Experience**: By adopting Material Design principles, developers gain access to a well-established and user-tested set of design guidelines. 

2. **Accelerated Development**: Material Design provides developers with pre-designed components and styles. This accelerates development cycles, allowing developers to focus more on refining features and functionality rather than spending time on the nitty-gritty details of UI design.

3. **Responsive Design**: Material Design inherently encourages responsive design practices. This means the UI will adapt seamlessly to various screen sizes and devices, providing a consistent and user-friendly experience across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

4. **Accessibility Standards**: Material Design is designed with accessibility in mind, ensuring that the UI is usable by individuals with disabilities. 

5. **Community Support**: Material Design has a vast community of designers and developers contributing to its evolution. By aligning with this design language, developers can tap into a wealth of resources, forums, and libraries, fostering collaboration and knowledge exchange within the broader development community.

6. **Adoption and Attraction of Talent**: A modern, well-designed UI can make the Substrate ecosystem more attractive to developers and users. A visually appealing and user-friendly interface can play a crucial role in attracting new talent and encouraging adoption, thereby strengthening the Substrate ecosystem as a whole.
