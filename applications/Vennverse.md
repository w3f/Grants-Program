### Overview

Please provide the following:
- A brief description of the project.
We're working on a decentralised social media network that combines the best elements of Instagram, Tiktok, and Reddit, as well as a tip-based system that allows users to reward content creators directly with crypto. As a result, unlike centralized networks like Facebook and Twitter, activity on these platforms is stored in an irreversible way on a decentralized system that no central authority can administer or monitor.

There is also a Web3 based e-commerce store, like  Amazon, that implements crypto purchases that allow users to buy different products from books, electronics, clothing to footwear using their crypto all the payment is done on the Blockchain which allows users not just to use their cryptos for investment but also to buy different products with it that will in return increase the usability of Cryptocurrency globally as a currency to buy sell goods.

We've also introduced NFTs, as well as a marketplace where they can create and sell NFTs that aren't available on any other social networking sites. There will also be a flurry of blockchain-based games in which players may earn crypto and NFTS just by playing. As a result of these steps, our platform's engagement will increase, distinguishing us from other web2 social media sites.

Own Build & Trade Virtual Land 
we will also add An Expansive Metaverse to Play, Build, Own, and Monetize your virtual experience. after the initial launch of social media and here you can Own Land, Build and Play games, Earn on your creations. Be part of a Community.

In Vennverse, users have more authority and autonomy Because conventional social platforms place a premium on generating revenue, they have complete control over not just what users write, but also what they see. As a result, they show customers attention-getting advertising content, rather than educating them. Users on Vennverse, on the other hand, have complete freedom to link whatever they want because developers often just provide guiding parameters, leaving the rest to a distributed community of users. While reactionary and hostile remarks are discouraged, features encourage intelligent content, charity, and self-awareness. Because data is preserved on the Ethereum blockchain, Vennverse provides you genuine ownership of your online legacy. The data on the blockchain is open, decentralized, and unchangeable.


- An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project within the VeChain Ecosystem.
- If relevant, an indication of how you will integrate tools and features (e.g., Sync2/Connex, fee delegation protocols, MTT, etc) to enhance your project. 

How Vechain can help us
1) Multi-task Transaction (MTT)-Multi-function atomic transactions allow
2)Authority Masternode Operators, with the aligned interest in the development of VeChain ecosystem, maintain the VeChainThor protocol according to the Foundation's governance policy. PoA addresses enterprise' common concerns of inefficient upgrade and waste of energy.

## Development Roadmap 

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an <b>example roadmap</b>. For each milestone:

- Please indicate the milestone duration, workload in terms of full-time equivalent (FTE) and cost. 
- Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of details must be high enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
- Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
- Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
- Please commit to providing dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
