## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Bela Supernova and BitIns propose to develop a universal payment service for Polkadot ecosystem that supports private and confidential payments in relevant crypto currencies as well as real-time on-ramp for cash payments, that can convert fiat in to crypto “on the fly”.

On the current market a user has to set up his personal crypto wallet or even a few for buying and using crypto currencies or to set up smart-contracts in different blockchains. This seems too complicated for non-crypto inspired users, that hinders the mass development of crypto-assured services and also brings overheads for multiple transaction fees.

At the same time Bitins represents the simplest way to crypto that is currently available: a simple POS transaction or an SMS message are enough to purchase a coupon that is redeemable as Bitcoins. Through a partnership with Kraken exchange and leading Slovenian companies – Petrol and Telekom Slovenije, Bitins became a widely used ramp to crypto that doesn’t include the need for a crypto-wallet or even a banking account.

Vouchers or coupons remain a specific financial instrument that is regulated in a particular manner. Similar rules have evolved for limited digital payments, used by telecoms, FinTech startups and banks. Bitins was able to explore and integrate both opportunities into a unique platform.

While the current model is locally profitable and ready for internationalization, as it does provide both the maximal simplicity and services to unbanked/underbanked segments within a growing crypto market, we believe that additional work on the platform would facilitate this route and further enable the envisioned global expansion

### Project Details

![DOT coupons](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98888366/152210061-f2784234-6712-413f-8fe9-41ba0306f5cf.png)

Coupons are technically utility tokens by definition. While efficient by current centralized exchanged based standards, BSN together with Bitins sit on the opportunity to widely improve efficiency and reduce system complexity. Direct exchange of coupons to tokens does not only improve the efficiency of the system, but due to existing utility it complies with most legal frameworks by design.

While this is a robust and logical expansion of Bitins, probably the most lucrative route of further development lies within the future expansion of services on top of the token platform. While integration with existing DeFi systems is logical, there might be enough traction within the basic platform for the development of an own exchange/DeFi platform.

![Architecture](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/98888366/152210104-02b45847-25aa-4601-adc0-c27b65195349.png)

The system itself as it seen by BSN has five functional modules:
1.	Ink! smart contract, that executes all logic for cashflows and coupons operations;
2.	Centralized system management module for coupons generation, invalidation and financial management;
3.	Centralized user management module for new off-chain users: all-in-one service for wallet generation and immediate transaction;
4.	Management apps;
5.	User apps.

### Ecosystem Fit

The new proposed application will become an on-ramp for fiat currencies: a native or non-native token of choice would be issued/exchanged for fiat within coupon redemption. Some of anticipated ways of fiat-to-crypto exchange:
- issue a native stablecoin upon coupon redemption;
- on-line exchange of the coupon value for native Polkadot or parachain tokens (e.g. DOT, LINK, COMP etc.) or stablecoins like aUSD using Polkadex or other DEX projects in the ecosystem;
- on-line exchange of the coupon value for native assets from other blockchains like BTC using 3rd party EX like Kraken.

As the token natively represents the bridge from fiat to crypto it can also enable an integration with a DeFi/CeFi environment on top and development of the same further down the road: further parts of the project include developing of a payment widget, that can make a transaction to a target wallet with a crypto-currency of choice without even issuing a personal wallet – straight coupon-to-crypto payments.

Immediate benefits of the token system would be the integration with global FinTech platforms and NFT markets and potentially expansion of the coupon system to using coupon-issued stablecoins for all transactions.
The key benefits are:
- Enhance payment options for DeFi projects with a fiat-to-crypto ramp;
- Propose a reliable but private and confidential state of payment with crypto assets.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** 4 months
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):**  9 FTE
- **Total Costs:** 183,500 USD

### Milestone 1 — Design and development of an Ink! smart contract

- **Estimated duration:** 2 months
- **FTE:**  3 FTE
- **Costs:** 73,200 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can run our smart contract and send test transactions, which will show how the functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Liquidity pool management methods | We will create methods for keeping and managing main liquidity pool, withdraw/top-up assets from/to main liquidity pool (service provider's pool) |  
| 2. | Coupon data storage | We will create a method for storing issued and sold coupons in the smart contract |  
| 3. | Coupon registration | We will create a coupon registration method |  
| 4. | Coupon validation | We will create an algorithm for validation of a redeemable coupon using its public and private keys. Each coupon will have public and private keys: the public one will be stored in the smart contract and the private one will be known only to buyer/user from the entire coupon. The destination wallet address for the transaction will be signed by the private key so that no destination wallet spoofing could be done by scams. Smart contract will validate the coupon and the destination address with the public key, pushed to the contract by the management tools service. After validation of the coupon smart contract will transfer appropriate sum from the service provider’s pool to the specified wallet. |  
| 5. | Coupon liquidation | We will create a coupon burn method upon it’s redemption and corresponding transaction |  


### Milestone 2 — Design and development of system management tools

- **Estimated Duration:** 3 month
- **FTE:**  3,5 FTE
- **Costs:** 80,000 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| -----: | ----------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both **inline documentation** of the code and a basic **tutorial** that explains how a user can run our smart contract and send test transactions, which will show how the functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide, we will describe how to run these tests. |
| 0d. | Docker | We will provide a Dockerfile(s) that can be used to test all the functionality delivered with this milestone. |
| 1. | Coupon management tools | We will develop a coupon generation service and algorythms for coupons registration in the smart contract. Each coupon will consist of a public and a private key. Public keys will be delivered to the smart contract for operations. Private keys will be accessible only to buyers and will validate the transaction upon coupon redemption. Upon registration of a coupon in the smart contract the appropriate sum of tokens will be locked in the service provider’s pool as a collateral for the coupon balance |  
| 2. | Interest management tools | We will create an MVP for accounting of service provider's interest and it's withdrawal. DISCLAIMER: All tools for financial and sales management are not included in the MVP for this project. |  
| 3. | Buyer's web interface | We will develop UI for coupons' redemption for users that already have an existing wallet with non-zero balance. Validation of the coupon will be made straight by the smart contract with gas taken from user’s wallet. |  

### Milestone 3 — Testing, documentation, and MVP deployment  

- **Estimated Duration:** 1 month
- **FTE:**  2,5 FTE
- **Costs:** 30,300 USD

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |

## Future Plans

Above defined deliverables are just a start position for future development of the product – a unified platform for users for easiest exchange of their fiat assets to crypto and with a personal wallet that can be used for payments in the ecosystem without excessive transactions and gas fees. Also, this is going to be a service for sellers and service providers to add straight fiat-to-crypto payments to their apps and smart contracts. The easiest way to perform a reliable yet confidential way of payments.

Our future plans for the project:
- Design and development of seller’s API for on-line coupon codes delivery to a POS terminal upon sales. Development of service provider’s tools for financial management and accounting: fees and commissions management on both sides (seller fees and user coupon commissions), sales management (accounting for sent/sold/lost coupons for each seller).
- User app development for the new “off-chain” users that yet do not have a wallet: first coupon validation and redemption will be made with gas from service provider’s wallet and a new user’s wallet will be created immediately; smart contract will count this gas to the service prover’s commission.
- Developing a user’s mobile app for “on-the-fly” coupon redemption by scanning a QR-code on the coupon – private key will be coded with a QR-code;
- Develop APIs for buying coupons via SMS;
- Algorithmic stablecoin development for using as a native service asset;
- Payment widget and APIs development for straight coupon-to-crypto payments in 3rd party Dapps;
- Fiat off-ramp development: a converse coupon technology to withdraw cash on sales partners POS terminals;
- Development of service provider’s functional UI for managing assets pool and coupons with built-in CRM and sales management.
