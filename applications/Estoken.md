## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview
Estoken revolutionizes real estate investment by enabling fractional ownership through blockchain tokenization. Our platform leverages ERC-1155 tokens to ensure seamless trading, rental income distribution, and dividend payouts based on property value appreciation.

While we've developed our smart contracts in Solidity, we're strategically deploying on Polkadot to leverage its superior interoperability, scalability, and lower transaction costs. This hybrid approach combines Ethereum's mature smart contract ecosystem with Polkadot's next-generation blockchain infrastructure.

Our team is passionate about democratizing access to real estate investments. The high barriers to entry in traditional real estate markets exclude many potential investors, and we believe blockchain technology on Polkadot can solve this problem by enabling fractional ownership with enhanced cross-chain capabilities and reduced fees.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- **Ecosystem Fit?**  
  Estoken fits into Polkadot's ecosystem by bringing real-world assets (real estate) on-chain through Moonbeam, a Polkadot parachain that provides Ethereum compatibility. This allows us to leverage Solidity's mature ecosystem while benefiting from Polkadot's interoperability, security, and scalability.

- **Who is your target audience?**  
  Our primary audience includes real estate investors seeking liquidity, property owners looking to tokenize assets, and individuals wanting to invest in real estate with minimal capital. We also target Polkadot ecosystem participants looking for real-world asset exposure.

- **What need(s) does your project meet?**  
  - Bringing real-world assets to the Polkadot ecosystem  
  - Lowering barriers to real estate investment  
  - Increasing liquidity in real estate markets  
  - Providing transparent property investment tracking  
  - Automating rental income distribution  
  - Enabling cross-chain real estate investment opportunities  

- **How did you identify these needs? Please provide evidence in the form of (scientific) articles, forum discussions, case studies, or raw data.**  
  Research from the World Economic Forum indicates that over $280 trillion in real estate assets remain illiquid and inaccessible to most investors. Polkadot's ecosystem currently lacks significant real-world asset (RWA) projects, creating an opportunity for Estoken to fill this gap.
  [Research](https://polkadot.com/blog/polkadot-and-the-future-of-real-world-asset-tokenization) 
- **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**  
  While there are DeFi platforms in the Polkadot ecosystem, none specifically focus on real estate tokenization with automated rental income distribution and DAO governance. Centrifuge is working on general RWAs but doesn't have the specialized features for real estate that Estoken provides. Our implementation via Moonbeam brings a unique Ethereum-compatible solution to Polkadot.

- **Are there any projects similar to yours in related ecosystems?**  
  Projects like RealT (Ethereum) and Propy exist, but they face scalability issues and high gas fees on Ethereum. Estoken differentiates by deploying on Polkadot via Moonbeam, offering lower fees, cross-chain capabilities, and integration with Polkadot's growing DeFi ecosystem.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Web3 Foundation Website 

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

Estoken represents a significant addition to the Polkadot ecosystem by bringing real-world assets on-chain in a user-friendly, efficient manner. While our smart contracts are written in Solidity, our strategic decision to deploy on Polkadot via Moonbeam allows us to:

1. Leverage Ethereum's mature smart contract ecosystem while benefiting from Polkadot's superior infrastructure
2. Provide significantly lower transaction costs compared to Ethereum mainnet
3. Enable cross-chain functionality that's impossible on isolated blockchains
4. Tap into Polkadot's growing DeFi ecosystem for additional financial services
5. Future-proof our platform with Polkadot's scalable, upgradeable architecture


The integration of Chainlink oracles for property valuation and our automated dividend system based on property appreciation represents a novel approach to real estate investment that can showcase Polkadot's capabilities for real-world asset applications.

By supporting Estoken, the Web3 Foundation would be funding a project that brings significant real-world utility to the Polkadot ecosystem, potentially attracting traditional real estate investors and demonstrating blockchain's practical applications beyond speculative use cases.
