## Project Overview

### Overview

Primis Desktop provides a one-stop Web3 integrated client for the Polkadot ecosystem.


### Primis Web3 Desktop for Polkadot

**Primis Wallet**

Primis Desktop Wallet is the best tool to manage multi-chain assets on the Polkadot ecosystem, such as Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains. Asset management mainly includes digital/NFT assets checking, sending, receiving, and trading records on the Polkadot ecosystem.

 **P2P Chat**

Primis Desktop provides encrypted chat groups for Polkadot ecosystem users to discuss decentralized Gov2 governance and Proposal freely. ZK-Proof technology will be combined into Primis chat groups to offer more privacy and decentralized DAO governance space.

Primis Desktop could automatically create encrypted chat groups for Polkadot ecosystem DApps, each DApp has its own independent chat group.

**Subscribe**

Primis Desktop also is a place for users to subscribe to Polkadot decentralized notifications like EPNS. Initially, Primis Desktop will provide asset change notifications for Polkadot, Kusama, and other parachains. More on-chain DApps notifications to exploit in the future.


**Primis Web3 PNS Browser**

Primis Desktop will gestate a Chrome-compatible PNS browser for the Polkadot ecosystem, allowing Polkadot ecosystem users to access Web2 pages and interact with Web3 DApps freely. Primis Web3 PNS Browser supports Polkadot ecosystem PNS domains’ resolution and visit.


Unlike traditional browsers such as Chrome, Brave, and Web2 centralized Cloud Service, Primis Web3 PNS Browser is based on a data relay network, where access and application data are transmitted to clients or Primis terminals through a relay network of Primis nodes.

**DApp Self-Hosting Platform**

Primis Desktop provides the plug-in function. All DApps on the Polkadot ecosystem can integrate and deploy on the Primis relay node network and upgrade and confirm through the reliable connection contract in a smart contract to ensure applications’ security.

***
Due to being the first Web3 desktop, Primis will interact with Polkadot's Web3 Ecosystem and bring the brand-new desktop concept to web3 users of Polkadot.

All of our teammates truly believed in the Web3 Revolution! That's why we want to boot this Web3 project.

### Tech Stack


Supported Chains: Polkadot, Kusama, and other Parachains such as Acala, Astar, and Moonbeam.

Client language: Electron, React

Server language: Nodejs

P2P language: Golang


### Ecosystem Fit

Primis is the first blockchain project known as the web3 desktop. And we want to attract more other ecosystems' web3 users to Polkadot ECO. Since primis is based on the concept of Web3, it has strong relationships with the most famous web3 organization W3F, and must be born here.
