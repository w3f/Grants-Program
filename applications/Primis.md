## Project Overview

### Overview
Primis redefines the Web3 Desktop world. 

In here, a basic Web3 explorer will be provided. Primis integrates all Dapps in the Web3 world and interacts Dapps with blockchains through a simple operation interface. 


### Primis' Four Core Components
 *Primis Wallet*

Basic functions like managing Web3 wallet assets, showing NFT assets data, and offering other Dapp assets information. Primis Wallet also supports managing fortress assets based on ZK privacy technology.

 *P2P Communication Protocol*

The protocol supports Primis users to start P2P encrypted chats and create P2P encrypted group chats.

*Primis Web3 Node Explorer*

Users can freely surf in the Web2/Web3 world through Explorer, which is kernel compatible with Chrome. Also, a multi-page plug-in page function is provided.

 *Dapp Docking*

A plug-in function is available in Primis, and all Dapps can be integrated into Primis.

Upgrade and confirm Dapps through the reliable link in the smart contract to ensure applicationsâ€™ security.
***
Due to being the first web3 desktop, Primis will interact with Polkadot's Web3 Ecosystem and bring the brand-new desktop concept to web3 users of Polkadot.

All of our teammates truly believed in the Web3 Revolution! That's why we want to boot this web3 project.

### Project Details

More details about Primis Web3 Desktop are as follows.

Primis is not only a single running node, but also a data relay network, and can also be used as a dapp client. Application can host the front-end on the Primis node, or connect the server interface to the Primis node. Application data is transmitted to the client or Primis terminal through a relay network composed of Primis nodes.

Primis's node browser can extend different dapp applications, and the server or backend program can host the traffic entry on smart contract, thus getting rid of the shackles of fixed servers.

The network protocol that comes with the node can transmit data reliably and privately between different nodes. So that different services can be running in different ecosystems, including web sites, node browsers, DeFi application, GameFi entry, Social Network , etc.

The wallet function that comes with Primis provides multi-chain asset management and transaction capabilities, so that most applications can be run on the Primis desktop in the form of plug-ins, so as to achieve one ecosystem and one desktop. Even the ability of multiple ecosystems to one desktop.

### Ecosystem Fit

Primis is the first blockchain project known as the web3 desktop. And we want to attract more other ecosystems' web3 users to Polkadot ECO. Since primis is based on the concept of Web3, it has strong relationships with the most famous web3 organization W3F, and must be born here.
