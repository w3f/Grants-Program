## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

The Multichain Identity Indexer‚ÄîIdentics is a GraphQL service designed to streamline interaction with the Identity pallet that was initially on Relay-chain and now resides on People Chain. This service is specifically tailored to serve as a robust data layer for socially oriented dApps, leveraging the simplicity of GraphQL and REST API.

In the current landscape, developers face challenges interacting with Identity due to the complexity and time-consuming nature of querying an identity pallet for many accounts in parallel. The second problem is that historical data related to identities is stored on the Relay Chain, where real-time updates happen on the People Chain. Identics aims to address these challenges by providing a user-friendly GraphQL interface, thus reducing the time and effort required to query these assets.

The key advantages of Identics include its focus on ease of use, versatility for a broad range of use cases, and commitment to bringing People chain utilization and documentation closer to developers. Furthermore, Identics is an entirely decentralized, open-source solution that respects user privacy by not collecting user data.

By reducing the time required to query identities and providing a more development-friendly interface, Identics aims to foster the growth and development of the Web 3.0 ecosystem in Polkadot.

### Project Details

The Identics is a state-of-the-art infrastructure tool that addresses developers' challenges when querying identities from the chain. Currently, developers are limited to querying identities in batches from RPC nodes, which can be time-consuming and inefficient for customer-facing products. This limitation often results in long waiting times and heavy device data loads.

To overcome these challenges, we have developed the Identics. This tool leverages the power of GraphQL to provide a more efficient and user-friendly interface for developers. With the Identics, developers can easily query identity-related and build on top of the [identity pallet by Parity](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot-sdk/blob/master/substrate/frame/identity/src/lib.rs) that was migrated from Relay chain to People chain. This service opens up a wide range of potential use cases, such as having Polkadot-native "Name service" or empowering social apps like [dotmemo.xyz](dotmemo.xyz).

Recognizing that many web developers may have little experience with GraphQL, we will also build a REST API that can be easily imported into any existing project. This API simplifies interacting with identities in any programming, making it more accessible for developers of all skill levels.

The Identics uses TypeScript and leverages the Squid framework (ArrowSquid) for data processing. It interacts with a Postgres database and provides a GraphQL interface for querying data. The project structure includes directories for generated model/server definitions, server extensions, data type definitions, and mapping modules. It also uses environment variables defined in a .env file or supplied by a shell for configuration.

The project's goal is to allow developers to interact with identities as simply as possible, ensuring all tasks can be done quickly and without extended searching. We aim to reduce the time necessary to query identity-related data on the People chain, making it easier for developers to build innovative social decentralized apps.

#### Architecture üèó

The Identics architecture is designed with simplicity and efficiency, ensuring a seamless interaction with historical data from the relay chain and present data from the People chain.

At the core of our architecture is TypeScript, a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional types to the language. TypeScript ensures robustness and reliability in our codebase, allowing us to catch errors early in the development process and write more maintainable code.

To handle data processing, we leverage the ArrowSquid framework. ArrowSquid is a powerful tool that allows us to process and index blockchain data efficiently. It provides a set of utilities for defining and running data processing tasks, making handling complex requirements easier.

Our project interacts with a Postgres database, a powerful, open-source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language. Postgres provides us with the robustness, scalability, and performance we need to handle large amounts of data.

![arch-bg](https://ipfs.rmrk.link/ipfs/QmQCxRAsGX6iNTgGYsD9MAriVoBnMGyLPZx4BYzH9YmbUB)

On the architectural level, we have a few layers, as described in the picture above. We need to obtain the data for the correct function of our indexer. Identics combines the sqd.dev archive (the data lake) and RPC node for the new data. When the indexer obtains a new event, it is automatically processed by the batch processor, which selects the defined handler. As previously mentioned, we processed data stored in the Postgres DB.

erDiagram
    Identity ||--o{ SubIdentity : "has"
    Identity ||--o{ Username : "owns"
    Identity ||--o{ Judgement : "receives"
    Identity ||--o{ Event : "events"
    Identity ||--o| Username : "has_primary"
    Identity ||--o| Identity : "super_of"
```

To expose the data to clients, we provide a GraphQL interface. GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing those queries with our existing data. It allows clients to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, making it easier to evolve and enabling powerful developer tools.

The project structure is organized into several key directories. The 'src/generated' directory contains model/server definitions created by codegen. The 'src/server-extension' directory contains a module with custom type-graphql-based resolvers. The 'src/types' directory contains data type definitions for chain events and extrinsics created by typegen. The 'src/mappings' directory contains the mapping module. The 'lib' directory contains compiled js files, reflecting the structure of the 'src' directory.

Finally, the project configures environment variables, defined in a .env file or supplied by a shell. This approach allows us to easily manage and change the configuration without altering the codebase.

The second state-of-the-art is our REST API. REST API is currently the most popular way to interact with web services. Thanks to its agnostic nature, it can be easily imported into any existing project and used in any programming language. The REST looks like this: `GET /identities/${address}.`
We have decided to implement REST API via Hono and Typescript, which provides the highest versatility and works in any environment.

### Ecosystem Fit


The Identics is a crucial addition to the Polkadot and Polkadot SDK ecosystem. It addresses the challenges developers often encounter when building on top of runtime pallets, particularly when interacting with Identities. The Identics provides a comprehensive identity-oriented data solution, simplifying the development process and enhancing the efficiency of dApps within the ecosystem.

Furthermore, the Identics is designed to be versatile, supporting a wide range of use cases. Developers can also leverage our [sub-scaffold UI](https://github.com/kodadot/sub-scaffold) template to bootstrap their projects quickly. This template, a forkable Substrate dev stack focused on rapid product iterations, accelerates the development process and allows developers to focus on creating innovative and user-friendly dApps rather than getting bogged down in the initial setup.

Our target audience for this proposal includes Web3 projects and blockchain developers, whether they are just starting out or already established within the Polkadot and Polkadot SDK ecosystem. We believe the Identics can provide significant value to these developers, enabling them to build more efficient and user-friendly dApps like [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/).

Identities also play a significant role in social and user-facing apps like [KodaDot](https://kodadot.xyz/) NFT marketplace, which could leverage Identics instead of their off-chain-based solution (profiles). Thanks to that, developers can find real-world examples of effectively making GraphQL queries and learn more about using Identics.

Regarding competition within the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem, the Identics differentiates itself through its focus on identity-oriented data solutions, user-friendly interface, and commitment to simplifying the development process. Including the REST API further sets it apart, providing developers with a ready-to-use foundation for their projects. Moreover, the Identics will be being utilized by [KodaDot](https://x.com/kodadot) and [.memo](http://x.com/polkadotmemo), demonstrating its practical application and effectiveness. We plan to further promote the indexer within the ecosystem to onboard new developers and explore new solutions. Additionally, Open-Gov services do not need to rely on custom APIs and implementations when they can use Identics to query data from the chain. These factors position the Identics as a unique and valuable tool within the Polkadot and Substrate SDK ecosystem, ultimately serving as a Common Good solution.

## Development Status :open_book:

We have initialized the [vikiival/identics](https://github.com/vikiival/identics) repository with sqd.dev and configured connections to the Polkadot network and People chain. As mentioned, we have drafted an initial schema for GraphQL as it will be a base point of our development. All tasks related to the development are tracked in [github.com/vikiival/identics/1](https://github.com/vikiival/identics/milestone/1) - Milestone 1 track.

Regarding the research, we have observed 3 points of interest:
1. [related past and present identity issues on Kodadot](https://github.com/kodadot/nft-gallery/issues?page=4&q=is%3Aissue+identity+is%3Aclosed)‚ÄîWe have identified that Identics would be a perfect fit for Kodadot as it would allow users to query user data from the chain and display it in the UI.
2. We have also identified that [SubIdentity](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/SubIdentity.md) was an original project to have all-in-one solution for identity on Polkadot. However, based on the research we have conducted [their repo seems to have had yet to have activity for the past 3+ years](https://github.com/Shard-Labs/identity-hub/tree/main). Moreover, the SubIdentiy has used old technologies and is incompatible with the current Polkadot ecosystem. SQD.dev is flexible enough to handle future changes in the Polkadot ecosystem.
3. To ensure we did not miss any crucial points, We have researched how [identity migration was handled](https://hackmd.io/@vikiival/dot-identities).
