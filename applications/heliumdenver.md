## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- HeliumDenver is a hackathon and exposition
- A Colorado based eventspace, hackathon, and expo, to educate, celebrate and grow the Helium network.
- Our project will help grow the open source community and help bridge protocol gaps and create interoperability 
- We've been in the Helium space for 3 years, learned development concepts we'd like to share, and are allocating funds for hackathon prizes.

### Project Details

- We are in a development stage and don't have a history to leverage here. We are enthusastic to help share the connections we've made at Helium Foundation, Nova Labs, Solana Foundation, and more, in order to bring new developers in the fold in order to bring their dreams to life.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

- Does it have to apply to existing niches or can we facilitate a new niche?
- Target audience- beginner programmers, developers, web3 users, IOT enthusiasts, general public
- What need(s) does your project meet? **Education! Safety! Amplification!**
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  - ETHDenver is similar but they are dedicated to their echo-chamber and not flexible toward growth

## Development Status :open_book:

WIP- We do not currently have any code base but intend to amass a wealth of open-source projects as a result of our open-source hackathons.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

We have received our first event grant from Helium Foundation, and have applied to Solana Foundation for an event grant as well. We will need to acquire funding to make the event a success, and future events will be dictated by the success of previous events. Our goal is to grow.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:** Ad-infinitum, monthly meetups each month, yearly hackathon each year, forever.
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 1
- **Total Costs:** $10,000

## Future Plans

We would like to employ teams to assist with orchestration. We will eventually have an IOT crypto arcade, catering, live music performances, educational workshops, competitive hackathons, and more. Our goal is to continue to evolve to meet the needs of the community and provide a memorable user experience for developers and visitors alike. We eagerly want to bring into the fold a world of new developers who may not realize they've got the potential to bring their ideas to life.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** Google searching grants for community-good and open source projects

Here you can also add any additional information that you think is relevant to this application but isn't part of it already, such as:

- I built the MNTD. tech support website and wrote all the documents after becoming enveloped in the Helium ecosystem. I came from a no-code background and have learned C++ to program my own IoT sensors, Python, Rust, Erlang, Typscript, HTML, React and more. Through this journey I've discovered what I didn't know was my biggest shortcoming. Learning what I didn't know allowed me to explore and become a developer of my own. This is a path I encourage others to take.
