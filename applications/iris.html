It aims to provide infrastructure for parachains, allowing nodes to securely store data assets offchain through Iris while access to that data is managed in the parachain. We envision that this chain can facilitate a myriad of decentralized applications that are not currently feasible, for example dropbox-like applications, pay-as-you-go streaming services, data marketplaces, and much more.</p><p>This goal is conceptually achieved by disseminating and resolving the barriers to adoption of decentralized storage and by contrasting with features provided by centralized services. Decentralized storage networks and blockchains generally do not provide more than storage, forgoing the higher-level capabilities available in a traditional centralized system. The greater the decentralization of the network, the less secure or private your data is. In contrast to centralized services, decentralized services are generally not privacy preserving, since any data on chain is by default public, so enabling privacy usually takes the form of some centralized service. A key feature of Iris is that file data is <em>never</em> stored on chain.</p><p>The major differences between DHT-based decentralized storage (using IPFS since it is commonly the DHT platform used as a basis) and centralized storage can be stated as:</p><p>1) <strong>Indexability</strong>: IPFS is not a search engine and is not intended to act as one. There is not an easy way to identify or track data in IPFS without a CID.</p><p>2) <strong>Security</strong>: When data is hosted in a decentralized network it is available to any node in the network. There are no permissions and no encryption.</p><p>3) <strong>Availability</strong>: Availability of any CID in the network is not guaranteed, and approaches to ensuring it is are not necessarily decentralized.</p><p>4) <strong>Governance</strong>: There are no native governance options and no simple way to purge data from all nodes in the network. IPFS provides a customizable blockList, but attempting to “revoke” data from other nodes is not fundamentally doable. If the IPFS network is public and truly decentralized, then this could allow for malicious content to exist in the network.</p><p>Inspired by work done by a team at <a href="https://github.com/rs-ipfs/substrate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">equilibrium</a>, the core of this project relies on embedding an IPFS instance within the Substrate runtime. This foundation ensures that calls to IPFS are made through the Substrate layer, specifically by offchain workers, allowing the DHT status to be accounted for on-chain. Iris functions in conjunction with parachains by allowing nodes to store data within Iris and monetize access to that data within their parachain, providing parachain node&#x27;s the ability to store, sell, share, buy, and monetize access to their data while still using their own native tokens and governance (retaining sovereignty).</p><p>Owned data is treated as a unique asset class within the blockchain, while access to the data is controlled by an asset minted from the asset class. Accounts that hold a positive balance of an asset are authorized to access the underlying data that the asset class is associated with. Iris will also have the capability to transfer assets between parachains and smart contracts (via XCM), enabling a novel way to access data across the web.</p><p>Additionally, this proposal lays the foundations for a governance framework that lets us block or purge data or accounts from participating in the network and achieve a from of decentralized moderation.</p><p>This proposal intends to deliver the iris blockchain, which includes integration of ipfs into the substrate runtime, building the iris pallet for storage and governance, and delivering a decentralized application in the form of a smart contract on the Iris blockchain. A minimal configuration may look like:</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/iridium-labs/Grants-Program/blob/iris/src/runtime_modules.png" alt="sample-runtime-diagram" class="img_ev3q"></p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="tech-stack">Tech Stack<a href="#tech-stack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Tech Stack" title="Direct link to Tech Stack">​</a></h4><p>Front End</p><ul><li>Javascript</li><li>React</li><li>Polkadot.js</li><li>js-ipfs</li></ul><p>Blockchain</p><ul><li>rust</li><li>Substrate</li><li>rust-ipfs</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-iris-blockchain">The Iris Blockchain<a href="#the-iris-blockchain" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to The Iris Blockchain" title="Direct link to The Iris Blockchain">​</a></h3><p><em>We delegate the explanation of the usage of embedded IPFS in the runtime to <a href="https://github.com/rs-ipfs/substrate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/rs-ipfs/substrate</a>.</em></p><p>At the most basic level, the runtime works by exposing a set of <strong>DataCommands</strong> that are prioritized in a queue for processing by offchain workers. Valid commands are consumed from the queue and processed by OCWs (of validator nodes only). Ingestion and ejection of data from the network occurs without the risk of onchain exposure.</p><p>Initally, Iris will be a Proof of Authority network, with only validator nodes capable of executing write operations to their node (such as adding data or inserting pins). However, all nodes run an embedded IPFS instance and can make read operations when authorized through Iris.</p><p>Iris delivers two modules, Iris-Assets and Iris-Session, which depends on the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/blob/master/frame/assets/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Assets Pallet</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/session" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Session pallet</a>, respectively. These two pallets work in tandem to provide full functionality to inject and eject data from Iris, create and manage asset classes, mint assets, and accept new validators into the network.</p><p>The <a href="/Grants-Program/applications/pallet_iris_assets.md">Iris-Assets</a> pallet provides functionality for nodes to inject data into Iris, create and manage storage asset classes and to mint and burn assets.</p><p>The <a href="/Grants-Program/applications/pallet_iris_session.md">Iris-Session</a> pallet provides session-based storage capabilities for network validators as well as enables ejecting data from the network. The iris-session pallet contains all functionality to interact with the embedded IPFS node. This is only needed for potential validator nodes, whose responsibilities are distinct from capabilities of data consumer and data owner nodes.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="creating-owned-data">Creating owned Data<a href="#creating-owned-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Creating owned Data" title="Direct link to Creating owned Data">​</a></h4><p>We introduce a permissionless function to allow nodes to request that data be ingested into Iris. We provide an extrinsic, <code>create</code>, which accepts a MultiAddr and CID and encodes it as a command in runtime storage. The offchain workers of Iris validators process the command and publish the results onchain. After the transaction is validated, the new CID, along with ownership, is encoded into runtime storage by creating a new asset class owned by the original caller of the extrinsic.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://github.com/iridium-labs/Grants-Program/blob/iris/src/data_ingestion.png" alt="ingestion" class="img_ev3q"></p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="storing-pinning-data">Storing (Pinning) Data<a href="#storing-pinning-data" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Storing (Pinning) Data" title="Direct link to Storing (Pinning) Data">​</a></h4><p>Iris is a proof of authority network. For the scope of this proposal we are proceeding with &quot;proof of storage potential&quot;. The Iris-Session pallet allows network authorities to add more authorities to the network. Only validators have the capability to interact with the embedded IPFS nodes, and thus to interact with the underlying IPFS swarm. Additionally, we introduce a <em>naive</em> mechanism through which validators earn reward points for storing <em>valuable</em> data. In the future, we would like to proceed with aa more sophisticated conesensus mechanism. The value of raw data is directly correlated to how many times it is accessed during a session. Reward points are rewarded to nodes who:</p><ul><li>1 point: add data to Iris (ipfs add CID). This reward is given to all nodes with capacity to add the data to their node.</li><li>2: points: pin some data (ipfs pin  CID). This reward is given to some individual node.</li><li>1 point: indirectly, when a node requests to read a CID from the network (ipfs get CID) when the validator is pinning that CID. This reward is given to all nodes who are storing the data.</li></ul><p>To incentivize validators to pin data to their nodes, we suspend any validator that has been online for 5 sessions but have not earned at least one point during each session.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-availability">Data Availability<a href="#data-availability" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Availability" title="Direct link to Data Availability">​</a></h4><p>Iris does not ensure that data is available 24/7. Rather, validator nodes prioritize data by ensuring storage based on the value of the data, which we simply determine based on the number of times that it was accessed by data consumers during some period of time (a session in which a validator set  is active). Validators may choose to not store data whose value is too low. However, for the scope of this proposal validators earn no incentive for pinning content.</p><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-access-and-retrieval">Data Access and Retrieval<a href="#data-access-and-retrieval" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Access and Retrieval" title="Direct link to Data Access and Retrieval">​</a></h4><p>To eject (a copy of) data from the network, authorized nodes in parachains invoke the <code>request_bytes</code> extrinsic, providing the asset id and its owner as arguments.

Due to the importance of this topic, we mention it here.</p><p>Due to the nature of decentralization, there is a wide berth for potential abuse of the network. Particularly, for a storage network, this could manifest as leveraging the network to store or share illegal or abusive content (e.g. hate speech). In order to counteract this, Iris lets nodes report or flag content through an extrinsic, providing a cid, multiaddr, as well as a reason for reporting the content. When certain conditions are met, nodes who hold the content are incentivized to remove it from their IPFS node and punished if they do not.</p><p>Iris has two flavors of governance: Data governance (moderation) as well as membership governance.</p><ul><li>content governance<ul><li>remove/purge data</li><li>block CIDs from entering the network</li></ul></li><li>self-governance<ul><li>block addresses</li><li>block validators/ipfs nodes from participating in iris</li><li>accept new validators</li></ul></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-structures">Data Structures<a href="#data-structures" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Structures" title="Direct link to Data Structures">​</a></h4><p>Many of the data structures we use are the same ones defined in <a href="https://github.com/rs-ipfs/substrate" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rust-ipfs/substrate</a>, so we omit them and only discuss new structures.</p><p><strong>Asset Class and Assets</strong>

We have a PoC to showcase some of the early developments. The user interface can invoke an extrinsic, passing it a filename and file content, and in turn adds the data to IPFS by calling an OCW which submits a signed transaction. This signed transaction calls an extrinsic that encodes the CID and filename within a storage map.

We intend to be able to provide end to end testing scenarios in which a node adds owned data, purchases access to owned data, and retrieves it. We also introduce the idea of the &quot;ticket&quot; to control access to data as well as functionality to verify tickets when processing requests to deliver data.</p><table><thead><tr><th align="right">Number</th><th>Deliverable</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="right">0a.</td><td>License</td><td>Apache 2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="right">0b.</td><td>Documentation</td><td>We will provide both <strong>inline documentation</strong> of the code and a basic <strong>tutorial</strong> that explains how a user can setup an Iris node, join the private network, and provide storage capacity.</td></tr><tr><td align="right">0c.</td><td>Testing Guide</td><td>Core functions will be fully covered by unit tests to ensure functionality and robustness.

The outcome is for nodes to be able to create owned data and to monetize access to that data via the ticket asset.

The &quot;data-owner/consumer&quot; view swallows the of the functionality built in milestone 1 as well.
