# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Game Economy for Kusama Ecosystem
* **Team Name:** Realis
* **Payment Address:** 1LSnwf4sLiPX6TbCPE5a5QYVbQ5f2jvDjx

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
At Realis Network, we aim to break down the boundaries between the user and the company. We are creating a fair system of value distribution and building a new gaming concept, combining all the important components we will connect them through blockchain technology.Realis focused on the conventional gaming market and our goal is to connect games with the real world. By using web3 tools we enable the player to dive deeper into the gameplay through additional features and values. Ring of Legends doesn't require players tohave blockchain or cryptocurrency skills. Step-by-step we gradually teach players how to use blockchain. Our players will simply play the game, and we'll let them become a part of the ecosystem, own their personal assets, in-game currency and NFT items, receive a portion of the revenue from the network cash flow, make suggestions, vote and make decisions.We aim to unlock the full potential of the blockchain economy through games, abstracting its complexity from users.

The mobile market is the most popular and promising in terms of adoption and user engagement.The analytics platform App Annie estimates that in 2020, games accounted for 72% of mobile market’s revenue. In total, users spent $112 billion on mobile apps, $81 billion of which was spent on games.In terms of downloads, games account for 40% of all mobile app downloads in 2020, or 53 out of 130 billion downloads.The increase in mobile gaming revenue will continue to outpace the growth in PC gaming revenue next year, eventually reducing the PC gaming market share to 20% in 2022. In addition, mobile game revenue also outpaces console game revenue.In 2021, Newzoo predicts that PC games will account for no more than 20% of market revenue, console games –no more than 30%, and mobile devices and tablets will account for 46% or more. By 2022, mobile and tablet games will account for about 50% of the entire gaming market.

### Overview

  * Realis Network.

  * Realis is a project that combines all the best ideas of the traditional gaming world with the integration of blockchain, Defi and NFT components.Our goal is to connect game economy with real world where users will be fully involved and become full owners of the platform and the games they play.We strive to provide players with the most immersive and enjoyable gaming experience possible.

  * We are a realis project that creates a hybrid platform for the implementation of mobile games with the integration of blockchain technologies for a mass audience, we strive to combine blockchain and games using polkodat technologies and implementing nft logic on their basis, uniting the economy using a tokenized game currency, using defi ideas, we will build a partially decentralized ecosystem where the players themselves will own the projects they play and control their future for the kusama ecosystem, we can become a unique project, we will be able to attract a large number of users from the mobile games market, train and teach them how to use blockchain and cryptocurrencies.
  
   People love to play games. Someone just gets pleasure after a hard day at work or at university, someone is trying to achieve results and pursues a sports interest. Players are a large community with different ideas and goals. Almost every person has a phone, many people contribute to games in order to achieve results faster, we want people to be able to use their own investments, they can regulate the cost of NFT-Token themselves, and also regulate any cryptocurrency located in the Kusama ecosystem. In most games, the in-game currency does not mean anything, we want the purchases made in the game to be more meaningful.
  - people shop in games
- game currency has no value outside the game except for a couple of games
- we offer a solution to this problem using blockchain technologies
- for a simple player there will be no differences from a regular game without valuable game currency
- nft tokens will be in-game items that enhance or change the appearance of a character, players themselves will form the value of tokens due to nft exchange and market rules

  * The Mobile MOBA genre is the most memorable and popular game mode in the world. Using a unique concept that brings together the best ideas of the gaming world and the world of blockchain, Ring of Legends will become competitive in the mobile games market, and we will be able to attract a huge number of players and interest them in using the Kusama ecosystem. share of users from similar games.

### Project Details 

Ring of Legends is a MOBA game where two teams of players fight against each other on a special map. 
Each player controls one character from a list of available heroes with different characteristics and abilities.Ring of Legends combines the best of both worlds –the excitement of MOBA for ordinaryplayers, and an ecosystem where each user can own, manage, collect, trade tokenized in-game currency, and create NFT, even if they have no idea about blockchain and NFT.
Ring of Legends is a game for ordinary gamers who are used to have fun and enjoy the gameplay. We will smoothly teach them how to use blockchain and NFT step-by-step in a training mode.
The mobile market is the most popular and promising in terms of adoption and user engagement.The analytics platform App Annie estimates that in 2020, games accounted for 72% of mobile market’s revenue. In total, users spent $112 billion on mobile apps, $81 billion of which was spent on games.In terms of downloads, games account for 40% of all mobile app downloads in 2020, or 53 out of 130 billion downloads.The increase in mobile gaming revenue will continue to outpace the growth in PC gaming revenue next year, eventually reducing the PC gaming market share to 20% in 2022.

* Realis Node is a custom chain node for building a Realis network with Substrate 3.0, it contains basic functionality like a normal chain node, but also provides the ability to fetch external data needed for games.
* Also, we want to develop a pallet for nft staking. It will be possible to steak only nft with certain types (silver, gold, diamond). Each user will be able to have nft data, they can fall out of loot boxes, or they can be bought from another user, exchanged for other nft

### Documentation of core components
* Realis Token GOLD is the native token of the Realis Network, and it will play the role of governance and other utilities. GOLD like KSM

* REALIS-API: API for linking the game with the blockchain (transfer operations, creating, crafting, transfer of NFT-Token, withdrawal of funds when the user spends)

* NFT-Token: Own, open to other developers, NFT pallet

* NFT-Marketplace: Marketplace embedded in the NFT trading game

* Bridge Substrate to ERC721: Bridge for transfer from blockchain substratum to Etherium contract

### Relevant prior work
* In Realis we know what players want and we understand the audience of our product. We understand what attracts them in the games, we have experience in building a working business model and by combining it with Defi and NFT economics we can create a unique and popular product in the market.

### Ecosystem Fit 

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Our project is directly related to gaming and E-sport, we also plan to provide a platform for the exchange and sale of in-game NFT-Tokens.
* First of all, the project is aimed at the audience of gamers. We also hope to become an attractive platform for other blockchain developers.
* At present, there is no real decentralized game platform, but more decentralized games. Unlike the past, this time we are going to build a truly decentralized game ecological platform.
