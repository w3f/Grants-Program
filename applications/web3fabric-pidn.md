## Description
"Empowering developers to revolutionize cross-chain innovation—Polkadot-first, one-command multi-ecosystem devnets for seamless testing and prototyping."

The Polkadot Interop Devnet (PIDN) will make Polkadot the natural hub for multi-chain development. With a single command, developers will be able to spin up a local or CI-ready relay chain + parachains alongside optional Cosmos zones, Ethereum clients, Solana validators, and Bitcoin nodes, plus preconfigured bridges (e.g., Snowbridge, Axelar, Wormhole).

PIDN will provide a unified CLI and API to orchestrate networks, automate XCM/relayer flows, enable AI-assisted troubleshooting, and deliver benchmarking for finality, latency, and throughput. By collapsing setup time from weeks to minutes, it will allow developers to focus on application logic rather than infrastructure, accelerating the creation of interoperability-native applications.

PIDN is designed to make Polkadot the default starting point for cross-chain development:
- Every devnet will begin with a Polkadot relay chain and parachains at the core, with other ecosystems optionally layered on.
- XCM testing and benchmarking will be first-class features, positioning Polkadot as the control plane for interoperability.
- By providing a production-like environment where both human and AI developers can build, test, and rerun workflows, PIDN will turn Polkadot's interoperability promise into an accessible developer advantage.

In short, PIDN will transform Polkadot from the ecosystem with the strongest interoperability technology into the ecosystem where interoperability is the easiest to build.

# Project Details

The cross-chain development ecosystem faces a critical bottleneck: while Polkadot offers the most advanced interoperability technology, developers today spend weeks on infrastructure setup before writing their first line of application code. This friction risks pushing builders toward simpler but less capable ecosystems, leaving Polkadot's technical advantages unrealized.

## Fragmented Tooling Landscape
Multi-chain development currently lacks unified tooling. Each ecosystem provides partial solutions — Zombienet for Polkadot, Cosmos testnets, Solana local validators — but these remain siloed, focus on single ecosystems, and often emulate rather than reproduce production behavior. Production bridges like Snowbridge or Wormhole enable live connectivity but offer no safe environment for iteration and debugging. The result: interoperability exists in theory but remains inaccessible in practice.

## Developer Experience Crisis
Building cross-chain apps today requires developers to become DevOps experts first. Configuring relay chains, parachains, HRMP channels, and bridges manually is complex, error-prone, and distracts teams from innovation. Even after setup, what works locally often fails in production, slowing time-to-market.

PIDN will remove this friction by:
- Running real nodes and bridges in production-like conditions, not lightweight emulations.
- Providing a one-command, Polkadot-first devnet that extends to Cosmos, Ethereum, Solana, and Bitcoin.
- Offering a unified CLI and SDK with integrated troubleshooting, benchmarking, and CI/CD support.

This will reduce setup time from weeks to minutes, while delivering both:
- **Technical reliability**: multi-chain orchestration, comprehensive testing, performance benchmarking.
- **Developer accessibility**: simple commands, clear documentation, and AI-assisted troubleshooting.

With PIDN, Polkadot will become the natural choice for teams building interoperability-native applications.

## Competitive Analysis

| Existing Tool / Approach | Strengths | Gaps for Cross-Chain Builders |
|---------------------------|-----------|--------------------------------|
| Zombienet (Polkadot) | Gold-standard for testing Substrate chains; CI integration. | Limited to Polkadot/Substrate only. No Cosmos/EVM/Solana support. Emulates flows instead of running production-like nodes. No bridge testing. |
| Cosmos Testnets + Hermes Relayer | Native IBC testing for Cosmos app-chains. | Cosmos-only. No unified interface with Polkadot/EVM. Setup is heavy, no cross-ecosystem orchestration. |
| Solana Local Validator | Quick simulation of Solana environment. | Solana-only, no bridge/XCM integration, minimal orchestration. |
| Manual DevOps Setups | Closest to production if done by hand. | Requires weeks of config + DevOps expertise. Not reproducible, unsuitable for CI/CD. |
| Production Bridges (Snowbridge, Axelar, Wormhole, etc.) | Battle-tested mainnet connectivity. | No dev/test environments. Heavy and costly. Only validate live flows, not developer iteration. |

All current tools address single-ecosystem needs or final mainnet connectivity. None provide a Polkadot-first, multi-ecosystem devnet that mirrors production, supports CI/CD, and is simple enough for everyday developers. PIDN will fill this critical gap, becoming the first true interoperability-native developer platform.

## Market Opportunity

The cross-chain ecosystem is at an inflection point. Over 200 parachain projects are registered on Polkadot/Kusama, and more than 23,600 Web3 developers are actively building worldwide (Electric Capital, 2024). Yet most still spend weeks on setup before writing application code — friction that pushes talent toward simpler but less capable ecosystems.

Meanwhile, interoperability protocols are one of Web3's fastest-growing segments, with adoption rising 200–300% year-over-year. Enterprises, parachain teams, and dapp developers are eager to launch cross-chain products, but today's tooling is fragmented, ecosystem-siloed, and error-prone.

The rise of AI-assisted development makes this need even sharper. AI copilots and agents can generate code rapidly, but without reproducible, production-like environments, they cannot validate or refine cross-chain logic. AI requires the ability to spin up, test, and rerun end-to-end workflows — something current solutions cannot deliver.

Why PIDN unlocks this market:
- **Polkadot-first, multi-ecosystem**: Relay + parachains at the core, with Cosmos/Ethereum/Solana/Bitcoin optionally added.
- **One-command orchestration**: Launch complete testnets in minutes.
- **Production-like fidelity**: Runs real nodes and bridges, ensuring test results match live behavior.
- **Unified DX**: Single CLI/SDK across ecosystems, with CI templates, dashboards, and AI-assisted debugging.
- **AI-ready**: Containerized end-to-end framework that both humans and AI can use for iterative testing.

By collapsing setup from weeks to minutes and enabling AI-driven iteration, PIDN will transform Polkadot into the default hub for interoperability-native development. This positions Polkadot ahead of Cosmos, Ethereum, and Solana as the place where both human and AI developers build the next generation of cross-chain applications.

## Development Status

### Prior Work
- Built multi-chain testing frameworks (inspired by Starship-class infra) that orchestrated multiple blockchain environments, providing confidence in handling complex network topologies.
- Delivered proof-of-concept Polkadot local networks with CI integration, demonstrating reproducibility and automation on GitHub Actions.
- Authored scripts for Cosmos and EVM relayers, validating that cross-ecosystem flows can be automated in a CI/CD context.
- Conducted early Snowbridge experiments, confirming feasibility of DOT↔ETH test transfers in controlled environments.

### Research & Learnings
- **Zombienet Analysis**: Identified strengths for Substrate-only testing but confirmed the gap for true multi-ecosystem orchestration and production-like fidelity.
- **Reproducible CI**: Documented how devnets can be reliably spun up across Linux/macOS CI runners; noted friction points developers face when trying to debug across chains.
- **Benchmark Design**: Outlined plans for latency, finality, and throughput benchmarking, drawing inspiration from "Spammening"-style load tests to stress-test XCM and relayer performance.
- **DX Gaps**: Through user interviews and ecosystem conversations, observed that current workflows require developers to become DevOps experts first, validating the need for PIDN's "minutes not weeks" promise.

## Current Readiness
We have validated the core building blocks (spinning up Polkadot devnets in CI, automating relayers, running Snowbridge POCs).

Next stage is to integrate these into a unified CLI/API with production-like environments, expand to Cosmos/EVM/Solana modules, and deliver benchmarking + AI-assisted DX features.

## Development Roadmap with Milestones

**Total Duration**: 6–7 months  
**Team Effort (FTE)**: 2.5–3.0 full-time equivalents  
**Budget**: $90,000 USD  
**Payment Split**: 40% vested DOT (over 18 months), 60% USDC (AssetHub)

**Upfront Payment**: $20,000 USD (22.2% of total budget)
*Justification*: The upfront payment is essential to cover critical project initiation costs that cannot be deferred:
- **Developer Onboarding**: Transitioning our existing development team to focus full-time on PIDN requires immediate resource allocation to ensure dedicated commitment and rapid project kickoff.
- **Cloud Infrastructure & CI/CD Setup**: Production-like multi-chain devnets require substantial computational resources. We need to provision cloud instances for relay chains, parachains, and external blockchain nodes (Ethereum, Cosmos, Solana), plus establish robust CI/CD pipelines across multiple repositories.
- **Development Environment & Tooling**: Professional licenses for monitoring tools, development environments, security scanning tools, and premium organizational features necessary for enterprise-grade open-source development.

This upfront investment directly accelerates time-to-first-deliverable and ensures the team can focus on building rather than fundraising or infrastructure procurement during critical early development phases.

Baseline deliverables (license, documentation, testing, and Docker images) are included in every milestone; outreach deliverables are included in the final milestone.
