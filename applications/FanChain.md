## Project Overview :page_facing_up:
### Overview

FanChain is dedicated to empowering streamers, influencers, and their communities by providing a platform for NFT creation, trading, and community management. By leveraging the power of the Polkadot ecosystem, we aim to create a seamless and secure experience for content creators and their fans.


### Project Details

FanChain is a platform that enables streamers and influencers to create and issue NFT collections, including generative and membership NFTs. Fans can purchase these NFTs on our marketplace and participate in exclusive community events on Discord and Telegram. Additionally, FanChain offers a crypto-based donation system for viewers to support their favorite creators.
- **NFT Creation**: Streamers and influencers can create and issue NFT collections, including generative and membership NFTs.
- **Marketplace**: Users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs on our platform, fostering a vibrant and active community around content creators and their fans.
- **Community Management**: FanChain will offer tools for streamers and influencers to manage their Discord and Telegram communities, ensuring that only NFT holders can access exclusive channels and events. (Future plan)
- **Crypto Donations**: Viewers can support their favorite creators by donating cryptocurrency, with donation information displayed during live streams. (Future plan)
- **Compatibility**: FanChain will be compatible with all Wasm-supporting parachains, including prominent networks such as Astar Network, Phala Network, and more.

Technology Stack: FanChain will be compatible with EVM-supporting parachains, such as Astar Network, Moonbeam, and more, using a combination of NextJS and Node.js for the frontend and backend. The primary smart contract language will be Solidity. For NFT standards, we will use ERC721 and ERC1155 (Future plan), as they are the most widely used NFT standards and are well-supported by EVM-compatible parachains.

### Ecosystem Fit

The FanChain project will have a significant impact on the Polkadot ecosystem by demonstrating the capabilities and versatility of NFTs in the context of community management.
- **Increased adoption**: By providing a user-friendly platform for creators to issue NFTs and manage their communities, FanChain will attract more users to the Polkadot ecosystem. This increased adoption will raise awareness of Polkadot potential and versatility for various applications.
- **Innovation and exploration of new use cases**: The FanChain platform will encourage innovation in the NFT space. This could inspire other projects to leverage Polkadot for their applications, further expanding the ecosystem.
- **Collaboration and partnerships**: FanChain's potential partnerships with brands and businesses, and its integration with other social media platforms, will create more opportunities for collaboration within Polkadot ecosystem. This can lead to the development of new solutions and further expansion of the ecosystem.

Overall, the FanChain project will not only showcase the capabilities of NFTs but also promote their adoption, interoperability, and innovation within the Polkadot ecosystem.
