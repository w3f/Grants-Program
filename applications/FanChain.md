### Overview

FanChain is dedicated to empowering streamers, influencers, and their communities by providing a platform for NFT creation, trading, and community management. By leveraging the power of ink! smart contracts and the Polkadot ecosystem, we aim to create a seamless and secure experience for content creators and their fans.

- **NFT Creation**: Streamers and influencers can create and issue NFT collections, including generative and membership NFTs.
- **Marketplace**: Users can buy, sell, and trade NFTs on our platform, fostering a vibrant and active community around content creators and their fans.
- **Community Management**: FanChain will offer tools for streamers and influencers to manage their Discord and Telegram communities, ensuring that only NFT holders can access exclusive channels and events. (Future plan)
- **Crypto Donations**: Viewers can support their favorite creators by donating cryptocurrency, with donation information displayed during live streams. (Future plan)
- **Compatibility**: FanChain will be compatible with all Wasm-supporting parachains, including prominent networks such as Astar Network, Phala Network, and more.

Technology Stack: FanChain will be built using ink! for smart contracts for the underlying blockchain, and a combination of NextJS and Node.js for the frontend and backend.
