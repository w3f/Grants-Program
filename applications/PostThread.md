## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

If this application is in response to an RFP, please indicate this on the first line of this section.

If this is an application for a follow-up grant (the continuation of an earlier, successful W3F grant), please provide name and/or pull request of said grant on the first line of this section.

### Overview

PostThread is a web3 social media app that rewards it users instead of extracting from them. To do this we use blockchain economics that encourage users to post quality content and curate the platform.

For a full description of our project and our inspiration, please checkout our latest hackathon project page [here](https://devpost.com/software/postthread-gi7brt). In summary, we started this project because, just as many others are seeing, social media is in a crisis and we believe blockchain is the solution. Polkadot stood out to us due to it innovative parachain design and the fact a decentralized social network protocol (DSNP) was being built by the developers at [Project Liberty](https://www.projectliberty.io/). They have developed the [Frequency parachain](https://www.frequency.xyz/) and we plan to be the first social media dapp on it.  

### Project Details

## The Frontpage of the Blockchain
![frontpage](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1cJ1ReF_t0EwGZq8ZA40tBfVg9m1cXr_F)

That is a screen shot of our frontpage, but you can see the real thing at [PostThread.app](https://postthread.app/), so please go check it out.

Our website works just like any other with all data and interactions being stored in a database. Using GraphQL, the database is access by a nightly script that mints user assets to the blockchain. The frontend and backend communicate through this database. For example, the backend script calculates how much each user receives daily form their airdrop and updates the value in the database accordingly. When a user claims it a boolean flag is changed which alerts the backend. We had previously used a REST API to handle all this logic, but found it unnecessarily complex and harder to communicate through. 

Interaction with the blockchain are handled using the Substrate Python package. The frequency parachain we are building on was developed using RUST.

The frontend was built using NextJS and Tailwinds for styling.

### Ecosystem Fit

We will be the first social media platform to build on the Frequency parachain, which just recently won their parachain auction. Future social media platforms will be able to benefit from whatever ecosystem we are able to develop there.

We are hiding all the crypto aspects of our project from the user in an attempt to attract non-crypto users to the platform and therefore Polkadot as a whole. We think social media could be a huge gateway to getting average users into crypto due to the current events we are all seeing go on at other major social media companies.

Please describe the team's relevant experience. If your project involves development work, we would appreciate it if you singled out a few interesting projects or contributions made by team members in the past. For research-related grants, references to past publications and projects in a related domain are helpful.

If anyone on your team has applied for a grant at the Web3 Foundation previously, please list the name of the project and legal entity here.

My partner and I have been developing web3 apps together since May 2022. We began with PostThread, but have also built a great NFT-to-NFT trading market, [BazaarMarket](https://bazaarmarket.xyz/) with a Pokemon inspired AI generated trading card NFT collection, [Diffemon](https://bazaarmarket.xyz/collection/diffemon) to go along with it. We also created [Unstable Labs](https://www.unstablelabs.app/), an AI text-to-image generator on NEAR protocol. As you can see we have a big imagination and a strong desire to build in web3.

Before our evolution into web3, Ian was a data scientist for 6 years and Paolo was a DevOps engineer. Ian's strong Python skills helped to deploy all of our projects smart contract functionality by taking advantage of the web3 and substrate python libraries. Paolo refined his UI/UX skilled through our hackathons and has become an expert in NextJS. You can view his webpage [here](https://pulesdev.vercel.app/).

## Development Status :open_book:

We began our project in May 2022 during the 2 week EthGlobal HackMoney hackathon. There my partner and I met and began brainstorming and created a rough concept of PostThread. We won "Best Use" of Worldcoin by rewarding users for verifying their humanity with their WorldCoin ID. We have stayed in contact with  them ever since and plan to help them bring WorldCoin to Polkadot and then implement it in our dapp. You can view that project page [here](https://ethglobal.com/showcase/postthread-o665n)

Next, we joined the Polkadot Hackathon: North America Edition and started our idea from scratch. We found Project Liberty and decided to build on their protocol. Since they were still in development at that time, we deployed with a locally hosted version of their parachain. PostThread won first place in our category as well as "The Best use of Crust". You can view that project page [here](https://devpost.com/software/postthread-uhgac6)

Lastly, we wanted to continue our work on PostThread, so we implement the Frequency parachain as a smart contract and retrofitted the backend to call it using the web3 library. This implementation had the biggest improvement in the UI as well. You can view that project page [here](https://devpost.com/software/postthread-gi7brt)

Since then, Robin Ejsmond-Frey has reached out to us to help us apply for this grant. We are thankful for his help and excited for the next steps for PostThread.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

## Future Plans

Our long term plans are to grow to be the largest decentralized social media platform and onboard the most users to crypto any dapp has ever done. We think we are primed for that due to the current social media climate and our first-of-its-kind technology that abstracts the crypto aspects away from the user.
