***TetraPay***

***Project Introduction***

TetraPay designed Tetra currency to act as an algorithmic stable currency. We retain its highly decentralized characteristics, and we guarantee the Tetra currency has a relatively stable price through algorithms and protocols. We hope TetraPay can become a widely used means of payment. To achieve this goal, a relatively stable value is not enough. The system will also provide a higher incentive ratio for users who save regularly, obtaining a return on investment significantly higher than any commercial bank’s interest rate. We believe that the performance of TetraPay will gradually attract users and expand its scope of use.

***VALUE-EXCHANGE RATE ORACLE***

Our core goal is to enable TetraPay currency to maintain its purchasing power, have a long-term stable value, and gradually develop into a medium for large-scale transactions and savings. Therefore, TetraPay currency first needs to have a clear value, and keep its price fluctuating within a narrow range around the value.

First the exchange rate of a legal tender cannot be read directly on the blockchain. 

Secondly, TetraPay currency has a time-sensitive price in the secondary market and is also exogenous to the blockchain, so the agreement must rely on a decentralized method and technology to estimate the real exchange rate.

***EXCHANGE RATE PREDICTION MACHINE***

\- Regarding TetraPay currency price, the miners initiate a vote, and the voting content is the exchange rate to a legal tender.

\- After a certain number of blocks, we count votes and take the median as the current exchange rate of the real TetraPay currency.

\- According to the final voting exchange rate, a range of exchange rates centered on the final exchange rate is delineated. A certain amount of incentives will be used to reward miners who vote within this range. Miners who vote outside this range will be punished.

\- The system adjusts the scope of rewards and punishments every time to ensure that enough miners participate in voting.

This voting mechanism ensures that the exchange rate will remain fluctuating within a narrow range, because those who maintain stability will be rewarded, and those who are dishonest will be punished. But we still need to consider the attacking behavior of the saboteur on the mechanism.

***LONG-TERM STABLE DEVELOPMENT-INCENTIVE MECHANISM***

Miners in TetraPay currency Play a vital role in the system. On one hand, the miners participated and maintained the PoS consensus, therefore the TetraPay currency system provides a security guarantee. On the other hand, the miners have absorbed TetraPay currency fluctuations in a short period thereby bearing the cost of shrinking the money supply and realized a stable TetraPay currency System.

***Stablecoin Algorithm (4 months)***

Phase 1 - Exchange rate prediction machine (1 month)

For the blockchain, the exchange rate of legal tender and the effective price of TetraPay currency in the secondary market are exogenous. The agreement relies on a decentralized exchange rate oracle to estimate the real exchange rate. Specific needs to achieve the following functions:

Voting: The voting content is the exchange rate of TetraPay currency to legal tender.

Exchange rate calculation: after a certain number of blocks, count votes to determine the current exchange rate of TetraPay currency.

Reward and punishment mechanism: Incentive or punish participating miners based on voting content and final results.

 

Phase 2 - Achieve a single currency stablecoin project (2 months)

TetraPay keeps the currency value stable through market behavior adjustment. Regardless of whether the exchange rate of TetraPay currency rises or falls, the system follows the target exchange rate, allowing users to exchange payara worth 1 legal currency and 1 TetraPay currency. At this stage, the exchange function between TetraPay and payara needs to be achieved.

In the second phase, the TetraPay project will be implemented to achieve a single currency stablecoin project, and it can be put into use initially.

 

Phase 3 - Multi-currency stablecoin project (1 month)

The goal of the TetraPay currency system is to become a widely used transaction medium and payment method. In the third phase, a multi-currency stable currency project will be realized.

On the one hand, we need to implement the exchange function between multi-currency TetraPay and payara on the basis of the second phase.

On the other hand, we also need the previous two stages as the basis to realize the construction of exchange rate prediction machines for different currencies and realize the exchange function between different TetraPay currencies.
