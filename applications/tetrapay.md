## Project Overview ðŸ“„

### Overview

TetraPay is a cross currency lossless payment and settlement system. We hope TetraPay can become a widely used means of payment. To achieve this goal, a relatively stable value is not enough. TetraPay will also provide a higher incentive ratio for users who save regularly, obtaining a return on investment significantly higher than any commercial bankâ€™s interest rate.We believe that the performance of TetraPay will gradually attract users and expand its scope of use.
This application is to realize the oracle and algorithm part of stable currency Tetra.

### Project Details

TetraPay designed Tetra currency to act as an algorithmic stable currency. We retain its highly decentralized characteristics, and we guarantee the Tetra currency has a relatively stable price through algorithms and protocols.



##### ***MORE THAN JUST A WALLET***

1:1 anchored digital stable currencies issued relying on banks, settlement agencies, and commercial institutions in each country; ensuring value anchoring through strict mathematical models, and relying on financial services such as savings, wealth management, lending, staking and other financial services to ensure user profitability while removing hidden costs in currency circulation. Our goal is to achieve a free flow of various anchored currencies.

Manage, exchange and invest your assets with our multichain portfolio. TetraPay will offer users with a safe and practical solution for a new era in mobile payment and financial possibilities.

***Fast Real-Time Confirmation:*** Using Polkadot's cross-chain protocol, assets can be directly pledged or liquidated into local fiat currency, quickly settled, and confirmed in milliseconds.

***Deep Learning Mode:*** Original Rui's algorithm is based on the combination of machine learning, artificial intelligence and offline economic models, so that the exchange rate have minimal fluctuations and is more convenient for offline payments.

***Agency Payment Mechanism:*** Merchants bear the gas cost when users pay,so that the user can pay without loss, and the merchant will receive a subsidy to offset the gas costs.

##### ***VALUE-EXCHANGE RATE ORACLE***

Our core goal is to enable TetraPay currency to maintain its purchasing power, have a long-term stable value, and gradually develop into a medium for large-scale transactions and savings. Therefore, TetraPay currency first needs to have a clear value, and keep its price fluctuating within a narrow range around the value.

First the exchange rate of a legal tender cannot be read directly on the blockchain. Secondly, TetraPay currency has a time-sensitive price in the secondary market and is also exogenous to the blockchain, so the agreement must rely on a decentralized method and technology to estimate the real exchange rate.

##### ***EXCHANGE RATE PREDICTION MACHINE***

\- Regarding TetraPay currency price, the miners initiate a vote, and the voting content is the exchange rate to a legal tender.

\- After a certain number of blocks, we count votes and take the median as the current exchange rate of the real TetraPay currency.

\- According to the final voting exchange rate, a range of exchange rates centered on the final exchange rate is delineated. A certain amount of incentives will be used to reward miners who vote within this range. Miners who vote outside this range will be punished.

\- The system adjusts the scope of rewards and punishments every time to ensure that enough miners participate in voting.

This voting mechanism ensures that the exchange rate will remain fluctuating within a narrow range, because those who maintain stability will be rewarded, and those who are dishonest will be punished. But we still need to consider the attacking behavior of the saboteur on the mechanism.

##### ***LONG-TERM STABLE DEVELOPMENT-INCENTIVE MECHANISM***

Miners in TetraPay currency Play a vital role in the system. On one hand, the miners participated and maintained the PoS consensus, therefore the TetraPay currency system provides a security guarantee. On the other hand, the miners have absorbed TetraPay currency fluctuations in a short period thereby bearing the cost of shrinking the money supply and realized a stable TetraPay currency System.

##### ***AUXILIARY CURRENCY PAYARA***

TetraPay currency is a decentralized digital currency, when the system detects any deviation of the exchange rate of the legal tender, it is necessary to put pressure on prices through algorithms and agreements to normalize prices. Like any other market, TetraPay currency has the market following simple rules of supply and demand, shrinking the supply of currency will result in higher relative currency prices. That is, when the exchange rate level is lower than the target level, a sufficient reduction in the money supply will restore the price level to normal.

In the same method, expanding the money supply will result in a lower relative currency price. That is, when the exchange rate level is higher than the target level, a sufficient increase in the money supply will restore the price level to normal.

The specific implementation of the above method is through our system protocol, algorithm, and auxiliary currency PAYARA. TetraPay currency Issuance on the POS consensus type blockchain, miners need to mortgage payara in it to proceed TetraPay currency mining. Similar to other POS consensus, the number of payara owned determines the mining rights of miners. In each block cycle, the agreement will select a block producer from the secured miners, who are responsible for summarizing transactions, reaching a consensus among miners, and ensuring that messages are correctly distributed in a short time to produce the next block.

How do we use payara to make the exchange rate of TetraPay currency remains stable, which is  an important part of the agreement? Simply put, to achieve the above requirements, we allow anyone to exchange between payara and TetraPay currencies at the target exchange rate.

Specifically, from a long-term perspective, the total amount of payara is unchanged, it has a stable demand, so although miners have absorbed the contraction cost of TetraPay currency, its  long-term benefits can be guaranteed. Further, the Protocol and algorithm miners will also be incentivized to ensure that miners who maintain the stability of the currency system will be rewarded.

## ***Future Plans***

1. Our payment App TetraPay will initially be promoted in Brazil and South Korea
2. We need to build a Polkadot parachain, complete our stablecoin agreement, and implement the exchange between any digital currency and tetra stablecoin through the Polkadot cross-chain protocol.
3. Through Defi, Staking and other methods, users can deposit coins and earn interest, and borrow money for financial management to improve the retention of assets on the chain.
4. In the later stage, a private trading market will be created through private computing.



## Additional Information âž•

1. The first version of our payment app has been developed, and we are discussing promotion with local churches and chambers of commerce in Sao Paulo, Brazil.
2. We reached a user promotion cooperation with Dukascopy Bank.
