### Ecosystem Fit
This project directly contributes to the Polkadot ecosystem by:

1. **Substrate Chain Integration**: We will build a custom Substrate parachain for cleaning service verification and payment processing, ensuring immutable service records and automated smart contract execution.

2. **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: Implementing Polkadot's DID standard for employee and client identity management, enabling self-sovereign identity for all stakeholders.

3. **Cross-Chain Asset Management**: Using Polkadot's XCM (Cross-Consensus Message Format) for cross-chain payment processing and asset transfers between different cleaning service providers and clients.

4. **Polkadot Native Tokens**: Implementing DOT-based payment systems and reward mechanisms for service quality and performance.

5. **Parachain for Service Verification**: Creating a specialized parachain that handles:
   - Service completion verification through IoT devices and mobile check-ins
   - Quality assessment using AI/ML models with on-chain validation
   - Automated payment processing using smart contracts
   - Supply chain tracking for cleaning supplies and equipment

6. **Polkadot.js Integration**: Full integration with Polkadot.js for wallet connectivity and transaction management.
