Project Overview :page\_facing\_up:
-----------------------------------

### Overview

**Tagline:** A streamlined developer tool for Solidity smart contract deployment and testing on Polkadot.

**Brief Description:**  
Bison is a developer tool designed to onboard Solidity developers into the Polkadot ecosystem by adapting the **Foundry** suite. The primary focus will be on:

*   **Forge**: A testing framework customized to support Solidity smart contracts on Polkadot, compiling to **WASM** and **PolkaVM** via **Solang** and **Revive** compilers.
*   **Mint**: A new tool using **subxt** to replace Cast, providing an interface for interacting with smart contracts, sending transactions, and querying chain data.

The tool will allow Solidity developers to continue using familiar workflows for building and testing smart contracts, while also handling deployment to Polkadot chains via **pallet-contracts**. Future iterations will expand towards deeper JAM protocol support, but this scope will focus on Polkadot integration.

**Relation to Substrate/Polkadot/Kusama**:  
Bison leverages Polkadot’s Substrate framework for smart contract deployment via **pallet-contracts**. It integrates **subxt** for transaction handling and contract interaction, enabling developers to transition from Ethereum-based tooling to Polkadot seamlessly.

**Why We Are Interested**:  
As one of the teams working on the development of the JAM protocol, our team saw a need for smart contract tooling for PolkaVM targets. 
Although the existing tooling, foundry can be used as-is for EVM compatible parachains that support the RPC endpoints, this is not the case
for future smart contract development that target PolkaVM. Our team is passionate about building tools that ease the transition for Solidity developers to explore Polkadot’s multi-chain ecosystem. By leveraging Foundry and customizing it for Polkadot, we aim to make this process as smooth and familiar as possible for developers.

Project Details
---------------

### Technology Stack:

*   **[Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry)**: Core testing framework for Solidity (customized for building and deploying on Polkadot).
*   **[Solang](https://github.com/hyperledger-solang/solang)**: Solidity to WASM compiler.
*   **[Revive](https://github.com/paritytech/revive/)**: Solidity to PolkaVM compiler.
*   **[subxt](https://github.com/paritytech/subxt)**: Substrate interaction library for **Mint** (replacing Cast).
*   **Rust**: For subxt and Polkadot-specific tooling development.

### Deliverables:

1.  **Customized Foundry Toolchain**:
    *   Integrates Solang and Revive compilers for WASM and PolkaVM.
    *   Deploy contracts using subxt via Polkadot's **pallet-contracts**.
2.  **Mint Tool**:
    *   Replaces Cast with a subxt-powered tool for interacting with smart contracts.
3.  **Documentation Website**:
    *   A website offering detailed documentation, examples, and guides for Solidity developers on Polkadot.

### What the project is _not_:

*   The project does not include JAM protocol integration at this stage.
*   It will not include Anvil or Chisel customization in this phase.

### Ecosystem Fit:

**Target Audience**:  
Solidity developers, dApp developers, smart contract auditors, and Polkadot parachain developers looking for a Solidity-native toolchain for Polkadot.

**Needs Addressed**:  
Bison will address the need for Ethereum developers to interact with Polkadot using familiar tools, facilitating easy migration and development on Polkadot chains.

**Similar Projects**:  
While other projects focus on native smart contract development for Polkadot (like ink!), Bison focuses on **Solidity** developers and provides familiar tooling to interact with the Polkadot ecosystem.

Additional Information :heavy\_plus\_sign:
------------------------------------------

We learned about the Web3 Foundation Grants Program through Polkadot developer community discussions and are eager to contribute by building tools that simplify Solidity development for Polkadot chains.
