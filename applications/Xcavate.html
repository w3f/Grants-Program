According to the UN, the global population is set to reach over 11.2 billion by the year 2100, therefore 2 billion new homes are required in the next 80 years. 20% of all housing is built by small to medium sized real estate developers but access to finance through traditional banks and other financial institutions is complex, time consuming and expensive.</p><p>Xcavate is looking to solve this issue by developing a completely decentralised lending and NFT protocol governed by a DAO to help fund the building of real world real estate assets, as well as transact and manage fractions of each property as a route to a global real estate investor market. Our goal is to create a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation (DAO), which has a core Fellowship of real estate developers, investors and blockchain developers accountable to its wider community, so more houses can be built and invested in to help reach the growing demand.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a href="#overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Overview" title="Direct link to Overview">​</a></h3><p>Xcavate will be a first-of-its-kind real-world land &amp; property NFT platform that collateralises real world parcels of land to finance real estate development.
Xcavate facilitates digitising land and/or property title deeds through minting and bundling of NFTs, which are then linked to verifiable digital identities (DIDs) approved by government entities.
Xcavate is an ecosystem that allows real-world property developers access to finance parcels of physical land with planning permission for development. Once the land is at the final development stage, the developer will create NFTs for the individual properties to be sold/managed by a peer-to-peer marketplace (property owners, investors, trusts etc.).
The system will significantly reduce the time from real estate planning permission to build start. By simplifying the finance application process and speeding up the release of funds to the developer. Xcavate not only provides real-world property developers with a way to build quicker but, as a result, enables a more significant number of much-needed houses to be delivered to market. It also provides liquidity to static real-world assets at every stage of the property development process in a fair and risk-averse way. It will enable the real estate to be onboarded cleanly and efficiently, opening up opportunities throughout the broader Dotsama ecosystem.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>We will initially build a POC of the real estate developer loan process to prove the concept. Building a simple polkadot.js wallet that allows verification of identity and creation of DIDS (through the KILT protocol). Once land ownership and build value has been identified (using Oracles) then the LAND NFT can be minted and placed in a multi-sig wallet along with the full loan amount (from the community loan pool). Each build tranche of money will be delivered to the real estate developer wallet, once real estate build evidence has been established and verified.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://xcavate.io/W3F/DeveloperLoanProcessPOCv2.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Xcavate will adapt and build multiple Pallets to execute the functionalities. We will use the KILT SDK as well as the substrate framework and primary language Rust to create the pallets on the Polkadot ecosystem.
Token Pallet
Decentralised Identity Document pallet
User Management pallet
Loan Management pallet
Transaction management pallet
Staking pallet
Verification pallet</p><p>This Architecture diagram shows the visual representation that maps out the physical implementation for components in the Polkadot ecosystem and how the scalability of the platform works. The diagram represents Microservices we are using to execute the functionality. API gateway will split the API calls to the respective microservices. We are using an s3 bucket to store the media files. We are using pallets to execute the functions on the Polkadot ecosystem.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://xcavate.io/W3F/XCAV-WEB-3-Grant-Application-Image-4.jpg" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Token:
XCAV - Platforms Native Token to launch a para chain and participate in a crowd loan/slot auction. XCAV tokens are used to stake within the platform. We will create these tokens with the Transfer, Mint, Burn, Approve, and Allowance functions.
Liquidity Pool:
Xcavate creates a liquidity pool to store staked tokens, staked tokens will be queued and utilized for each loan application. XCAV tokens are swapped as GBPT through XCM and deposited on the Central Loan pool.
Central Loan Pool:
Xcavate Creates a central loan pool to manage Loan amounts and Loan repayment. The central lending pool will act as the heart of the platform to map all the transactions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technology-stack">Technology Stack<a href="#technology-stack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technology Stack" title="Direct link to Technology Stack">​</a></h3><ul><li>React.js</li><li>Node.js</li><li>Express.js</li><li>Rust</li><li>Substrate Framework</li><li>Polkadot</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="third-party">Third-Party<a href="#third-party" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Third-Party" title="Direct link to Third-Party">​</a></h3><ul><li>Kilt – SDK</li><li>Chainlink</li><li>AWS</li></ul><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h3><p>After many months of research, we initially met on a zoom with Ingo from Kilt, discussing our idea and talking through how the Kilt chain can be incorporated into the Xcavate system. A few weeks later, we contacted Acala and met with Robinson, who was very helpful and enthusiastic about us being involved in the ecosystem and our potential partnership. We also reached Centrifuge and spent many weeks looking through their docs with the initial idea of creating a dApp on their chain, but as there were some striking differences in how their chain operated, it was apparent that was not going to be the best fit for our project. Going forward, however, once the real estate has been built, there will be opportunities for us to introduce Centrifuge.</p><p>We feel this is a great way to bring land &amp; Property assets into the digital ecosystem to interact with the following potential partners:</p><p><strong>Kilt (Identity &amp; wallet)</strong>
This is a crucial part of the initial process to verify; Real Estate Director, Company &amp; Title Deed and create DID’s, which will be held in a polkadot.js wallet and used throughout the process.
<strong>Statemint / Acala</strong>
There are many stages of financing that will involve aUSD / USDT / GDPT… from the initial funding pool, a liquidity pool, as well as the need to exchange the locked loan value for each project in GBP stable coins (as our initial market is based in the UK).
<strong>CRUST</strong>
Our POC will use AWS to prove the concept, however going forward we will look to host our dApp and all the land and property related documents on the Crust network.
<strong>Subwallet</strong>

This has been coupled with the idea of bringing land and property from its current state into the web3 ecosystem. We have been meeting with top-level industry leads, government officials and developers.
Robin Ejsmond-Frey and Nico Morgan from Parity have been a tremendous help by supporting us with information about the W3F grant application process and recommendations to attend Hackathons and the Polkadot Decoded Event London. As well as as number of forums to help our substrate development knowledge.</p><p>We have been taking time to play with Substrate to form initial local nodes.

We will adapt FRAME pallets to create a unique structure of a central community loan pool that acts as a risk reducer to allow individual loan stakers to lock and unlock native XCAV coins quickly and easily, rather than being committed to the full term of a particular loan. This will provide an attractive low risk investment opportunity and increase community confidence in the network while eliminating any delay in providing the funds to the real estate development project, once all the necessary checks have been completed. This loan pool structure could be applied to many different chains in future projects.
