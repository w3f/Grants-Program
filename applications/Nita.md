## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

#### Liquidity Trilemma
![solution](https://drive.google.com/uc?id=1wlS4UK7_ZQlEgG2xsnj5_On3EjLlks_m)

Orderbook based decentralized exchanges (e.g., 0x) suffer from lack of liquidity issues. 

As a result, automated market makers (e.g., Uniswap) gain popularity recently with constant product pricing function.
However, such solutions rely on mechanical and static pricing functions, facing the following three issues:

* **Price Slippage:** The static pricing is not adaptive to market dynamics. This leads to arbitrage opportunities.
* **Divergent Loss:** When market price fluctuates, arbitrageurs exploit the pricing inefficiencies with liquidity provider token loss.
* **Capital Efficiency:** Tokens are deposited to liquidity pool for pricing purposes only. Capital efficiency is low as a result.

#### ML Enabled Solution

The root cause lies in the mechanical nature of the pricing functions. Therefore, we propose to use machine learning for adpative and dynamic price learning.
The onchain pricing leverages machine learning and can therefore navigates liquidity trilemma dynamically given different market situations

### Project Details

We use machine learning to build a bilateral market maker. In particular, onchain online learning algorithms are used for the market making algorithm learning.
Liquidity providers profit from bilaternal trading directions.

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  * Efficient ML based DeFi platform
* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  * Token traders and liquidity providers
* What need(s) does your project meet?
  * Optimal trader experience and yield farming rate optimization for liquidity providers
* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  * No
