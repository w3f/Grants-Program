A dashboard panel for admins to gather useful business data of their subscribed users(by protecting users&#x27; privacy) and a dashboard panel for users to manage all their subscriptions in one place.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="overview">Overview<a class="hash-link" href="#overview" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><p><strong>SubsCrypt</strong> focuses on solving a traditional problem on both the user and the developer side. Developers will no more be worried about the privacy of and maintaining the customers&#x27; database and payment mechanism. Using <strong>SubsCrypt</strong>, they can integrate Web3 in their service to benefit from blockchain in a developer-friendly way(minimum time and expertise resource). Users will also enjoy the privacy that they can preserve and the all-in-one platform to manage their subscriptions in different services. By making all these procedures easy, we can help small online businesses to enjoy the benefits of <strong>Web3</strong> and to only focus on their service, which will hopefully lead to mass-adoption of <strong>Web3</strong></p><p>We have been developing on different web3 technologies, but none could satisfy our customization requirements. By using Substrate, we can customize our parachain so it can fit our needs(we are also willing to continue our project to be a PolkaDot parachain)</p><p>Assume a scenario that Alice is a user of a service that provides monthly subscription for milk delivery(called Milkryption). Milkryption has a monthly and yearly subscryption method and they use <strong>SubsCrypt</strong> on their website (first they submit their method on our contract in our website, then they can use our API), so if Alice ever has used our service so far, she will only need to connect his wallet and subscript to the Milkryption using a trigger contract method(she will send some encrypted data that is encrypted with her key and also service provider key and then she will share that key with the service provider to have access to her data in the contract) but if that&#x27;s her first time to ever use <strong>SubsCrypt</strong>, she has to also sign-up in the contract. Alice now can anytime request for a refund of remaining days of her service directly from the contract. Alice will hopefully use our service in several websites and now she can go to our website and manage his subscriptions(refunding or renewing) in one place. </p><p>In our country, we have a lot of restrictions and censorship. We are suffering from Iran&#x27;s government&#x27;s Strict policies and getting banned from universal communities and worldwide payment (e.g., PayPal and visa card) all because we are Iranian.
Two months ago, our team started this idea to resolve these limits and connect our people worldwide. We will now announce our project as a service on blockchain to spread this type of freedom to the world.
Besides, this, we have experience in developing different backend services and Dapps, and we came to the conclusion that our platform can help developers to migrate from web2 to web3 and also help users by enhancing their user experience to use web3 websites(they only need to use a wallet for registration, and our login procedure can be handled without wallet)</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a class="hash-link" href="#project-details" title="Direct link to heading">​</a></h3><ul><li><p>Mockups/designs of any UI components
One of the most important aspects of our service is UI/UX, and we are all aware of the difficulties of web3 usage for the majority of people, so we will provide a UI component that can be integrated into the websites and also a webpage that has an invoice to pay( developers can choose whichever method that suits them better). We are also planning to design a user/developer dashboard that will retrieve necessary data from the blockchain</p></li><li><p>An overview of the technology stack to be used<br>

For the first milestone, we will implement our smart contract can be deployed to a substrate chain using ink! Which is a smart contract substrate pallet. The second and third milestones will be implemented in parallel. The last milestone will be connecting the components to work seamlessly together.</p><p><strong>There will be three ways to connect to our smart contract:</strong></p><ol><li>Using a Polkadot{.js} wallet to interact with the contract(state of the contract can be modified in this scenario)</li><li>Using our RestAPI backend or third party library to retrieve data from the contract (state of the contract can not be modified in this scenario)</li><li>Using any customized client to interact with the contract</li></ol><p><strong>Auth mechanism :</strong>
We have designed a secure and user-friendly auth mechanism that users and providers can easily use it.</p><p>Users have to choose a pair of token and passphrase, which we recommend having a common token(more than 16 chars) in every provider that they subscribe but have a different passphrase(can be small). Users will submit sha256(token+passphrase) to the contract, and whenever they want to authenticate themselves, they have to provide these token and passphrase in a view function( which is not a transaction, so it&#x27;s not on-chain and free).
They also have to once set their sha256(token+passphrase) for using the SubsCrypt dashboard without a wallet.
The authentication with a wallet is checked by the blockchain address sender.</p><p><strong>First milestone</strong>: we will design(it is almost done right now) and implement our smart contract, and we will also design XD files of UI, and we will write our white-paper in this milestone(including the test unit).</p><p>The main functions that will be deployed on the chain in this milestone are as follow:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Function</th><th>Description</th><th>Params</th><th>Returns</th><th>State mutability</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>addPlan</td><td>This function is for providers to add their plans; each plan has duration, price, max refund percent that they are willing to lock in contract and withdraw after that the subscription period has finished.</td><td>list of durations, list of prices, list of max refund percent</td><td>None</td><td>change state</td></tr><tr><td>editPlan</td><td>This function is for providers to edit their plan.
