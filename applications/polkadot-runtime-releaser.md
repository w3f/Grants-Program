## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Polkadot Runtime Releaser aka PRR.

Since last year, my work is mainly focused on the chain/node maintenance.
Runtime upgrade is a great feature for the Polkadot-SDK.
But there are lots of potential issues that could happen during the runtime upgrade.
Especially to the new teams, they might not have enough experience to handle it.

- How to setup a try-runtime CI?
- How to setup the release CI?
  - The log affects the runtime file size.
  - The rustc/OS version affects the compiled artifacts.
  - There are also some unclear things of the srtool.
    - E.G. https://substrate.stackexchange.com/questions/11686/getting-error-rust-nightly-not-installed-when-starting-an-srtool-container-to-buâ€‹a
- When to notify the community to upgrade the node?
  - Collator/Validator nodes should be upgraded first.
  - RPC suppliers should be upgraded later.
    - I saw some EVM RPCs require the runtime version to be equal to the node version.
- How to host a wasm-override repository for the community?
  - Debug log WASM.
    - We always use `sp-api/disable-logging` in the release build, so no more detail logs in the general runtime.
    - We can enable the `sp-debug-derive/force-debug` in the debug build, so we can get more logs instead of `WASM stripped` (I think people often see this a lot while they are trying to get some debug log).
  - EVM tracing WASM.
    - For some EVM chains, they need to trace the EVM execution.

PRR's goal is to streamline the process of releasing a new runtime for the Polkadot-SDK-based chain. It provides a standard way to release a new runtime, including the CI setup, runtime upgrade notification, and wasm-override repository hosting.

### Ecosystem Fit

For any Polkadot-SDK-based chain, they could use PRR to release their runtime. It's a tool that could help them to release the runtime in a more standard way.

### Details(spec)

For PRR's utilization, the chain team requires two repositories: one for their code and another for the release.

Take `foo-network` as an example.
They should have two repositories, `foo-network/foo` and `foo-network/foo-release`.

`foo-network/foo` is the base Polkadot-SDK-based chain repository that everyone should have.

`foo-network/foo-release` is a new repository that PRR requires.
It will have 2 branches, `foo` and `bar` if they have 2 networks, `foo`(mainnet) and `bar`(canary network).
It will host the override WASMs and the release under the corresponding network branch.

For collator/validator nodes, they should monitor the `foo-network/foo` repository release as usual.
For RPC suppliers or service node, they should monitor the `foo-network/foo-release` repository release, it's a more stable version. It will only be published once the on-chain runtime upgrade get confirmed.

PRR will supply these components, which will all be hosted in one repository.
- A GitHub Action to response the try-runtime. (Users can comment something like `/bot try-runtime <network>` under a release PR to trigger this action.)
- A GitHub Action to build the release runtime.
- A GitHub Action to notify release repository there is a new release that release repository can start preparing the override WASMs.
- A GitHub Action and a tool to monitor the on-chain runtime version and compare it with the release runtime version to trigger the release on the release repository.
- A tool to build and manage the override WASMs.

|   GitHub Action | Trigger                                                  | Output                                                                                                                  |
| --------------: | -------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|     try-runtime | Comment `/bot try-runtime <network>` under the PR.       | Bot will comment the try-runtime result under the PR.                                                                   |
| Runtime release | Usually by tag, this can be configured by users.         | Build and release the runtime files.                                                                                    |
|   WASM override | Runtime release action will notify this action.          | Build and push the runtime files to the repository.                                                                     |
|    Node release | It's a scheduled action that runs every hour by default. | Retrieve the on-chain runtime version and compare it with the latest GitHub tag to determine if a release is necessary. |

Each component will have a very detailed guide to help the chain team to set up.

## Future Plans

- Keep connected with the community/parity and make it better.

## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

Since every component is connected closely, I prefer to finish them all in one milestone for easy auditing and testing.
