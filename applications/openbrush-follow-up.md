# W3F Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** [OpenBrush](https://github.com/Supercolony-net/openbrush-contracts)
* **Team Name:** [SuperColony](https://github.com/Supercolony-net)
* **Payment Address:** ERC 20 ADDRESS: 0xE1B19cE32866cDE87F8f59C7C2C5f90E093A6942
* **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2, It is follow-up grant for [first grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/497).


## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

It is an application for a follow-up grant. The [initial grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/497) covered the first and second milestones:
 - [Openbrush Milestone 1 delivery report](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/249)
 - [Openbrush Milestone 2 delivery report](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pull/261)

This grant aims to cover milestones 3-5.

### Overview
The mission of this project is to make ink! usable and facilitate WASM ecosystem adoption. 

To be successful with this mission, we have outlined several steps that would need to be taken.
1. OpenBrush is a library for secure smart contract development on ink!, same as
   [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts) on Ethereum.
2. OpenBrush should serve as a starting point for every developer entering a Polkadot(ink!) ecosystem.
3. In addition to having a standard implementation, Openbrush should also have macroses to simplify and abstract up applications(smart contracts) development.
4. For Openbrush to fulfill its purpose, several changes must be made & several blockers to be overcome in `ink!` and in Substrate's `pallet-contracts`. We are committed to doing that in the context of this project.

This project is important to us as it's our strategic goal to accelerate Polkadot ecosystem development. Applications on Ink! are a considerable part of it.

### Project Details
OpenBrush should serve as a starting point for every smart contract developer coming from Ethereum. The extended documentation will cover several topics:
the differences between ink! and Solidity, how developers should change their mindset, how to design their project,
how to deploy contracts and test them, etc.

The library will provide the default implementation of standard contracts, which
can be customized by developers. Also, the library will provide additional
features useful for development that are not available in ink! yet(the plan is to integrate them to ink! itself at a later point within Openbrush scope),
but which can be useful for development.

Our team aims to improve the smart-contract development experience,
and wants to improve ink!, make it more user-friendly and to popularize it.

### Ecosystem Fit

* Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

The necessity of a solution like this seemed rather urgent to us when we started to work with ink!. We quickly realized that we strategically would like to become the company that builds in the ecosystem. We decided that we wanted to commit and help ink! become widely used. Right now usability of ink! can be easily improved. OpenBrush is dedicated to change that.

* Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

Our target audience is smart contract developers on ink!.

* What need(s) does your project meet?

Our project is the starting point for smart contract developers coming from other ecosystems like Ethereum, and it aims to improve smart contract development on ink!.

* Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?

We are only aware about one project [metis](https://github.com/patractlabs/metis). We partnered with them to collaborate on the ecosystem as we have the same common goal.

* If so, how is your project different?

Our project isn't restricted to only providing the base implementation of contracts.
Objectively speaking, based on what we know and what was listed in their proposal, here are key differences:
- At the moment, OpenBrush is in far more advanced stage, Developer Experience of our library is significantly higher.
- OpenBrush aims to propose and take care of standards for ink! (We've already created [PSP](https://github.com/w3f/PSPs/pull/25) for fungible tokens, and we plan to continue doing so)
- OpenBrush aims to be a starting point for any smart contract developer by providing documentation.
- Contribute to ink! and Substrate `contract-pallet` to improve the smart-contract development experience(add new features, fix bugs, etc.).

"In 2019 I started to get involved in the IT area. At first, I tried myself as a developer, and eventually I went away from that, to design. At first, I tried myself in design, then when I saw the result, and understood that I liked it, so I found courses and got a diploma. Then I tried freelancing, like many other beginners, but came to the conclusion that the working for a company is much better, and that is where a person can get a tremendous amount of experience, while constantly evolving, because you have to keep up with the tasks, and most importantly to understand them and try to implement them correctly. At the same time, it is my third year studying in Karazin, specialty marketing."

| 1.     | Remove boilerplate code                             | We will provide a macro which will allow to remove boilerplate during usage of library(Library provides implementation on rust level in internal trait. User must reuse internal implementation with ink! messages. Our macro will simplify it). It will simplify the code structure and usage. |
| 2.     | Derive for storages                                 | We will provide a derive macro to generate implementation for storage's structs. It will simplify integration of fields inside of struct and implementation of storage's traits for that fields. |
| 3.     | Support default implementation in external traits   | We will add mnemonic support of default implementations inside of trait definition(traits defined via `#[ink::trait_definition]`). It is mnemonic, because under the hood we will generate internal trait with default implementation that will be used in external trait.  |
| 4.     | Support of modifiers                                | We will add support of modifiers, like in Solidity. User will be able to mark some function to use modifiers and it will simplify the code. |
| 5.     | ReentrancyGuard                                     | We will add implementation of [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol) |
| 6.     | Implement additional useful contract                | We will implement [PaymentSplitter](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/finance/PaymentSplitter.sol), [TimelockController](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/governance/TimelockController.sol) and etc. |

### Current work - Scope of this Grant

#### Milestone 3. Reduce the size of Erc20 contract.

| 1.     | Reduce the size of Erc20 contract                        | Now the most critical moment with ink! is the huge size of contracts. [This issue](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/issues/9354) described the problem very well. The parity team works in this direction, and we want to help with ink! side. The ink! team created issue [906](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/906), [916](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/916) and [910](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/issues/910). We want to briefly(not full change, only minimal changes to reduce the size) implement them and provide a report(re-working data structure, reducing monomorphization, using dynamic dispatch in some cases). Based on this report, the ink! team can decide how better to implement them and which part is more critical. During the implementation, we will build examples with our version of ink! (also maybe we will modify some sub-crates). So the output of this work is a report and custom version of ink!. The code can be reused, or if ink! team agrees we can try to implement these issues by ourselves later as separate work.             |

#### Milestone 4. Pre-release - Standardization of tokens contracts. Implement extensions for contracts. Documentation.

| 4.     | Use original ink! instead of our own                                | We will use ink! `3.0-rc6` version(or a new one if it will be compatible) instead of our own version of ink!.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 5.     | Refactor the contracts to be compatible with PSPs                   | We will refactor the contracts according to the PSP.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 6.     | Refactor the structure of the OpenBrush to provide agnostic traits  | We will refactor the structure of the OpenBrush to provide traits for each implementation of the contract without restriction and implementation related information:<br/> - Traits will be defined in a separate module.<br/> - The default implementation of that trait for a contract will be provided via unstable feature `#![feature(min_specialization)]`.<br/> - We will provide a new macro to generate a wrapper around a trait. That wrapper can be used for cross-contract calls. So the user is enough of the trait definition to do a cross contract call. |

## Future Plans

After, this Grant, we will create a grant related to upgradable contracts.

We're going to make a strong impact in the community, making ink! simple and convenient for developers.
- Expertise sharing
  - Covering all crypto-related news websites, creating workshops online, handling all relevant forums and social networks
- Becoming an entry point for a developer starting in ink!/Wasm
  - Nonstop updating our FAQ and knowledge base, creating educational content (text\video)
- Marketing and PR strategy
  - Organizing hackathons, Developing growth hacking strategy for involving developers from different channels


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:
In the roadmap, you can see what was already done. Currently, we're on the 3-rd milestone.

We have applied and got the [grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/497) to cover 1 and 2 milestones. This grant is a follow-up grant.
