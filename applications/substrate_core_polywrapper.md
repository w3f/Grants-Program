## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

For this proposal, we'll be developing:
1. **Substrate Core Polywrapper:** Polywrapper in Rust that enables users to interact with substrate-based chains using any language on any platform.
2. **Developer Documentation:** Documentation showing developers how they can use the substrate core wrapper within their dapps and wrappers.

In the future, we'd like to continue this work by developing:
1. **Token Balance Interface:** Polywrap standard interface that defines common functionality for all pallets supporting "balances".
2. **Balances Implementation Wrapper:** An implementation of the "Token Balance" interface that interacts with the [Balances pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/balances)'s ABI.
3. **[Pallet ABI -> Polywrapper] Codegenerator:** A code generator that generates Polywrap code based on a Pallet's ABI (leveraging the [chain's metadata](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8615)).
4. **Developer Documentation:** Documentation showing developers how they can use the Balance wrapper, implement their own Balances implementation, and generate Polywrappers from pallet ABIs.

Future proposals will be made for the above. Below we'll explain the work in its entirety.

**About Polywrap:**
Polywrap is a dev toolchain that enables easy integration of Web3 protocols into any application. It makes it possible for software on any device, written in any language, to read and write data to Web3 protocols.

### Project Details

Polywrapper will be written in Rust and compiled to WASM so that it can be used by developers to call substrate methods by simply invoking graphql calls. We will deploy Substrate Polywrapper to the IPFS.

Project heavily relies on the Polywrap toolchain and Polywrap team support.

### Ecosystem Fit
* **Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?**
  
  Polywrap will allow polkadot dapp developers to integrate protocol logic into dapps in a simple, familiar way, regardless of their implementation language.

  Additionally it will enable a new "standardization layer" for dapps developers to use, enabling the aggregation of multiple similar-but-different chains. The first standard interface we'll be developing in the future will be the "token balance" interface. We will create an implementation of this interface for the [Substrate Balance Pallet](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/tree/master/frame/balances).


* **Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?**

  Our initial target audiences are dapp/wallet developers, as well as the broader web3 developer ecosystem since Polywrap is architected in a chain-agnostic way. We'll be working with the [Talisman](https://talisman.xyz/) team to ensure the work we're doing aligns with their wallet's needs. We've already had preliminary conversations with them, and they're excited to work with the software we build for this grant.
  
  Additionally the Talisman team has confirmed that, if this Polywrap integration suites their needs like they/we think it will, they are willing to help contribute to the codebase(s) going forward along with ChainSafe and the Polywrap DAO.

* **What need(s) does your project meet?**
  
  Polywrap meets the needs of dapp developers who want a simple way to integrate protocol logic into their dapps.  The Polywrap integration experience should be extremely familiar to any develop who has integrated a Web 2.0 API.  The dapp dev simply needs to add the Polywrap client into their dapp, and then they will be able to send GraphQL queries to an endpoint to execute protocol functions.
  
  Additionally, as previously stated, we've noticed that in the multi-para-chain future there is a need for another layer of standardization. This is because pallet ABIs may be different amongst multiple chains, but be effectively serving the same purpose (Tokens, AMMs, Profiles, Governance, etc). With Polywrap developers can create standard interfaces that can be implemented in many different ways, depending on the pallet being used. The dapp developer simply uses the standard interface methods/types, and doesn't have to care about the implementation details of the chain/pallet. We feel that this goes hand-in-hand with the ["enriched metadata & typeinfo"](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8615) feature that was recently merged.
  
  Lastly, it's worth noting that polywrappers can be downloaded and executed at run-time due to the security and portability of WebAssembly. This means that dapps using the "Token Balance" interface can potentially update themselves without having to be rebuilt, dynamically supporting new chains as they come online.

* **Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**

  There are not other projects solving the integration issue today at the SDK layer. As previously mentioned, the ["enriched metadata & typeinfo"](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/pull/8615) PR solves the introspection problem at the chain-level, but there is more to do farther down the integration pipeline at the dapp level. This is where Polywrap will help.

| 1. | Schema Definitions | Described below |
| 2. | `substrate-signer-provider` Polywrap Client JavaScript Plugin | Described below |
| 3. | `substrate-core` Wrapper | Described below |

> NOTE: 2 & 3 can be developed in parallel once schemas are defined.

### 1. Schema Definitions

There will be 2 Polywrap schemas:
- `substrate-signer-provider` - Low-level interface for accessing the application's configureable signer / provider.
- `substrate-core` - Higher-level interface for interacting with a substrate based chain. This depends upon on an implementation of the substrate-signer-provider interface above.

To get a better idea of what this "separation of concerns" looks like in practice, please refer to [this example specification](https://github.com/polywrap/integrations/blob/main/near/Near%20Polywrapper%20Specification.md#near-polywrapper-specification) for the Polywrap <> Near integration that's actively being developed.

### 2. `substrate-signer-provider` JavaScript Plugin

A JavaScript plugin is necessary to perform the following actions that cannot be implemented directly within a Polywrapper due to limitations of WASM, and security best-practices:
* Filesystem interaction, such as reading and writing to local keystores
* Browser interaction, including interaction with the Polkadot.js Wallet
* Sending RPC requests, through the application's configurable providers
* Likewise, Polywrapper execution is stateless and therefore the plugin is used to cache the network configuration parameters provided when instantiating the plugin. Configuration items can include a network and wallet settings, as well as optional data developers might provide when instantiating a Polkadot.js class instance.

The plugin would typically be instantiated and configured when instantiating the Polywrap Client, like so:
```typescript
import {
  substratePlugin
} from "substrate-signer-provider-plugin-js";

const client = new Web3ApiClient({
  plugins: [{
    uri: "plugin/substrate-signer-provider",
    plugin: substratePlugin({
      // Can include Polkadot.js instance here
      ...
    })
  }]
})
```

To get an idea of what the `substrate-signer-provider` schema might look like, please see the Near plugin's schema [here](https://github.com/polywrap/integrations/blob/main/near/Near%20Polywrapper%20Specification.md#near-javascript-plugin).

### 3. `substrate-core` Wrapper

The Polywrapper is a set of WASM modules that contain the bulk of the logic needed to interact with substrate based chains. The Polywrapper calls the aforementioned JavaScript Plugin only when necessary to perform specific tasks.

A call to the Polywrapper might look something like this (TS/JS application):
```typescript
import { Header } from "./polywrap-codegen/substrate-core";

const result = await client.invoke<Header>({
  uri: "/ens/substrate-core.eth",
  module: "query",
  method: "getHeader"
  input: {
    hash: "0x1c54f419aa058319b198142ece3a625989f8cea01f80bd6110c0fd10c1e6cc3e",
  }
});
```

A Polywrapper can have two WASM modules--a "Mutation" module and a "Query" module. As the names imply, functions in the Mutation module may change on-chain state while Query functions do not.

The core methods that will be worked on for this proposal will be:
- author_submitExtrinsic
- chain_getBlockHash
- chain_getHeader
- chain_getFinalizedHead
- chain_getBlock
- state_getStorage
- state_queryStorage
- state_queryStorageAt
- state_getMetadata
- state_getRuntimeVersion
- system_properties

We will be heavily leverage existing Rust crates in the substrate developer ecosystem to implement the wrapper detailed above.

## Future Plans

As stated above, we'd like to continue to build upon the work done within this proposal, by enabling multi-chain token balance aggregation (through the use of Polywrap interfaces).

We hope that with this work complete, a team like Talisman will be able to continuing using the tooling we've developed to fully realize their vision of having a fully featured multi-para-chain wallet.

The work created by this grant will be stewarded by the ChainSafe & Polywrap DAO teams, as well as the Talisman team if they decide to build upon what we've created.
