- **Payment Address:** 1scixS3ofLuBN8XEQQdSjMQaLtvvbcJiQAqpnaov8xopX78
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

ArtZero & InkWhale team is developing a decentralized LaunchPad using Ink! Smart Contract. All the work will be available for the public to reuse on Github. The project is being built and tested on Aleph Zero network but can be deployed on any parachains or Substrate-based blockchains that support Ink! such as Astar, Aleph Zero and 5ireChain. 


### Overview

### Project Details

After successful Grant Delivery of ArtZero and InkWhale as well as successful launch of NFT Marketplace ArtZero. We would like to create more useful dapps for the ecosystem, not only for us to use but for the public to see how powerfull Ink! Smart Contract is. This decentralized LaunchPad is the first LaunchPad developed using Ink!

The LaunchPad will allow project owner to distribute standard PSP22 tokens to anyone who wants to participate in the project. Features include:
- Only token contract owner can create a new Project for existing PSP22 tokens.
- Full Project Information saved on-chain via IPFS such as: project name, description, social media, project images, project roadmap, project milestones, team, tokenomics and sale phases;
- Multiple Sale Phases with Vesting Plan, Public/Private Sale; Price is set for each public phase; Vesting Plan include Immediate Release Rate; Vesting Duration adn Vesting Release Period;
- Support Whitelist for each sale phase with seperate price and amount for each address. This feature can be integrated with KYC where there are laws and obligations to comply with.

### Ecosystem Fit

We think that the launchpad will help the ecosystem grow faster because it helps project owners to: raising funds with minimal efforts and all transactions are secured and transparent which are vital for the public;

All work including Front-end; Back-end and Smart Contract work are available publicly which allow new Ink! developers to re-use the code and to learn quicker.

We believe in the future of Ink! Smart Contract and want to have your support to build this project because LaunchPad is an important element in every blockchain.

We plan to have external audit of the code in the future but the audit is out of scope in this proposal.
