Project Overview 📄

Overview

Tagline: The World’s First Decentralized AI Greenhouse.

Description: Petalnet is a confidential AI compute marketplace. We bridge the gap between high-end GPU supply (gamers in Asia/North America and Big-Tech idle capacity) and the growing demand for private AI processing in global markets, specifically North America and the Middle East.

Ecosystem Fit: Petalnet is built to be a primary consumer of Polkadot JAM (Join-Accumulate Machine) and Agile Coretime. We integrate with Phala Network for hardware-level encryption (TEEs) to ensure data privacy.

Interest: As a founder in Canada, I see a massive "Privacy Gap" where businesses cannot use AI because they fear data leaks. I am building Petalnet to make Polkadot the "Global Supercomputer" for secure AI.

Project Details

Architecture: Petalnet acts as a routing layer. It encrypts AI tasks, sends them to "Gardener" nodes (GPUs), and settles payments via PolkaPay.

Tech Stack: Polkadot JAM, Phala TEEs (Phat Contracts), Substrate, and PolkaPay.

Mockups: Initial wireframes and brand concepts are available at Petalnet.ca.

Scope Limits: Petalnet is a compute marketplace; it does not develop its own LLMs (it hosts open-source models like Llama 3/4).

Ecosystem Fit

Target Audience: Enterprise businesses needing private AI (Medical, Legal, Gov) and Global Gamers (GPU providers).

Need: High GPU costs and lack of privacy in centralized AI clouds.

Uniqueness: Unlike other compute projects (e.g., Akash), Petalnet focuses on Confidential Computing using Polkadot's unique multi-core architecture (JAM), ensuring the provider never sees the user's data.

Future Plans
Petalnet intends to become a self-sustaining marketplace. Once the prototype is built, we will transition to a Level 2 grant to fund full-scale development and a "Decentralized Futures" bid to hire a full engineering team.

Additional Information ➕
How did you hear about the Grants Program? Polkadot Community Forum. This is a solo-founder initiative born out of the need for private AI infrastructure in North America and beyond.
