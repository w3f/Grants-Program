**Step into the future of property management with Verydorm  where blockchain meets trust, security, and prosperity.**

  

### Overview

  
Verydorm is a decentralized platform aimed at transforming property management and real estate transactions, especially in developing and emerging nations. By leveraging blockchain technology, Verydorm solves problems like property fraud, lack of transparency in land records, and inefficiencies in renting and property maintenance. The platform enables secure listings, immutable property records, automated rent collection, and end-to-end property lifecycle management.

  

### Project Details

  

### Problem Statement
Real estate issues in developing countries include:
- Widespread property fraud and unverified listings
- Inaccessible or tampered land records
- Inefficient processes for rentals, rent collection, and maintenance
- Lack of tenant identity verification and landlord accountability

### Proposed Solution
Verydorm provides a decentralized, secure platform offering:
- **Verified Property Listings** ‚Äì Owners list with verified documentation.
- **Blockchain Property Records** ‚Äì Immutable and auditable.
- **Tenant & Property Management** ‚Äì Rent, legal tools, screening, repairs.
- **Verydorm Coin (Token)** ‚Äì Native token for transactions, verifications, and fees.

![Verydorm Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/speedily/dummypics/refs/heads/main/ummsequence.png)
UML diagrams demonstrate application use cases such as blockchain property records, property search, and property management.

### Technical Architecture
- **Frontend:** Javascript, React + Material UI 
- **Backend:** Node.js, Firebase  
- **Blockchain:** Solidity smart contracts, hardhat on Base blockchain(Previously). This Will Be Migrated To Polkadot Blockchain
- **Token Utility:** Verydorm Coin for all in-platform operations (rent, verification, fees, staking)
 

### Ecosystem Fit

  


Verydorm is uniquely positioned within the intersection of blockchain technology and the real estate sector, particularly targeting challenges prevalent in developing and emerging economies. The project complements and strengthens the broader blockchain ecosystem by applying decentralization, transparency, and tokenization to a traditionally opaque and centralized industry‚Äîproperty management.
While blockchain has seen applications in DeFi, identity, and supply chain, Verydorm brings innovation to the underexplored domain of real estate management. By leveraging smart contracts on the Base blockchain (with future plans to integrate with Polkadot), Verydorm introduces trustless property listings, immutable ownership records, and automated rent transactions‚Äîbridging the gap between Web3 infrastructure and real-world utility.
Unlike most crypto or blockchain platforms that focus on speculative financial products, Verydorm directly addresses real-world pain points such as property fraud, tenant verification, and inefficiencies in property maintenance. This increases the appeal of Web3 solutions to everyday users‚Äîlandlords, tenants, and property managers‚Äîwho may not yet be exposed to blockchain technology.
Moreover, the introduction of Verydorm Coin as a utility token for rent, verification, staking, and service fees creates a self-sustaining micro-economy that aligns incentives across stakeholders. It also opens opportunities for deeper integration with other decentralized identity, DeFi, and governance protocols.
In the broader Web3 and real estate ecosystem, Verydorm fills a vital niche‚Äîproviding infrastructure and tools where centralized systems have failed or remain inaccessible. Its focus on high-impact markets like Kenya, Nigeria, and India makes it a valuable addition to the global blockchain landscape, advancing adoption where the need is greatest.

- Here is a bar chart illustrating the essential features that the Verydorm platform should include, rated on a scale from 0 to 160. Each yellow bar represents the relative importance or emphasis placed on a feature based on the content of the grant application. Let me know if you'd like to adjust the scale, colors, or add/export the chart.  

### **Pie Chart:**

- Here's the pie chart showing the level of agreement among members of Kenya's investment departments on accepting property records on the
blockchain. The majority (in green) support the idea, while a smaller portion (in orange) do not. Let me know if you'd like to add actual survey data, labels, or use this in a report.

**PropertyProof** 

PropertyProof is the first version of Verydorm - [Web](https://devfolio.co/projects/propertyproof-e8a2), [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FM8dNKjQhdU). A decentralized platform ensuring secure, transparent, and fraud-proof property ownership through blockchain technology with base layer. With the help of Base, Propertyproof is tackling these challenges by providing a decentralized platform for transparent, secure, and tamper-proof property ownership records. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, we aim to eliminate intermediaries, reduce corruption, and empower individuals to verify property ownership directly. The platform also addresses issues like slow bureaucratic processes, errors in record-keeping, and inefficiencies in land administration systems.
Base‚Äôs Layer 2 solution plays a key role in making this possible. It enhances the scalability and performance of the platform, ensuring low transaction fees and faster processing times. This enables Propertyproof to serve a larger user base, ensuring accessibility for everyone, from local communities to NGOs and governmental bodies, without the high costs often associated with blockchain transactions.
By addressing these challenges, we aim to restore trust in property ownership systems, protect individuals' rights, and ultimately contribute to more transparent governance and economic development in the community.
