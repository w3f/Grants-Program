## Project Details :bulb:

### Tag Line

"Rediscover Reading Online. Secure. Private. Decentralized."

### Brief Description

Dexel is not just another bookmarking tool; it's a reimagined digital reading experience built on the Polkadot network. Designed with a focus on user-centricity, Dexel allows users to save online content effortlessly, categorizing it into Video, Project, or Article cards. Each saved content piece can be revisited in a personalized reading environment, with customization options at the user's fingertips. At its core, Dexel ensures data security and privacy through decentralized storage and smart contracts, empowering users to have full ownership and control over their data.

### Ecosystem Fit

As the Polkadot ecosystem matures, there's a growing demand for dApps that are not only decentralized but also prioritize user experience and practical utility. Dexel addresses this by melding the benefits of Polkadot's scalability, security, and interoperability with a tangible everyday use-case: saving and reading online content. The platform's integration with Polkadot allows for potential future collaborations with other parachains, opening avenues for enhanced features and cross-chain functionalities. By offering a decentralized alternative to mainstream "read it later" apps, Dexel fills a niche yet essential gap in the Polkadot dApp landscape.

### Design and User Experience

Our design philosophy is rooted in user-centricity and simplicity. With a clean interface and intuitive navigation, Dexel ensures users can effortlessly save and manage their content. Our Figma design offers a visual representation of the platform's aesthetics and functionality.

### Smart Contract Architecture

Our smart contract architecture is built using the Ink! framework. Our goal is to build a modular contract system where each module (or contract) will handle specific functionalities, allowing for better scalability, manageability, and upgradability.

- **User Management Contract (UMC)**
- **Content Management Contract (CMC)**
- **Customization & Preferences Contract (CPC)**

#### 2. Data Flows and Interactions

**2.1 User Authenticationn**

- User interacts with the frontend and opts to authenticate.
- The frontend communicates with the UMC to initiate the process.
- UMC interacts with the user's Polkadot wallet for authentication.
- Upon successful authentication, UMC stores user-specific keys and other necessary data on-chain.

**2.2 Saving Content**

- User pastes a URL on the frontend to be saved.
- Frontend communicates with the CMC to process this request.
- CMC fetches content linked to the URL, categorizes it, and stores the content reference (and metadata) on the Crust Network.
- The reference (or content ID) from Crust Network is then saved on-chain within the CMC, linked to the user's ID.

**2.3 Reading Content**

- User requests to read saved content via the frontend.
- Frontend communicates with the CMC to fetch the content reference for the user.
- The content itself is fetched from the Crust Network using the reference.
- Any customization preferences (like font, background) are fetched from the CPC.
- The content is then presented to the user as per their customization preferences.

**2.4 Setting Customization Preferences**

- User sets their reading preferences on the frontend.
- These preferences are then communicated to the CPC.
- CPC stores these preferences on-chain linked to the user's ID.


#### 3. Contract Interactions

**UMC**:

- Interacts with the user's Polkadot wallet for authentication.
- Stores user-specific details on-chain.

**CMC**:

- Responsible for content categorization.
- Interacts with the Crust Network for content storage and retrieval.
- Maintains on-chain references to content stored on the Crust Network.

**CPC**:

- Stores user customization preferences on-chain.
- Provides these preferences when requested.


#### 4. Security Mechanisms

Given the nature of the application, certain security mechanisms are crucial:

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent any spam or DDoS attacks on the contract functions.
- **Data Validation**: Ensure that any data (like URLs) provided to the contracts is valid and safe.
- **Upgradability**: Design contracts such that they can be upgraded in the future without data loss or major disruptions.

This architecture and data flow provide a robust and scalable foundation for Dexel's functionalities. However, as with all technical designs, it's essential to undergo thorough testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and security audits, especially given the decentralized and financial nature of the platform.

By leveraging the benefits of Polkadot's interoperability and scalability, our smart contracts would ensure efficient operations, reduced gas fees, and enhanced security.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: 
  - **Contracts**: We'll use the built-in testing framework that comes with the Ink! platform to ensure each function behaves as expected.
  - **UI**: We'll employ `Jest` combined with `React Testing Library` to test individual components and their interactions.

- **Integration Tests**: These tests will ensure the frontend and smart contracts work seamlessly together, providing users with real-time feedback and updates.

- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: We're considering using `Cypress` for real user scenarios from start to finish, ensuring the entire application works correctly.


## Future Plans :rocket:

Post the initial launch and deployment of Dexel, we have a strategic vision to ensure its sustained growth and relevance in the decentralized web ecosystem:

1. **Community Building**: Engage with our users through feedback sessions, ensuring the platform evolves based on their needs and preferences.
  
2. **Cross-Chain Integrations**: Explore potential collaborations within the Polkadot ecosystem, enhancing Dexel's capabilities and expanding its reach.
  
3. **Mobile Experience**: Recognizing the ubiquity of mobile users, we'll consider optimizing Dexel for mobile platforms, ensuring accessibility and convenience.
  
4. **Security Enhancements**: Continuously audit and refine the platform's security, ensuring user data remains protected against evolving threats.

Our journey with Dexel is a continuous one, and while we're ambitious, we're also grounded in our approach. We believe in growing organically, prioritizing user needs, and ensuring the platform's integrity at every step.
