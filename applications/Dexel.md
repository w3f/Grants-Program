## Project Details :bulb:

### Tag Line

"Rediscover Reading Online. Secure. Private. Decentralized."

### Brief Description

Dexel is not just another bookmarking tool; it's a reimagined digital reading experience built on the Polkadot network. Designed with a focus on user-centricity, Dexel allows users to save online content effortlessly, categorizing it into Video, Project, or Article cards. Each saved content piece can be revisited in a personalized reading environment, with customization options at the user's fingertips. At its core, Dexel ensures data security and privacy through decentralized storage and smart contracts, empowering users to have full ownership and control over their data.

### Ecosystem Fit

As the Polkadot ecosystem matures, there's a growing demand for dApps that are not only decentralized but also prioritize user experience and practical utility. Dexel addresses this by melding the benefits of Polkadot's scalability, security, and interoperability with a tangible everyday use-case: saving and reading online content. The platform's integration with Polkadot allows for potential future collaborations with other parachains, opening avenues for enhanced features and cross-chain functionalities. By offering a decentralized alternative to mainstream "read it later" apps, Dexel fills a niche yet essential gap in the Polkadot dApp landscape.

### Design and User Experience

Our design philosophy is rooted in user-centricity and simplicity. With a clean interface and intuitive navigation, Dexel ensures users can effortlessly save and manage their content. Our Figma design offers a visual representation of the platform's aesthetics and functionality.

### Smart Contract Architecture

Our smart contract architecture is built using the Ink! framework tailored for the Polkadot ecosystem. The UMC handles user registration, login, and profile management, ensuring data privacy and security. The CMC focuses on content management, including saving URLs, categorizing them, and ensuring data is retrievable in a user-friendly format. Both contracts work in tandem, providing a holistic solution for users to manage their reading experience on Dexel seamlessly.

By leveraging the benefits of Polkadot's interoperability and scalability, our smart contracts ensure efficient operations, reduced gas fees, and enhanced security.
