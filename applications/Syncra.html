As a protocols owner, the cost of development, voting mechanisms, and legal structure can be significant. On substrate such templates like ones in OpenZeppelin aren’t even available yet for DAO development. This means even more time required for research and development in this technology.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details">Project Details<a href="#project-details" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h3><p>Syncra simplifies this process. We&#x27;re working on a no-code solution to create, manage, and build your decentralized organization. Our goal is to provide a seamless process where protocol owners can launch the DAO within 5 minutes or even less.</p><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/Pe1Z26r.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>Transparency is inherent in blockchain technology, but many situations require privacy, especially in DAOs when it comes to tough decisions. Also in times when connecting particular wallet address to a person or entity can by relatively easy, or even required (KYC, ID verification, Identity providers). With Syncra, we want to provide a solution for confidential voting where votes are hidden by default, but everything happens on-chain. Leveraging a modular approach, we want to enhance privacy, provide an easy way for treasury management, and offer on-chain automation, ultimately providing this service for the entire Substrate ecosystem.</p><p>Having Syncra in the PolkaDOT ecosystem is a necessary piece of the puzzle. Just as Tally, Aragon, and Snapshot exist on EVM, Syncra exists on Substrate.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="product-overview">Product overview<a href="#product-overview" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Product overview" title="Direct link to Product overview">​</a></h3><p>We&#x27;ve already prepared and begun implementing some of our product designs.

Be aware that this is just a concept, none of the contracts have been properly tested and/or audited, and all the work is still experimental.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-it-work">How does it work?<a href="#how-does-it-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does it work?" title="Direct link to How does it work?">​</a></h3><p>The traits with default implementations consists of:</p><ul><li><strong>Votes</strong> - trait that provides 3 basic methods that allow to get voting power for of an address and delegate votes. The default implementation is done with combination of PSP22 token. However, <strong>Votes</strong> can represent any type of the &quot;strategy&quot; (for example PSP34-based).</li><li><strong>Governor</strong> - extends <strong>Votes</strong> and <strong>AccessControl</strong>. The base for the DAO. Provides proposal creation and execution functionalities.</li><li><strong>Timelock</strong> - extends <strong>Governor</strong>. Allows scheduling operations, for example to allow some time between voting end-time and proposal execution.</li><li><strong>ShieldedVoting</strong> - extends <strong>Governor</strong>. Allows to represent the &quot;votes&quot; by PSP22 token that can be shielded using Shielder contract.</li></ul><p><img loading="lazy" src="https://i.imgur.com/aRwOgbR.png" class="img_ev3q"></p><p>In the future, we plan to develop multi-chain treasury module to increase functionality and customisability.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-voting-work">How does voting work?<a href="#how-does-voting-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does voting work?" title="Direct link to How does voting work?">​</a></h3><p>For not shielded voting process, users can simply call <code>cast_vote(proposal_id)</code> method on the <strong>Governor</strong> contract. The vote power is calculated by <code>get_votes(account)</code>.</p><p>For shielded voting, users have to first &quot;register&quot; for voting to mint the PSP22 tokens representing their votes. Then, the tokens representing the votes can be simply transferred to an address representing one of the voting options or the transaction can be &quot;shielded&quot; using the Shielder contract.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-does-on-chain-automation-work">How does on-chain automation work?<a href="#how-does-on-chain-automation-work" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How does on-chain automation work?" title="Direct link to How does on-chain automation work?">​</a></h3><p>Smart Contracts, Blockchain, and DAOs are very often promoted as Autonomous solutions. However, there is still a need for a manual trigger from user, to execute a given action onchain. </p><p>At Syncra, we aim to deliver a complete automation with automatic Smart Contracts call execution. For this purposes we have started working a tool called Polkadot Smart Contracts Caller, which source code can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/KowalewskiPawel/Substrate-Polkadot-Smart-Contracts-Caller" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/KowalewskiPawel/Substrate-Polkadot-Smart-Contracts-Caller</a></p><p>With Polkadot Smart Contracts Caller, we can easily create a relayer service, for delegating Smart Contracts calls. In this scope, we are planning to add scheduler, and frontend implementation, so that tasks such as execution of the proposal can be scheduled, and called automatically after the end of voting period. </p><p>Moreover, we are also planning to integrate this tool in the Private Voting feature, so that &quot;withdraw&quot; function can be called from a neutral account, without revealing any sensitive info about the original caller.</p><p>Known drawbacks are the security concerns, related with storing private keys on the cloud. We are currently conducting the Security research, on a possible solution to this problem. Therefore, for the scope of the grant, we treat this feature rather more like a Proof of Concept, than final product or even MVP.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="data-model">Data Model<a href="#data-model" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Data Model" title="Direct link to Data Model">​</a></h3><p>Syncra uses IPFS as well as MongoDB for storing additional data about DAOs, proposals, and user stats. The purpose is to minimise the data footprint on the blockchain itself, as storing data onchain is costly, and not very performant. Only the critical data is stored inside of the the DAO Smart Contract’s. </p><p>DAOs, Proposals titles, and descriptions are stored on the IPFS, and then corresponding IPFS hashes are set on the DAO contract&#x27;s storage. In this way, users can be sure that the data about the given DAO or Proposal won’t be modified, nor fade-away if the server ever goes down. The same applies to storing images, as we use web3 storage for image upload.</p><p>To sum up, on the Syncra MongoDB side, general info about user/platform stats are stored, such as number of DAOs created, DAOs that the given user is involved in, etc. In this way, everyone can use our SDK or even connect directly with the DAO previously deployed via Syncra platform, and build own frontend dedicated to the given DAO, without losing the critical data, and need to connect with Syncra&#x27;s database.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="project-details-1">Project Details<a href="#project-details-1" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Project Details" title="Direct link to Project Details">​</a></h2><p>In the scope of this grant, several core parts will be implemented, as the extension of the pre-grant MVP product, built under AlephZero grant.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="mvp-pre-grant">MVP (Pre-Grant)<a href="#mvp-pre-grant" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to MVP (Pre-Grant)" title="Direct link to MVP (Pre-Grant)">​</a></h3><p>The MVP of the Syncra Platform, that we are going to start with, will consist the following parts:</p><ol><li>Frontend Application with the connection to Wallet, Smart Contracts, and Backend</li><li>Set of Smart Contracts based on PSP22 voting strategy</li><li>Backend for storing off-chain data, such as DAO and proposal&#x27;s additional info stored on IPFS.

Ideally, we plan to split the possible functionalities of a DAO into separate Rust traits, so that one can &quot;bootstrap&quot; the desired modules/functionalities and easily customize them. Moreover, our goal is to keep the project open for extension so in the future new modues/features could be added without the need to change existing standard. We will refactor the Smart Contracts code for creating DAOs and voting strategies, improve them, make more universal, and customizable so that they can be easily implemented. Additionally, we will prepare a documentation of each part, so that custom DAO contracts can be easily build from the ready puzzles. OpenZeppelins standards are the inspiration for this part, as there isn&#x27;t any similar standard on Polkadot ecosystem yet.</p></li><li><p><strong>On-chain Automation System Template</strong>
Smart contracts, even though considered autonomous, require a manual trigger from the user to execute certain functions. In ecosystems such as DAO, automatic execution of the proposals is something that is still missing. For this part we will create a template tool, that will work as off-chain worker for scheduling Smart Contracts calls. It will work as a simple application, with the Scheduler, and some relayer accounts, that contain tokens for covering gas costs. Scheduling certain actions, like for example mentioned above - executing proposal once they reach the deadline, will be possible by simply setting the call on the Smart Contract. The off-chain relayer, will read the state from the given smart contract, and then schedule the Smart Contract call.</p></li><li><p><strong>SDK</strong>
Our platform Syncra, is just one of the examples of how our infrastructure can be used, that is why we will create a set of ready solutions, so that a new platform (ex. frontend, mobile app, etc.) can be build, upon the pillars created by Syncra. In this part, a bundle for NPM and Yarn will be created, wrapping all core functionalities of Syncra. Developer will be able to simply install the SDK library in their project, setup the endpoints, and API KEYs for accessing our backend services, and then simply call given functions inside of their custom application.</p></li><li><p><strong>SDK Documentation</strong></p><p>  Dedicated documentation for the SDK will be created, so that the whole tool can be implemented with ease. We will also provide instructions for obtaining the necessary configuration keys, and other variables necessary to connect with our services.</p></li></ul><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="technology-stack">Technology stack<a href="#technology-stack" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Technology stack" title="Direct link to Technology stack">​</a></h4><p>Each of the core elements will be developed with certain set of technologies, and programming languages.</p><ol><li><strong>Smart Contracts as Governance Standards</strong>
Written in Rust with the use of <a href="https://github.com/paritytech/ink" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ink!</a> framework and <a href="https://github.com/727-Ventures/openbrush-contracts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">OpenBrush</a> library for PSP22 standard of tokens, as well as additional helper functions, such as modifier for checking the roles. The documentation will be developed using <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> framework, that leverages JavaScript and TypeScript.</li><li><strong>On-chain Automation System Template</strong>
Main technology stack here will be TypeScript, and Node.js Express for creating a server that can be deployed and hosted on most of the available hosting services. The reason behind this is the ease of implementation, and the availability of various libraries and technologies that can be added on top of it. This service won&#x27;t receive many calls, rather act as a relayer that reads data on-chain, and then submits data/send calls to Smart Contracts on-chain, without further need for external calls. As a core tool for creating calls to Smart Contracts, we will leverage <a href="https://polkadot.js.org/docs/api-contract" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Polkadot.js Contracts API</a>.</li><li><strong>SDK</strong>
JavaScript and TypeScript will be fundamental programming languages of this part, while <a href="/applications/npmjs.com">NPM</a> registry will be used for publishing the package itself. The SDK will be basically a wrapper of the certain functions that call Smart Contracts, and Backend. It will require the developer to add configuration, such as API Key to access our backend, Smart Contract Factory address, as well as the ABI files, that will serve as an instruction for calling each Smart Contract. We are not going to hardcode those in the SDK, as in the future, the platform may be deployed on different chains in the Polkadot ecosystem. Moreover, the Smart Contracts can be upgraded, or created with different set of rules and methods.</li><li><strong>SDK Documentation</strong>
The entire documentation for implementing SDK in the given project, will be built using <a href="https://docusaurus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Docusaurus</a> that leverages JavaScript and TypeScript.</li></ol><h4 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="hosting-and-infrastructure">Hosting and Infrastructure<a href="#hosting-and-infrastructure" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Hosting and Infrastructure" title="Direct link to Hosting and Infrastructure">​</a></h4><p>All of the code will be open-source, and available under our organizational repositories address</p><p><a href="https://github.com/orgs/SyncraDAO/repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Syncra Repositories</a></p><p>Frontend application from the MVP part will be available under the address below</p><p><a href="https://syncra.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">syncra.xyz</a></p><p>Example demo of on-chain automation service is going to be hosted most probably on the <a href="https://railway.app/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Railway</a> service, and it will connect with one of the instances of Data Base, hosted on the <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Atlas MongoDB</a> service.

Nevertheless, it is worth noticing those potential fields, which could have been improved for better safety.</p><ul><li><p>Storing Account Private Keys for Off-Chain Automation Relayer - since for sending transactions to the Smart Contracts, we need an actual on-chain Address, the seeds for that account, has to be stored somewhere on the Cloud. In this way, no human interaction is needed to create a signature. In our solution, we have no other option then just store those keys on one of the Cloud services. In such scenarios, there is always a risk of a data breach, that could compromise the access to the account, with the access to the funds stored for covering gas fees on it.</p></li><li><p>Smart Contracts Security Hole - we expect our Smart Contracts to be initially audited by <a href="https://kudelskisecurity.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kudelski Security</a> as a part of AlephZero grant. However, there is still a risk that something will not be caught during the audit, and we will also extend those Smart Contracts during this Project as for the purpose of creating OpenZeppelins like standards. During the development, some additional security issues may occur.</p></li><li><p>Off-Chain Automation Relayer Operational Failure - Automation relayer work as a centralized service for executing the calls, if for some reason, it will stop operating, the scheduled action may not be executed. For that reason, we are considering deploying several instances of this relayer, on multiple services, with multiple accounts. In this way we should minimize the risk of the scheduled action, not being executed due to the relayer&#x27;s operational failure.</p></li></ul><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="ecosystem-fit">Ecosystem Fit<a href="#ecosystem-fit" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit" title="Direct link to Ecosystem Fit">​</a></h2><p>Given the importance of scalable, and customisable DAO infrastructure, which many protocols needs, we want to introduce Syncra.
