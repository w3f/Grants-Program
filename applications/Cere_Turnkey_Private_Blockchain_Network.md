# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Turnkey Private Standalone Blockchain Network
* **Proposer:** [Cere-Network](https://github.com/Cerebellum-Network)
* **Payment Address:** 18YjvEJq7PBvBvSRzxcV8UWAt6eUUx11eT 

## Project Description :page_facing_up:   

Cere Network is providing a Turnkey Private Standalone Blockchain Network for any enterprise, which can be easily plugged into any Polkadot/Substrate based Layer 1 chain, as a secondary chain. As a Substrate based Private Blockchain, the Turnkey Private Standalone Blockchain Network will ensure a higher level of security, privacy, and performance, allow own set of custom chain specifications that can be tuned based on enterprise needs and with features like fast tuning, pre-configured for feeless transactions, support a set of Smart Contracts which can distribute any derivative asset. The creation of custom derivative assets will automate the transfer to/from user wallets to application wallets by any/app brand, assets can be used as micropayments, loyalty points, discount vouchers, etc.   

Below we have the overview of all the key features that Turnkey Private Standalone Blockchain Network will support:   

* Secure Staking / User-onboarding by Application or any Business.
* Support One or more Derivative assets.
* A pluggable layer two solution, that can be plugged into any Substrate/Polkadot chain, compatibility with all Substrate/Polkadot networks to rollup assets (as a Layer 2) or facilitate x-network transfers.
* Store and exchange custom data with other Private Blockchain Networks.
* Work in conjunction with Cere Decentralized Data Cloud solution to store, share, analyze and predict.
* Pre-configured and optimized for feeless transactions and performance.
* Creation of custom derivative assets and automate the transfer to/from user wallets to app wallets by any/app brand:
* Assets to be used as micropayments, loyalty points, discount vouchers, etc.
* Optimization of batch user onboarding and transaction processing.
