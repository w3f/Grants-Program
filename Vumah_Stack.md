### Overview
**Vumah Labs â€” Building Africaâ€™s Trust Infrastructure with AI and Zero-Knowledge Proofs on Polkadot.**

Vumah Labs is building the **Vumah ZK Trust Stack**, an open framework for authentic and verifiable digital content on Polkadot.  
The stack includes **Kweli**, an AI-powered deepfake detection and verification platform, the **Vumah SDK**, which enables developers to embed content authenticity and zero-knowledge proof generation into their apps, and the **Vumah RailKit SDK**, which provides APIs for verifiable data exchange across parachains.  

Together, they form a trust infrastructure that enhances transparency, identity assurance, and ESG data integrity across media, governance, and financial sectors.

Our project integrates deeply with the Polkadot ecosystem by leveraging **Substrate** for modular blockchain development and deploying the Vumah ZK Trust Stack (Kweli, Vumah SDK, and RailKit SDK) as interoperable pallets and developer tools.  
The Kweli engine anchors AI-generated authenticity proofs on **Polkadot AssetHub**, while the SDKs enable cross-parachain verification of zero-knowledge proofs and digital identity attestations through integrations with **KILT Protocol**, **Proof of Personhood**, and **Frequency**.  

This architecture strengthens Polkadotâ€™s trust and data integrity layer, promotes responsible AI use, and generates tangible utility for the DOT token through verification, transaction, and data anchoring activities.

Our team is driven by the urgent need to restore trust in digital informationâ€”especially across Africa, where misinformation, identity fraud, and data manipulation have real social and governance impacts. Through Kweli and the Vumah ZK Trust Stack, weâ€™re building verifiable infrastructure that empowers users, journalists, and institutions to prove authenticity without sacrificing privacy.

We see Polkadot as the ideal ecosystem to scale this vision globally; its interoperability, strong identity frameworks, and privacy-preserving technologies align perfectly with our mission to create trustworthy, impact-driven Web3 solutions for real-world users.

## Data Models / API Specifications

The Vumah ZK Trust Stack exposes its core functionality through well-defined data models and RESTful APIs for seamless integration with Substrate-based chains.

### Core Data Entities
- **MediaVerification**: uploaded media details â€” uploader address, AI authenticity score, media hash, ZK proof, verification status.  
- **ProofRecords**: anchored cryptographic proofs â€” proof IDs, proof type (SNARK/STARK), tx hashes, verifier addresses.  
- **IdentityAttestations**: links verified identities (journalists, institutions, creators) to media/datasets via KILT & Proof of Personhood.  
- **AuditTrail**: logs every verification/validation event, generating measurable ESG data.

### API Endpoints
- `POST /upload` â†’ Upload media, receive authenticity score & media ID.  
- `GET /verify/:media_id` â†’ Retrieve verification results and ZK proof details.  
- `POST /attest` â†’ Submit identity attestations linked to verified records.  
- `GET /audit/:media_id` â†’ Request integrity and impact reports.  

### SDK Workflow
1. User uploads media via Kweli or Vumah SDK.  
2. AI engine evaluates authenticity and generates a ZK proof.  
3. RailKit SDK anchors proof & metadata on Polkadot AssetHub.  
4. Other parachains verify proofs via XCM cross-chain messaging.

## Core Components

### a. Kweli (AI & Proof Engine)
Processes user media to detect manipulation and generate authenticity proofs.  
Outputs: Authenticity score, ZK proof, and on-chain hash.

### b. Vumah SDK
Integration layer allowing developers to verify content & proofs via APIs.  
Supports TypeScript, Python, and Rust.

### c. RailKit SDK
Cross-parachain interoperability layer for proofs using **XCM**.

---

## System Architecture

1. User uploads content via Kweli UI or partner app.  
2. AI engine analyzes media â†’ produces authenticity score.  
3. ZK circuit generates proof without exposing content.  
4. Proof & hash anchored on Polkadot.  
5. SDKs enable proof verification & cross-chain sharing.  
6. Data feeds into ESG dashboards.

## Deployment Plan

| Phase | Duration | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **1** | 3 months | Deploy Kweli backend + Substrate module (testnet) |
| **2** | 1 month | Integrate Vumah SDK for institutional partners |
| **3** | 1 month | Deploy RailKit SDK with cross-chain proof propagation |
| **4** | â€” | Release developer documentation and open-source repos |

## Documentation to Be Published
- API & SDK documentation  
- Smart contract & runtime docs  
- Developer integration guide  
- Governance & sustainability report  
- ESG impact metrics guide

## Ecosystem Fit

Vumah Labs provides a **trust and data integrity layer** within Polkadotâ€”bridging AI verification, ZK proofs, and decentralized identity.

- **Target users:** parachain developers, dApp builders, journalists, and institutions.  
- **Need addressed:** misinformation, digital trust, privacy-preserving verification.  
- **Key difference:** combines AI + ZK + Substrate interoperability (vs. centralized or single-chain alternatives).
