### Office Hours

Web3 Foundation Grants Office Hours are a chance to ask the grants team questions regarding a specific (potential) grant application. It offers

- general guidance regarding the grants program,
- some quick initial feedback and
- help how to navigate the ecosystem.

Apply for Office Hours if you

- need feedback before submitting an application,
- want to find out what kind of support there might be available or
- need help finding the resources you need.

It is **not** a chance to pitch your project, especially since only a small subset of the committee will participate in the call. To apply, please fill out the [Office Hours :alarm_clock: form](https://forms.gle/54xkiqU37WwdN9UR6). Be as specific as possible, so we can help you more quickly. We will get back to you with follow-up questions or a link for booking a timeslot.
