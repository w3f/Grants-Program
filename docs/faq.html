As such, we don&#x27;t usually fund tangential costs such as business-oriented activities (marketing, business planning), events or outreach, and—for non-infrastructure projects—deployment and hosting costs, maintenance or audits. We also expect you to have a good understanding of the technologies you are planning to use, meaning that we don&#x27;t fund time spent learning how to use Substrate or how to write ink! smart contracts.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-anyone-apply">Can anyone apply?<a href="#can-anyone-apply" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can anyone apply?" title="Direct link to Can anyone apply?">​</a></h3><p>  Projects for which a token sale has been or is being conducted are not eligible for a Web3 Foundation grant.

As long as you meet the code’s license, we encourage you to find, modify and contribute to already existing libraries and projects if it is of use for your project. However, we expect you to honour other people’s work and their right to attribution, and your published code to adhere to the license requirements of the code you are benefiting from. Submitting code as part of a milestone that violates someone else’s license will result in immediate termination. We will furthermore continue to monitor any repositories you may have submitted as part of a milestone for possible license infringements and reserve the right to terminate the grant if we find you going out of your way to hide external contributions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-am-starting-a-company-that--i-want-to-use-polkadotkusamasubstrate-to-build-a-blockchainparachain-and-connect--would-i-be-eligible-for-a-grant">I am starting a company that <!-- -->[...]<!-- -->.

However, if part of your work is to build a library or another piece of software that could be of interest to the general Polkadot/Kusama/Substrate ecosystem and ask for funding specific to that, we are happy to look into it.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-application-was-rejected-do-you-have-any-recommendations-on-where-to-go-from-here">My application was rejected.

If your application is highly technical or specialised, we might have to bring in an external evaluator. Sometimes, this specialised evaluator is busy with another evaluation. And sometimes, the committee is simply unsure or not quite convinced.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="️-application-process">🖊️ Application Process<a href="#️-application-process" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🖊️ Application Process" title="Direct link to 🖊️ Application Process">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-long-does-it-take-from-application-to-decision">How long does it take from application to decision?<a href="#how-long-does-it-take-from-application-to-decision" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How long does it take from application to decision?" title="Direct link to How long does it take from application to decision?">​</a></h3><p>  Depending on the requested amount, quality of the application and desirability for the ecosystem, a grant application could be approved within a week. Usually, there will be a discussion and requests for changes, additions or improvements. If no one in the committee finds the application approval-worthy or you don&#x27;t react to our comments, it will be closed after two weeks of inactivity. Very large grants require the approval of the council, which convenes once a month. Thus, once an editor declares your application sufficient, it may take up to one month until a decision is made.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-w3f-member-approved-my-application-does-that-mean-it-is-accepted">A W3F member approved my application.

Does that mean it is accepted?" title="Direct link to A W3F member approved my application. Does that mean it is accepted?">​</a></h3><p>  Depending on the size of the grant, applications require two to five committee members to approve it. Since we have many different members with different backgrounds and specializations, it is possible that the committee disagrees and your application gets rejected even though one or two members approved it.
The application is accepted once the pull request is merged.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-apply-if-i-want-to-keep-information-private-or-want-to-be-paid-in-fiat">How do I apply if I want to keep information private or want to be paid in fiat?<a href="#how-do-i-apply-if-i-want-to-keep-information-private-or-want-to-be-paid-in-fiat" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do I apply if I want to keep information private or want to be paid in fiat?" title="Direct link to How do I apply if I want to keep information private or want to be paid in fiat?">​</a></h3><p>  For special cases that do not fit the regular grants structure, we provide <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMfjiRmDQDRk-4OhNASM6BAKii7rz_B1jWtbCPkUh6N7M2ww/viewform" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a form</a>.

However, we are not interested in taking away your grant for any slight hiccup. More often than not, delays are part of the journey and do not constitute a reason for concern. The best way to handle changes in your plans is to get in touch with us. If you would like to prematurely end your work, we can amend your application and remove the milestones you won&#x27;t be able to complete. If you decide to continue work at a later date, you can always reapply for the remaining milestones and potentially adapt them to take into account any insights you have gained in the meantime.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-list-the-web3-foundation-as-a-partner">Can I list the Web3 Foundation as a partner?<a href="#can-i-list-the-web3-foundation-as-a-partner" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can I list the Web3 Foundation as a partner?" title="Direct link to Can I list the Web3 Foundation as a partner?">​</a></h3><p>  No. Once the grants team has accepted your first milestone, you may display our <a href="/Grants-Program/docs/Support Docs/grant-badge-guidelines">grants badge</a> in a project-specific context, such as the repository containing the grant project work.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-you-help-me-advertise-my-project">Can you help me advertise my project?<a href="#can-you-help-me-advertise-my-project" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can you help me advertise my project?" title="Direct link to Can you help me advertise my project?">​</a></h3><p>  The Web3 Foundation does not provide PR services to its grantees. However, once per month we co-promote announcements from grants that have delivered a milestone on <a href="https://twitter.com/Web3foundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. Note that the milestone needs to have been accepted prior to the announcement. Lastly, please observe our <a href="/Grants-Program/Support Docs/announcement-guidelines">announcement guidelines</a> for all grant-related communications. This document also lists an email address through which you can get in touch with our PR team for feedback and in case you have specific questions.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="i-found-one-of-my-deliverables-to-be-unnecessary-impossible-or-already-done-elsewhere-what-do-i-do">I found one of my deliverables to be unnecessary, impossible or already done elsewhere.

If you find parts of your original grant application to be unnecessary or you decide to pivot, but you still want to finish the project: get in touch with us. If your new plans are in line with the Web3 Foundation’s values and the council approves the amendment, you can continue your work. If your plans change significantly or you find yourself not being able to finish the grant, we can mutually agree to terminate the grant early. You are always welcome to reapply another time.</p><h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="-milestone-delivery">🚚 Milestone Delivery<a href="#-milestone-delivery" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 🚚 Milestone Delivery" title="Direct link to 🚚 Milestone Delivery">​</a></h2><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="how-do-i-submit-a-milestone">How do I submit a milestone?<a href="#how-do-i-submit-a-milestone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to How do I submit a milestone?" title="Direct link to How do I submit a milestone?">​</a></h3><p>  For details, please refer to the <a href="/Grants-Program/Support Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines">milestone delivery guidelines</a> for the respective grants program. Generally speaking, the most important part of a delivery is a list of <strong>the same deliverables listed in the application</strong> with links to their implementation/realisation (ideally pointing to a specific commit or tag, so you can continue working on your repository without messing up your delivery and complicating our evaluation) and any additional notes you might have. The list of deliverables for each of your milestones should be defined in your grant agreement.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-submit-two-or-more-milestones-at-once">Can I submit two or more milestones at once?<a href="#can-i-submit-two-or-more-milestones-at-once" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can I submit two or more milestones at once?" title="Direct link to Can I submit two or more milestones at once?">​</a></h3><p>  You can. However, we strongly encourage you to submit your work in increments (milestones), so that you can be sure we didn’t misunderstand (an aspect of) your application, and you didn&#x27;t make changes to your plan or delivery that would have required a reevaluation of the application.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="can-i-add-a-badge-to-my-repo-once-ive-completed-a-milestone">Can I add a badge to my repo once I’ve completed a milestone?<a href="#can-i-add-a-badge-to-my-repo-once-ive-completed-a-milestone" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Can I add a badge to my repo once I’ve completed a milestone?" title="Direct link to Can I add a badge to my repo once I’ve completed a milestone?">​</a></h3><p>  If yours is a <a href="/Grants-Program/Introduction/levels">Level 2 or 3</a> grant and your first milestone has been submitted <strong>and accepted</strong>, yes. Please make sure that you follow the <a href="/Grants-Program/Support Docs/grant-badge-guidelines">badge guidelines</a> when doing so.</p><h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-are-other-milestones-being-accepted-or-discussed-faster-than-mine">Why are other milestones being accepted or discussed faster than mine?<a href="#why-are-other-milestones-being-accepted-or-discussed-faster-than-mine" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Why are other milestones being accepted or discussed faster than mine?" title="Direct link to Why are other milestones being accepted or discussed faster than mine?">​</a></h3><p>  While we try to process deliveries chronologically, some milestones aren&#x27;t processed quite as fast as others. One obvious reason is the complexity of the delivery and its evaluation. Other times, your submission might require internal discussion or delegation. In any case, if you have any question on the processing of your delivery, you can reach out to us via email or Github.</p></div></article><nav class="pagination-nav docusaurus-mt-lg" aria-label="Docs pages navigation"></nav></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_bqdL thin-scrollbar theme-doc-toc-desktop"><ul class="table-of-contents table-of-contents__left-border"><li><a href="#-general" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">🧭 General</a><ul><li><a href="#how-much-can-i-ask-for" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">How much can I ask for?</a></li><li><a href="#what-activitiespositions-do-you-fund" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">What activities/positions do you fund?</a></li><li><a href="#can-anyone-apply" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Can anyone apply?</a></li><li><a href="#can-i-get-an-upfront-payment" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Can I get an upfront payment?</a></li><li><a href="#when-do-i-get-paid" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">When do I get paid?</a></li><li><a href="#can-i-reuse-someone-elses-open-source-code" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">Can I reuse someone else’s open-source code?</a></li><li><a href="#i-am-starting-a-company-that--i-want-to-use-polkadotkusamasubstrate-to-build-a-blockchainparachain-and-connect--would-i-be-eligible-for-a-grant" class="table-of-contents__link toc-highlight">I am starting a company that ....
