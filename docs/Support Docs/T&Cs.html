<p>To apply for the Web 3.0 Foundation Grants Program, your application shall fulfill the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>it shall be a research or software-based project, which contributes to the advancement of the Polkadot ecosystem;</li>
<li>the Software shall be released under the Apache license version 2.0.;</li>
<li>You must accept payment in DOT as well as USDT or USDC on Polkadot AssetHub or fiat;</li>
<li>You will need to submit the application and deliver the milestones according to the process specified below;</li>
</ul>
<p>The grants process consists of five parts, each of them described in more detail below:</p>
<p><strong>(i)  Grant application process:</strong></p>
<p>To apply for a grant of the Web 3.0  Foundation Grants Program, You shall comply with the procedures established in the README.md file under <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program</a> as well as the process defined inside this document.</p>
<p>To apply for a grant of the Web3 Foundation Grants Program, the grantee needs to fork (= create a copy on GitHub of) the Grants-Program GitHub repository. In the newly created fork (=copy on GitHub), the grantee has to create a copy of the application-template.md. The copied application-template.md needs to be renamed as &quot;project_name.md&quot;. &quot;Project_name&quot; needs to be replaced with the name of the project application. Additionally, the grantee has to fill out all mandatory parts of the application-template.md presented in bold letters. Once the grantees have completed the application, they need to create a new pull request (= in this case, a mechanism to submit the changes of the fork to the original Grants-Program GitHub repository) by clicking on the &quot;create new pull request&quot; button shown inside the fork of the W3F Grants-Program GitHub repository. After this, the grantee needs to sign off the terms and conditions presented via the CLA assistant.</p>
<p><strong>(ii)  Application review process:</strong></p>
<p>The Web 3.0 grants committee, which is specified on the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grants-Program GitHub repository</a>(the &quot;Grants Committee&quot;), can issue comments and request changes on the grant application pull request (the submission of the grant application on GitHub).  As soon enough members of the Grants Committee approve the pull request, the terms and conditions are signed off and all requested changes are addressed, the application is officially accepted. The application is now a part of the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3F Grants-Program GitHub repository</a>. The time point of the acceptance by the Grants Committee is hereby stored on GitHub and counts as the official beginning of the grant. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party.

<p><strong>(iii)  Milestone delivery process:</strong></p>
<p>To submit one of the possible multiple milestones specified in the application, You shall fork the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository</a> with the same Github account, used to submit the initial application. In the newly created fork, You shall create a copy of the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milestone-delivery-template.md</a>. Such <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milestone-delivery-template.md</a> needs to be renamed as &quot;project_name_milestone_number.md&quot;. &quot;Project_name&quot; needs to be replaced with the name of the project application and milestone number with the number of the delivered milestone. Additionally, You shall fill out all mandatory parts of the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milestone-delivery-template.md</a> as well as the invoice form linked inside the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">milestone-delivery-template.md</a>. Once You have completed the milestone delivery document, You shall create a new pull request by clicking on the &quot;create new pull request&quot; button shown inside their fork of the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository</a>.</p>
<p><strong>(iv)  Milestone review process:</strong></p>
<p>The Grants Evaluators, who are specified on the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grants-Program GitHub repository</a>, can issue comments and request changes on the milestone delivery pull request.</p>
<p>a)  Purpose and object of the milestone review process</p>
<p>The purpose of the milestone review process is to examine whether the  Milestones and/or Software meets the requirements agreed in the Specifications. The milestone review process shall take place following the submission of each milestone as specified in the time schedule.</p>
<p>The test criteria that must be met in order for the Milestones and/or Software to be considered as acceptable by Web 3.0 are determined in the Specifications.</p>
<p>The milestone review process shall be deemed to have been successfully completed if no significant defects are found in any of the Milestones and/or Development Work. Insignificant defects shall not prevent acceptance by Web 3.0.</p>
<p>b)  Acceptance Procedure</p>
<p>If any of the Milestones and/or the Software does not meet the test, review or inspection criteria, Web 3.0 shall grant You a period of 14 days to rectify the defects and any deviations from the Specifications found and objected to during the milestone review process. Rectification shall be free of charge for Web 3.0.</p>
<p>If You are unable to remedy the defects within this additional period, You shall be considered to be in default, without any additional notice by Web 3.0.</p>
<p>In the event of default, Web 3.0 may either, at its discretion:</p>
<ul>
<li>insist on the rectification of the milestones and/or the Software;</li>
<li>delegate the completion of the Software to a third party at your expenses;</li>
<li>reduce payment of the Grant because of the reduced value of the Software; or</li>
<li>refuse payment of the Grant in full (for the avoidance of doubt, this may require You to refund all milestone and advance payments made under these Terms and Conditions).</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as one evaluator approves the pull request, the delivery is officially accepted. The delivery is now a part of the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository</a>. The time point of the acceptance by the evaluator is hereby stored on GitHub. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party.</p>
<p><strong>(v)  Payment process:</strong></p>
<p>The Operations Team specified in the <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grants-Program GitHub repository</a>, gets notified once the above-specified delivery was accepted. As soon as any feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved. After this, the Operations Team makes the payment to the bank account and/or Polkadot AssetHub (for DOT, USDT and USDC) address specified in the initial application.</p>

<p>Web 3.0. shall grant You, as compensation for the delivery of the Software and the related deliverables and the grant of license rights on the Intellectual Property Rights to the Web 3.0., a Grant as indicated in the application placed in the applications folder of the W3F Grants Program Repository at <a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications</a>.</p>
<p>The Parties agree that the Grant is a lump-sum payment and that no additional compensation is due for the actual development costs incurred.</p>
<p>The Grant is paid as milestone payments for the accomplishment of the Milestones during several phases of the Development Work as indicated in the main readme file on Github (<a href="https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program</a>).</p>
<p>The Grantee accepts and acknowledges that the Grant is a combination of a lump-sum cash payment (the “Cash Grant”) and a DOT component (the “Locked DOT Grant”), together hereinafter referred to as the &quot;Grant&quot;, and that no additional compensation is due for the actual development costs incurred. We may decide the proportion of the Locked DOT Grant at our sole and absolute discretion, and the Locked DOT Grant may amount to up to 100% of the overall Grant amount. The Grant is structured as milestone payments for the accomplishment of work during several phases of the Services Delivery as indicated in Annex 1 (the &quot;Milestones&quot;).</p>
<p>The Locked DOT Grant is subject to a &quot;vested transfer&quot; mechanism, wherein the DOTs will be locked and inaccessible for disposal by the Grantee for a specific period of time. The Locked DOT Grant will be initially locked in the Grantee’s wallet and will vest proportionately over a period of twenty-four (24) months. The full amount of the Locked DOT Grant will be completely unlocked within twenty-four (24) months from the date of the DOT transfer to the Grantee’s wallet address. The Grantee acknowledges and agrees that until the full vesting period is completed, it will not be able to dispose of the entire Locked DOT Grant in any manner. The Grantee acknowledges that, despite the vesting mechanism, it assumes all ownership and risk associated with the Locked DOT Grant from the date of transfer, including compliance with any applicable tax obligations relating to the Grant. The Foundation shall not be responsible for any fluctuations in the value of the DOT during the vesting period. In the event of early termination of this Agreement, the Grantee forfeits the unvested portion of the Locked DOT Grant.</p>
<p>You shall not be entitled to an increase in compensation, even if you have had more work or greater expenses than anticipated. An increase in compensation is also excluded if extraordinary circumstances which could not have been foreseen prevent the completion of the Software or make it excessively difficult.</p>
<p>Except as specifically provided otherwise, the Grant shall be due and payable on or before thirty (30) calendar days after receiving an invoice from You and upon acceptance by the Web 3.0. of the Software and/or Milestones.</p>
<p>The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Web 3.0. shall be entitled to make Milestones payments. The Parties acknowledge and agree that any partial or advanced payments by the Web 3.0. or any third party shall be set off against the total amount of the Grant.</p>

<p>Furthermore, You shall hold Web 3.0. as well as its sublicensees harmless against any and all liability and damages for the infringement of Intellectual Property Rights of third parties, insofar as the infringement of such third party rights was caused by the intended use of the Software according to the Specifications. Web 3.0. shall immediately inform You in writing of any third party claims asserted and authorize You to conduct the defense, including the conclusion of a settlement, entirely at its own costs. In this respect, You shall use best efforts to provide Web 3.0. with the right to continue, or let continuing, using the Software or replace or modify the Software without deterioration or limitations of the functions and criteria agreed in the Specifications and without any additional costs. Should none of these measures be possible, Web 3.0. shall be entitled to withdraw from these Terms and Conditions and request the reimbursement of the Grant.</p>
<p>If You or Web 3.0. delegates the performance of an obligation or the exercise of a right under these Terms and Conditions to an associate, they are liable to the other Party for any loss or damage the associate causes intentionally or negligently in carrying out such tasks.</p>
