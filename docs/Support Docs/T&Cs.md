## 4.  Procedure

To apply for the Web 3.0 Foundation Grants Program, your application shall fulfill the following criteria:

- it shall be a research or software-based project, which contributes to the advancement of the Polkadot ecosystem;
- the Software shall be released under the Apache license version 2.0.;
- You must accept payment in USDT or USDC on Polkadot AssetHub or fiat;
- You will need to submit the application and deliver the milestones according to the process specified below;

The grants process consists of five parts, each of them described in more detail below:

**(i)  Grant application process:**

To apply for a grant of the Web 3.0  Foundation Grants Program, You shall comply with the procedures established in the README.md file under <https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program> as well as the process defined inside this document.

To apply for a grant of the Web3 Foundation Grants Program, the grantee needs to fork (= create a copy on GitHub of) the Grants-Program GitHub repository. In the newly created fork (=copy on GitHub), the grantee has to create a copy of the application-template.md. The copied application-template.md needs to be renamed as "project_name.md". "Project_name" needs to be replaced with the name of the project application. Additionally, the grantee has to fill out all mandatory parts of the application-template.md presented in bold letters. Once the grantees have completed the application, they need to create a new pull request (= in this case, a mechanism to submit the changes of the fork to the original Grants-Program GitHub repository) by clicking on the "create new pull request" button shown inside the fork of the W3F Grants-Program GitHub repository. After this, the grantee needs to sign off the terms and conditions presented via the CLA assistant.

**(ii)  Application review process:**

The Web 3.0 grants committee, which is specified on the [Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program)(the "Grants Committee"), can issue comments and request changes on the grant application pull request (the submission of the grant application on GitHub).  As soon enough members of the Grants Committee approve the pull request, the terms and conditions are signed off and all requested changes are addressed, the application is officially accepted. The application is now a part of the [W3F Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program). The time point of the acceptance by the Grants Committee is hereby stored on GitHub and counts as the official beginning of the grant. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party. The final version approved by the Grants Committee of the Specifications, the Time Schedule and Milestones will be placed  in the applications folder of the W3F Grants Program Repository at <https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications> via the merge function of GitHub.

**(iii)  Milestone delivery process:**

To submit one of the possible multiple milestones specified in the application, You shall fork the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) with the same Github account, used to submit the initial application. In the newly created fork, You shall create a copy of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). Such [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) needs to be renamed as "project_name_milestone_number.md". "Project_name" needs to be replaced with the name of the project application and milestone number with the number of the delivered milestone. Additionally, You shall fill out all mandatory parts of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) as well as the invoice form linked inside the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). Once You have completed the milestone delivery document, You shall create a new pull request by clicking on the "create new pull request" button shown inside their fork of the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery).

**(iv)  Milestone review process:**

The Grants Evaluators, who are specified on the [Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program), can issue comments and request changes on the milestone delivery pull request.

a)  Purpose and object of the milestone review process

The purpose of the milestone review process is to examine whether the  Milestones and/or Software meets the requirements agreed in the Specifications. The milestone review process shall take place following the submission of each milestone as specified in the time schedule.

The test criteria that must be met in order for the Milestones and/or Software to be considered as acceptable by Web 3.0 are determined in the Specifications.

The milestone review process shall be deemed to have been successfully completed if no significant defects are found in any of the Milestones and/or Development Work. Insignificant defects shall not prevent acceptance by Web 3.0.

b)  Acceptance Procedure

If any of the Milestones and/or the Software does not meet the test, review or inspection criteria, Web 3.0 shall grant You a period of 14 days to rectify the defects and any deviations from the Specifications found and objected to during the milestone review process. Rectification shall be free of charge for Web 3.0.

If You are unable to remedy the defects within this additional period, You shall be considered to be in default, without any additional notice by Web 3.0.

In the event of default, Web 3.0 may either, at its discretion:

- insist on the rectification of the milestones and/or the Software;
- delegate the completion of the Software to a third party at your expenses;
- reduce payment of the Grant because of the reduced value of the Software; or
- refuse payment of the Grant in full (for the avoidance of doubt, this may require You to refund all milestone and advance payments made under these Terms and Conditions).

As soon as one evaluator approves the pull request, the delivery is officially accepted. The delivery is now a part of the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery). The time point of the acceptance by the evaluator is hereby stored on GitHub. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party.

**(v)  Payment process:**

The Operations Team specified in the [Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program), gets notified once the above-specified delivery was accepted. As soon as any feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved. After this, the Operations Team makes the payment to the bank account or Polkadot AssetHub (for USDT and USDC) address specified in the initial application.

## 5.  Scope of these Terms and Conditions

The subject matter of these Terms and Conditions is (i) the development of the Software by You in accordance with the Specifications, Milestones and Time Schedule, as well as any related activities (including any development activities undertaken before the Effective Date in relation to the Software) (collectively referred to as "Development Work") in accordance with the terms of these Terms and Conditions.

In performing your obligations under these Terms and Conditions, You shall:

1. use reasonable skill and care;
2. comply with any date or time specified according to the Time Schedule;
3. perform your obligations in accordance with good industry practice, being practices in relation to the development of software and related deliverables the same as or similar to the Software that are usually followed by other suppliers in the same industry, including adherence to industry codes of practice and industry standards in relation to such products and services;
4. perform your obligations in accordance with all laws and codes of conducts applicable;
5. ensure that your development team consists of a sufficient number of appropriately skilled and experienced individuals
6. develop the Software as an open source software under the Apache license version 2.0.

Unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the Foundation, the Grantee shall not subcontract, even partially, the development of the project/deliverable to any third party.  If the project/deliverable, in whole or in part, is subcontracted to a third party without the consent of the Foundation, the Foundation is entitled to immediately terminate the Grant Agreement and to recover the grant amount already disbursed.

The Parties acknowledge and agree that the requirements set out in the Milestones may only be varied or amended by submitting another pull request and the following reevaluation by the committee under the same conditions as the initial application review process specified above.

## 6.  Obligations of User

1. You shall deliver the Software, as well as all related deliverables, including but not limited to the source code, to Web 3.0 free of defects, fully compliant with the Specifications and in accordance with the Time Schedule.

2. Web 3.0 shall be in the position to further developing, re-engineering and using the delivered Software without any technical or other limitations.

3. You shall bear all costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Development Work.

4. You shall remain positive towards the Foundation, the Foundation representatives and its goals, plans and projects. You shall advocate for the Foundation's projects' and sub-projects' aims during the term of the Agreement.

5. You shall, at all times during the term of the Agreement refrain from making, causing to be made, publishing, ratifying, endorsing, re-publishing or promulgating any and all disparaging remarks or derogatory, false, negative, critical, vilifying or otherwise detrimental statements or comments, whether implied or expressed, made in any format to any party or entity with respect to the Foundation, its officers, directors, employees, council members, advisors or otherwise affiliated individuals, entities and projects, including, but not limited to negative statements pertaining to:
    1. any management style, methods of doing business, quality of products and services, the business affairs, operation, financial condition and standing in the community; and
    2. any treatment of its officers, directors, employees, council members, advisors or otherwise affiliated individuals and any circumstances surrounding any such employment and/or separation of employment from the Foundation or advisory relationships.

### Acknowledgement and assumption of risks

You shall at all times acknowledge and agree that certain risks exist in relation to using the Polkadot network. You fully acknowledge and agree that:

- No Party, including but not limited to the Parties involved, ​owns or controls the Polkadot network. It is built by the end users themselves.
- No Party, including but not limited to the Parties involved, has any authority to approve, prevent, restrict or anyhow exercise control over any interaction that occurs through the Polkadot network. You and end users are free to build their own network and network-based applications and provide them to customers under their own terms and conditions, provided that such applications should also run and be offered in a decentralized manner (as e.g. distributed ledger technology or often referred to as "blockchain" or any future adaptations of such technologies) without central oversight.
- You shall not have any expectations over the performance, suitability for business or interoperability of the Polkadot network for Your own business purposes.
- Polkadot network source code has not passed a third party security audit and can be potentially unstable and could cause unexpected effects and system failures. You are aware of this risk and must address it within Your own privacy compliance model when establishing technical and organizational measures on data security for Your end customers.
- By using the Polkadot network You covenant, represent, and warrant that Your use of the  network complies with Your jurisdiction of residence and You are fully able and legally competent to use the Polkadot network.
- In the event Your use of the Polkadot network does not comply with the applicable law of Your jurisdiction of residence, You shall be fully liable for any consequences incurred thereof and fully acknowledge and agree that ​We ​shall not be held liable for Your use of the Polkadot network
- There is a risk that advances in cryptography or technical advances (such as the development of quantum computers) could present risks to blockchain-based applications and cryptocurrencies, Ethereum or tokens which could result in the theft or loss of such elements.
- The  network (as well as any network You build based upon it) is susceptible to mining attacks (including but not limited to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, "selfish-mining" attacks and race condition attacks. Despite the efforts of Web 3.0, the risk of known or novel mining attacks exists.
- There are risks associated with using the  network, such as e.g. failure of hardware, software and Internet connections. You acknowledge that Web 3.0 shall not be responsible for any communication failures, disruptions, errors, distortions or delays You may experience when using the  network.
