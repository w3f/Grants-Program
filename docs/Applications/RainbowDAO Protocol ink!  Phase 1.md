## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

RainbowDAO Protocol ink! is a series of smart contracts based on DAO infrastructure authorized and developed by the Rainbowcity Foundation. On the foundation of substrate development ecology, it focuses on the creation of web3 basic kits. These smart contracts are all created by the Ink! Framework. Anyone can create and manage their own DAO through RainbowDAO protocol. RainbowDAO protocol can build not only independent DAOs, but also parent DAOs, child DAOs and alliance DAOs. What's more, it can create management departments within DAOs to achieve multi-level management.

Rainbow DAO Protocol ink! has built a complete web3 basic kit technology stack revolving around the DAO ecosystem, involving 12 items and 60 independent web3 kit systems. These 12 items are DAO Organizational Management System, DAO Token Management System, DAO Personnel Management System, DAO Treasury Management System, DAO Voting and Proposal Management System, DAO Contribution Management System, DAO Financial Management System, DAO Fundraising Management System , DAO marketing management system, DAO NFT ecological management system, DAO internal DeFi management system and DAO ecological tool management system. The 12 ecosystems contain 60 independent management modules, each of them can be combined and interact with each other for different function.

Each module is developed based on the Ink! Framework, and we hope to realize the vision of a complete DAO organization Lego. It will take about 2 years to develop all the modules in DAO technology stack. We will divide the entire development plan into different phases. This grant application is the first phase of our development. We hope to realize the development of the basic module of the Rainbow DAO protocol and the creation of the DAO framework.

### Overview


DAO is more than a set of smart contracts. In essence, it is a social organization, a physical network composed of individuals with a common purpose. The code of the same smart contract, used by different groups, may demonstrate huge differences in work. Members of DAO can either abide by the established rules or change them through collective decision-making. That sparks differences among DAOs. Obviously, members in DAO is the dominator in DAO classification.

We did some research and collected the information about DAO in the encrypted world and initially divide DAO into eight major types:Protocol DAO、Investment DAO、Media DAO、Develop  DAO、NFT  DAO、Company DAO、Government DAO and Tool DAO.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainbowcitykun/Grants-Program/master/pic/1.png)


As the crypto world continues to prosper and innovate, various forms of DAO organizations that are guided by distributed ideas have emerged. These DAO organizations are exploring first-line governance methods in their own ways, and continue to carry out various forms of organizational innovation and system innovation. In order to better serve these different types of DAO organizations, DAO tools that focus on developing DAO infrastructure have emerged. It is hoped that through this  DAO tools, the operation and governance of the DAO organizations can be better realized.


This DAO tool products have an extensive application, including but not limited to the construction of DAO framework, management of voting, proposal, bounty and multi-signature wallet management. Nowadays most of them zoom in Ethereum, such as aragon and DAOstack for DAO framework, gnosis-safe for Ethereum multi-signature wallet management, Snapshot for off-chain voting, etc. 

Except for Ethereum, we are glad that tool DAO platforms showed up in DAOs of Polkadot, such as subDAO and dorafactory. They are working for a better ecosystem of Polkadot.

In the past year, with the explosive growth of various DeFi protocols and NFT protocols, various governance DAOs have achieved considerable development, accompanied by explosive growth in the demand for DAO tools. But after half a year of research, we found that although there are already many tool-based DAO projects in the encryption world, most tool-based DAO projects are still in the initial stage of industry development and there are many problems. At the same time, the entire industry of DAO also has various difficulties.

After half a year of research, we have especially summarized some of the problems existing in  DAO tool products and the current dilemmas in the DAO industry. In response to these problems and dilemmas, we have specially proposed our solution, which is the current RainbowDAO protocol.

- #### Problems in  DAO tool products
  In the last half a year, however, our team tried nearly all DAO tool products on the market. We discovered, DAO tool products are faced with the following problems:
  
  ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainbowcitykun/Grants-Program/master/pic/2.png)
  
   - #####  1. Single product function
  
    The function of most of the DAO tool products is too simple,incapable of managing sophisticated coordination. Take the product for DAO framework, for example, what it provide is merely the building of DAO, DAO voting and fund management. Besides, we see no function for department management in any DAO framework, let alone Parent DAO ,  Child DAO and Alliance DAO. The current DAO tools products are far from satisfying the needs of sophisticated coordination.

   - #####  2. Low expansibility

    Most of the current DAO tool products have poor expansibility and cannot achieve functional upgrading. DAO will develop while the tool it initially used won't, which forces the DAO give up previous experience and select a new tool. That's a common problem in DAO industry.

   - #####  3.Low compatibility

    Most of the DAO tool products are not compatible, rendering collaborative governance impossible. The reasons are, on the one hand, different DAO tools are developed by different teams with divergent concepts, it is difficult for multiple products to cooperate with each other; on the other hand, the development standards of various DAO tools are different. Without a unified api or development document, DAOs can only use one or more products in isolation according to their actual needs.

   - #####  4.Low diversity

    DAO tool products, most of them, can only meet the common requirements of DAOs, but cannot satisfy the diversified and differentiated needs yet diversification and differentiation are the characteristics of these different types of DAOs.

   - ##### 5.Low operability

    We found that most of the current DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of low operability, and users generally have poor experience in using them. Especially for some novice users, it is even more difficult to use these DAO tools.Low operability gave rise to poor experience for users. The design logic and details of these products is the key. That means development teams need take into consideration user experience.

   - ##### 6.Poor innovation

    We found that most of the current DAO tool products generally have the characteristics of poor innovation. The functional models of these products are all the same. They did not essentially solve some of the common pain points in the DAO industry. Most of them are similar. They haven't essentially conquered the difficulties in DAO industry. In the end, the products developed were not usable and reduced to a tool for capital speculation.


- #### The difficulties in DAO industry.

  After half a year of research, we found that although DAO represents the future, the current DAO field is still at a very early stage, and there are still a lot of problems and difficulties. We have now summarized some of the difficulties that currently exist in the DAO industry, mainly as follows:
  
  
  
  ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainbowcitykun/Grants-Program/master/pic/3.png)
  
   - #####  1. How to establish a reasonable organizational structure while insisting on decentralization
  
    Any healthy and promising organization requires a clear structure and reasonable division of labour, which is often sophisticated and multi-layered. The current DAO tools can only carry out some primary collaborations, and cannot handle more complex or deep-level collaborations.We always believe that a true DAO organization needs to adhere to the thought of decentralization, but also needs a clear organizational structure.

   - #####  2. How to encourage participation of community members

    A large number of token holders do not care about the community's proposals and voting results. What they are interested is the price of the token. Therefore, the participation rate of many proposals is very low, and the performance of overall community governance is poor.

   - #####  3.How to guarantee a fair voting

    A decentralized community is composed of multiple stakeholders, including whales, ordinary holders, investors and speculators. Their interest is different. In voting, in some cases, one token is one vote. And for other cases, one person is one vote. Both of the two models cannot safely protect voting fairness.RainbowDAO protocol offers different options in voting rights to refine the governance of the entire DAO system.

   - #####  4.How to quantify the contribution of community members

    At present, there are few good DAO tools to quantify the contribution of the members of the DAO. We believe this kind of tool is essential to DAO governance. We can establish generalized or differentiated bounty systems or reputation systems, credit systems, medal systems, honor systems, etc., to motivate community members to make more contribution.

   - ##### 5.How to improve efficiency and strengthen power of execution while insisting on decentralization

    DAO community is decentralized and simultaneously loose in governance. Everyone is the own of the community but everyone can refuse to work. That’s way many people don’t believe in community. We need effective management, pragmatic collaboration system and tools and proper division of labor. We need a set of web3 tools to build a division of labor system, a work reporting system to improve the work mechanism referring to the existing experience in the company system. We always believe that the essential difference between DAO and company lies mainly in the decentralization of decision-making, rather than the decentralization of jobs or functions.

   - ##### 6.How to successively conduct collective decision-making

    We always believe that the decentralization of decision-making is achieved by collective voting. But many of the members cannot decide whether they should support the proposal. One of the most important reasons is that they have no access to valid data. This requires various types of voting aids tools.

   - ##### 7.How to establish a reasonable financial system

    DAO requires the participation of all members, which cannot be achieved without fund support. DAO needs a system for community fund allocation to deal with problems like the number of departments and its working groups, the budgets of these departments, their tasks, the application for expenses and so on. Financial management policy is a crucial part in RainbowDAO protocol.

   - ##### 8.How to generate income for DAO and get income for its members

    DAO needs income to maintain high vitality and at the same time mobilize all its members to create income.In this regard, RainbowDAO protocol made some innovation. Members in some DAOs need to pay for membership. Then the service fee become the income of the DAO. Members can get a share of the fee if he managed to attract more people to join the DAO.
  
  
    To truly conquer these difficulties, we believe the most important thing is to provide these DAOs with universal and diversified DAO tools to make DAO governance systematic. That is also the mission for us to create RainbowDAO protocol today.



- #### RainbowDAO Protocol ink! solution.

    In the past two years, members of the Rainbowcity Foundation team have been conducting in-depth research on the DAO field. We hope to carry out in-depth innovation on the basis of existing products in the industry and develop tool products that truly meet the needs of the DAO market. At the same time, because the Ethereum community has the most mature DAO community, we have always focused on the Ethereum ecosystem for development, using Solidity as the development language for smart contracts.
    
    However, after research in the last six months, we found that the cost of using the Ethereum chain is constantly increasing, and the scalability of the underlying design of the Ethereum chain itself is not suitable for the large-scale development of DAO tools, so we will Focus on Polkadot ecology.

    After careful evaluation, we decided to fully embrace the Polkadot ecology initiated by Mr. Gavin Wood, adopt the substrate blockchain framework, and use the ink!  framework to develop a series of products based on the DAO infrastructure  facilities. We specially launched the RainbowDAO Protocol ink!, dedicated to solving the pain points and difficult problems in the industry, and boosting the DAO ecology towards real prosperity. 

    And at the same time, apply for grant funding from the web3 foundation in phases to obtain development funds and achieve strategic cooperation and collaboration with the web3 foundation.
    
    In RainbowDAO protocol , we put forward the concept of DCV, which is the focus of the development of all DAO tools.
    
    
    ![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainbowcitykun/Grants-Program/master/pic/6.png)
    
    
    
    DCV, DAO Controlled Value, means that the value is not controlled by any single individual or centralized entity, but by DAOs at different levels. Through the DAO governance contract, DAO can control every core parameter and decision switch in the protocol, and ultimately the holder of the governance token can decide the direction of the entire DAO through voting. 
    
    At the same time, in RainbowDAO protocol, there are different types of DAOs, including parent DAOs, child DAOs, alliance DAOs and departmental DAOs, so that more different types of participants can join in the construction of the DAO community to give full play to the power of communities.




### Project Details


In view of the current problems and difficulties in the Dao industry, in order to better meet the needs of the Dao industry and develop Web3 suite tools in line with the actual operation of Dao, Rainbowcity Foundation specially developed a series of protocols: RainbowDao Protocol ink!.

The following are the details of the : RainbowDao protocol:




![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainbowcitykun/Grants-Program/master/pic/5.png)

- #### Three major innovations of RainbowDAO protocol
  
   - #####  1. Governance Dao function
   
    In RainbowDAO protocol, we innovatively developed the function of Governance DAO, which gave wings to the expansion of the entire protocol. The governance DAO function is mainly reflected in two points:

    The first point is that the entire RainbowDAO protocol is controlled by a governance DAO. We will issue governance token RBD. The holder group of RBD is the governance group of the RainbowDAO protocol. The group of RBD holders decides the modification of the parameters of the entire RainbowDAO protocol through referendum voting, and continuously upgrades the protocol itself.

    The second point is that each independent DAO created through the RainbowDAO protocol will generate a governance DAO and bind the corresponding governance token. The governance  DAO manages the independent DAO and is responsible for the modification of the DAO parameters. Through this governance DAO finally realize the upgrade and expansion of this independent DAO.
   
    The combination of these two points makes the entire protocol no longer a fixed protocol, but an protocolt that is constantly upgraded through governance. In this way, the entire protocol can truly have vitality and growth.

   - #####  2. RainbowCore function

    We innovatively developed the RainbowCore function and used it as the authority control center of the RainbowDAO protocol. The RainbowCore module is divided into four parts, Role management, Authority management , Route management, and Rainbowcore.

    The Role management contract is responsible for managing different roles in the protocol, the Authority management contract is responsible for managing the permissions corresponding to these roles, and the Route management contract is responsible for the address management of all contracts in the entire protocol. The Rainbowcore contract is the entry management of these three contracts, overall planning and coordination.

    The four major functions of the RainbowCore module build the RainbowDAO protocol into a whole that can be flexibly matched with different roles and different permissions, and finally can achieve unlimited expansion and upgrade of the protocol.

   - #####  3. DCV controller function

    We have also innovatively developed the function of the DCV controller, which enables the entire RainbowDAO protocol to have unlimited scalability. DCV is the core function of RainbowDAO protocol. Each DAO is based on the management of DCV, and each DCV is an independent treasury system.

    We have innovatively developed the DCV controller function. Each controller is a series of existing rules written by smart contracts to complete the specified contract operations. In this way, the management of DAO has unlimited scalability. Through the DCV controller function, each DAO itself can flexibly control the assets in the DCV.

- #### Eight features of RainbowDAO protocol
   - #####  1. Modularity

    Each function of RainbowDAO protocol can exist as an independent module, which can easily trigger upgrading and evolution of the protocol. 

   - #####  2. Plug-in

    Each module of the RainbowDAO protocol is very flexible like a plug-in. 

   - #####  3.Composability

    Each module of the RainbowDAO protocol can be combined with each other. Some simple modules can work together to form a powerful module. 

   - #####  4.Scalability

    Based on the modular combination, the RainbowDAO protocol has very strong scalability and new functions can be added through the addition of modules.

   - ##### 5.Detachability

    The modules of the RainbowDAO protocol can be disassembled to achieve the simplification of DAO functional modules and adapt to actual needs. 

   - ##### 6.Interoperability

    Each module of the Rainbow DAO protocol is can interact with each other. 

   - ##### 7.Flexibility

    The RainbowDAO protocol can be combined, extended, and disassembled. This gives the RainbowDAO protocol strong scalability. The protocol can be adjusted according to the actual situation of each DAO. 

   - ##### 8.Growth

    Based on the first 7 characteristics, the RainbowDAO protocol will evolve into a living system that can upgrade infinitely with a decentralized idea.

- ####  Eight concepts of RainbowDAO protocol

  After half a year of research, we found that although DAO represents the future, the 
  
   - #####  1. Decentralization
  
    It is the soul of the RainbowDAO protocol. The protocol itself and DAOs of all levels are decentralized . 

   - #####  2. Trust-free

    RainbowDAO protocol adheres to the idea of "code is law". All rules are constructed by code with no need for intermediary. 

   - #####  3.Censorship-Resistant

    All rules of the RainbowDAO protocol are set by code to achieve complete on-chain governance, and the value of all assets is controlled by the chain. 

   - #####  4.Transparency

    The RainbowDAO protocol realizes complete on-chain governance. All data is clearly displayed on the chain.All data is transparent.

   - ##### 5.No need for permission

    The RainbowDAO protocol is composed of countless rules that have been set up in advance. They are constructed by smart contracts on the chain. Anyone can use the RainbowDAO protocol to build a DAO without permission. 

   - ##### 6.Openness

    RainbowDAO protocol is a set of open protocols and these protocols can interact with internal modules and external protocols. 

   - ##### 7.Popularity

    RainbowDAO protocol can be applied to various types of DAOs, large or small in size. 

   - ##### 8.Inclusiveness

    The RainbowDAO protocol can be employed by different types of people. We always hope to build the RainbowDAO protocol into a viable, growing, and warm protocol.

- ####  Twelve items of RainbowDAO protocol

  
    In order to better serve the entire DAO ecological infrastructure, we built a complete web3 basic suite technology stack around the entire DAO ecosystem, involving a total of 12 major items and 60 independent web3 suite systems.

    The 12 major items include 60 independent management systems, each of which is an independent module, and all modules form a complete DAO infrastructure service technology stack. Each module can be used independently, and different modules can combine with each other, which truly realizes the vision of DAO Organization Lego.

    This is our grand plan for the entire DAO infrastructure. The entire plan is too large, we will develop it in stages, and the overall development is expected to be completed in 2 years. This first grant applied for us to focus on the first item of the whole development. 
    
    
   - #####  1. DAO Organizational Management System
   
   
    Basic system of RainbowDAO protocol for the establishment and management of DAOs. It is the basis of all the other items of RainbowDAO.We can not only build the simplest DAO, but also a very large and complex DAO. Including but not limited to independent DAO, parent DAO and child DAO, as well as alliance DAO. 
   
   - #####  2. DAO Token Management System
   
    This part is mainly related to the various modules of token management. At present, various DAO infrastructures rarely have slightly complicated token management systems, which makes it impossible to realize the management and coordination of some complex tasks. In response to such pain points, in the RainbowDAO protocol, we design a variety of different forms of token management functions. Including but not limited to ERC20 Token Factory, Token Airdrop Management System, Token Locked Management System ,Token Exchange Management System, Multi-signature Wallet Management System.
   
   
   - #####  3.DAO User Management System
   
    It’s about the the member management of the entire RainbowDAO protocol. This management pattern can be employed in all independent DAOs, they can choose one or more parts of the system and they can combine these parts for their own use. Currently, there’re merely some simple functions there. We will develop more sophisticated ones based on the reality of RainbowDAO protocol. 
   
   - #####  4.DCV Management System
   
    DCV, DAO Controlled Value, is one of the core management system of RainbowDAO protocol. In the early stage, we design only relatively simple management functions of DCV. With the improvement of the protocol, we will design diversified DCV controllers for better management. 
   
   - ##### 5.DAO Voting and Proposal Management System
   
    Proposals can be divided into different types, and the corresponding processes will be different. For example, some proposals have two options, support or oppose, some proposals need to elect different candidates, and the voting result is determined by the number of votes. This requires us to consider the difference of proposal types and make different templates.
   
    Under the rules of different DAOs, some voting rights can be calculated by token, one token is one vote; some are calculated by voter, one person is one vote. These different programs can all be applied to different governance environments.
   
   
   - ##### 6.DAO Contribution Management System
   
    DAO's contribution management is mainly to guide community members to contribute to the governance of DAO through appropriate methods, and to give full play to the enthusiasm and initiative of community members. Most community members want to contribute to the community, but suffer from methods and approaches that have not contributed, and cannot get incentives through contributions. 
   
   - ##### 7.DAO Finance Management System
   
    The system is about some financial tools that may be used in DAO management, in financial procedure and policy-making to make the overall capital flow more transparent and orderly.
   
   - ##### 8.DAO Fundraising Management System
   
    Use different tools to raise funds for DAO from different channels.Only DAO has sufficient funds to support its long-term stable development. Therefore, diversified fundraising tools are a necessity for DAO operations.
   
   - ##### 9.DAO Marketing Management System
   
    With DAO as the center, various marketing platforms or competition platforms are opened to encourage users to carry out promotion and ultimately lift the popularity of DAO. 
   
   - ##### 10.DAO NFT Management System
   
    To create a set of tools for the production and circulation of various NFTs. We will take DAO as the center to build a prosperous NFT ecology on the basis of Polkadot. 
   
   - ##### 11.DAO DeFi Management System
   
    We will develop various DCV controllers to control the funds in DCV, and participate in diversified DeFi activities, which can maximize the efficiency of the use of funds in DCV and increase the rate of return of funds. 
   
  - ##### 12.DAO Ecological Tools Management System
    
    It's about various ecological tools in DAO. Instead of focusing on a specific field, it involves all aspects of the overall operation of DAO. The tools can be technical or service-oriented.

- ####  Function product display of RainbowDAO protocol

    In this chapter, we will show the product functions of the RainbowDAO protocol, especially the structure and logical relationship. We hope to let people understand the framework of RainbowDAO function through this frame diagram. 
    
    The RainbowDAO protocol is part of the DAO Basic Framework protocol. Anyone can create an independent DAO through the RainbowDAO protocol. A three-part extension  can be carried out through an independent DAO, and finally it can be upgraded infinitely. 
    
  
   - #####  1. Scale up: Alliance DAO
   
   
    An independent DAO can join a Alliance DAO. In this product structure diagram, we first virtualized several alliances. For example, we have established a project on the Polkadot main chain. Based on this project, we have established a DAO. This is an independent DAO. Our independent DAO can join the Polkadot Ecological Alliance DAO , which is an Alliance DAO. Similarly, projects on the kusama main chain can also join the Alliance DAO on the kusama main chain, and each parachain can set up an independent Alliance DAO to attract projects on the parachain to join the parachain Alliance DAO. 
   
    Similarly, whether it is the Polkadot  chain, the kusama  chain, and  each parachain, they are all built using the substrate framework. We can establish a substrate ecological Alliance DAO. The Polkadot Ecological Alliance DAO, the Kusama Ecological Alliance DAO, and the Alliance DAOS of various parachains can all join this substrate Ecological Alliance DAO, Ultimately realize the sharing of resources.

    This example is the Alliance DAO established from the perspective of development technology. According to the differences in DAO attributes and types, we can also establish investment Alliance DAO, media Alliance DAO, social Alliance DAO, and so on. Similarly, we can also establish Alliance DAOs in different regions through regional differences. The European Alliance DAO, the Asian Alliance DAO, the American Alliance DAO, and so on. 

    In Alliance DAO management, an independent DAO can freely choose to join an Alliance DAO or leave an Alliance DAO without the permission of the Alliance DAO. There are no rigid management and ownership requirements between each other. 
   
   - #####  2. Scale Out: Parent DAO and Child DAO
   

    Each independent DAO can establish its own Child DAO. In fact, this is equivalent to the relationship between the parent company and the subsidiary. Each Child DAO belongs to an independent DAO in terms of attribution, and is exactly the same as an independent DAO in terms of functional modules. The Parent DAO has the right to manage the Child DAO.Unless the  Parent DAO agrees to the independence of the Child DAO through a referendum, the Child DAO cannot exist independently.

    Child DAO is created by the Parent DAO, the Parent DAO has the authority to control the Child DAO, the Child DAO of the Child DAO can also be managed by the Parent DAO, and so on. Child DAO has management authority to directly belong to Child DAO, and cannot be cross-level management. Example: Parent DAO A creates Child DAO B, Child DAO B creates Child DAO C, and Child DAO C creates Child DAO D. The Parent DAO A has the management authority of B, C, D, and Child DAO B has the management authority of Child DAO C. But Child DAO B does not have administrative rights to Child DAO D. The Parent DAO can perform cross-level management of Child DAOs, but cross-level management between Child DAOs is not possible. 

   - #####  3.Scale In: DAO department management

    Each independent DAO can establish a department belonging to this independent DAO, which means that this independent DAO can establish its own clear organizational structure. This is also the core function of the RainbowDAO protocol that we have always emphasized. We have always believed that any DAO cannot have only one department, but should have multiple departments working together. 

    In the RainbowDAO protocol, each department established by an independent DAO is also equivalent to an independent small DAO, with various basic functions of the DAO. But it is not an independent DAO in nature, but a sub-department within an independent DAO. In our overall product planning, the management authority of these sub-departments is more in the form of multisig smart contracts, and a multisig committee is responsible for managing this department, rather than through voting for all DAO members. This is the decentralization mechanism of DAO management, which decentralizes the overall power to the department for processing. 

    In the same way, a department can continue to set up departments to further decentralize and distribute power. Establish collaborative work with complex tasks through the department's layers. This is the most basic function we think a large DAO must have. 

    In the same way, a department can continue to set up departments to further decentralize and distribute power. Establish collaborative work with complex tasks through the department's layers. This is the most basic function we think a large DAO must have.

    We also give examples in the framework diagram to facilitate everyone to understand our product logic. First of all, we established an independent DAO. In the department management of this independent DAO, we established five independent departments. They are the Human Resources Management Committee DAO, the Financial Management Committee DAO, the Technology Management Committee DAO, the Operation Management Committee DAO, and the Investment Management Committee DAO. These five departments are responsible for the specific operations of this independent DAO. 

    At the same time, these five independent departments are divided into different groups under each department, and continue to refine the division of labor. For example, the Human Resources Committee DAO is divided into two groups: the organizational structure management group and the salary management group; the Financial Management Committee DAO is divided into the budget management group and the fund use management group; the Technology Management Committee DAO is divided into the technology development management group and Grant supports these two groups; the operation management committee is divided into the brand management group and the event promotion management group under the DAO; the investment management committee is divided into the project review management group and the foreign investment management group and so on. 

    Most of these management groups also exist in the form of a multisig management committee. This is also a function of DAO's decentralization to the following independent departments. Complex coordination must be achieved through refined division of labor, which is the same nature as the operation of a company. Only with clear division of labor and clear responsibilities can it be possible to improve efficiency and execution.

- ####  Design mechanism of RainbowDao protocol

    Through the above series of information, we have learned about the grand plan of RainbowDAO protocol, which is a huge project that allows DAO to expand infinitely and upgrade infinitely. So how is the RainbowDAO protocol constructed as a whole? What is the structure of the protocol itself? In this part, we focus on sharing with you the architecture design of the RainbowDAO protocol itself, so that everyone can clearly know the implementation method of the RainbowDAO protocol. 
    
    We can understand the design architecture of the RainbowDAO protocol from three parts. 
  
   - #####  1.Tier 1 Architecture: RBD Governance Dao
   
    The first layer of the RainbowDAO protocol consists of RBD governance DAO. RBD belongs to the governance token of the RainbowDAO protocol. The holders of RBD constitute the DAO and are responsible for the governance and management of the entire RainbowDAO protocol. RBD governance DAO coordinates all the parameters and conditions of the RainbowDAO protocol. The holders of RBD voted to determine the modification and optimization of each parameter of the RainbowDAO protocol, and realize the expansion and upgrade of the RainbowDAO protocol. The RBD governance DAO belongs to the overall control center of the RainbowDAO protocol, and all management powers belong to the owners of all RBD governance tokens.
   
   - #####  2.Tier 2 Architecture: Basic Protocol Layer
   
    The second layer of the RainbowDAO protocol is the basic part of the protocol, not the part of the DAO created by the protocol. Basic Protocol Layer mainly contains six parts, one is the rainbow core contract, the second is the membership management contract, the third is the revenue management contract, the fourth is the web3 suite tool contract, the fifth is the DCV controller contract, and the sixth is the DAO factory contract. The DAO factory contract also belongs to the third layer of the RainbowDAO protocol, which is mainly used to control and manage the DAO created by the protocol. 

    Rainbow core contract consists of four parts, role management contract ,authority management contract,  routing management contract and rainbowcore management contract  . This is the permission control center of the RainbowDAO protocol, which manages the permissions and roles of the entire protocol, and is responsible for the upgrade of the RainbowDAO protocol. 

    The membership management contract is responsible for managing the members of the protocol as a whole. One is to manage the identity information of the members, and the other is to manage the recommendation relationship of the members. The recommendation system and membership management modules are developed from this. 

    The revenue management contract belongs to the revenue management control center of the RainbowDAO protocol. RainbowDAO protocol itself will set a series of income categories, such as calling the contract requires payment of DOT as a contract usage fee, DCV will charge a certain percentage of the treasury usage fee and so on. In this way, the RainbowDAO protocol can generate revenue in a variety of ways. The more people who use the protocol, the more income they can get. The final income will also be proportionally returned to the holders of RBD governance.

    Tool contracts related to Web3 belong to the management center of tool contracts. For example, ERC20 token manufacturing factory contract, multisig wallet management contract, token airdrop contract, token lock-up contract and so on. In the future, all tool contracts can be placed under this large module. 

    The DCV controller contract belongs to the controller management center of the Rainbow DAO protocol. Various controllers can be made here, especially when it comes to DeFi management. 
   
   - #####  3.Tier 3 Architecture:DAO Factory
   
    The above contract parts belong to the overall level of the RainbowDAO protocol. The third layer belongs to the DAO Factory contract, which is mainly used for the batch creation and management of DAO. 

    The DAO Factory contract can be divided into three parts . 

    The first part belongs to the DAO type contract. The DAO type is divided into three types: independent DAO, Alliance DAO, and Child DAO, which directly determines the most basic nature of the established DAO. 

    The second part belongs to the DAO initialization contract, which is used for DAO creation and initialization information. 

    The third part belongs to the DAO management contract, which belongs to the basic management of the contract after the establishment of the DAO.

    The DAO management contract is mainly divided into 7 modules. 

    The first module is the DAO basic setting contract, which is mainly responsible for the setting of DAO basic information; 

    The second module is the DAO authority management contract, which is mainly responsible for the authority, role management in this DAO and the termination and liquidation of DAO; 

    The third module is mainly the DAO member management contract, which is responsible for the member management of this DAO, including the entry threshold and the deletion of members, etc.;

    The fourth module is the DAO treasury management contract, which is mainly responsible for DAO's treasury management ;

    The fifth module is the DAO voting management contract, which is mainly responsible for a series of voting rights related settings;

    The sixth module is the DAO proposal management contract, which is mainly responsible for DAO proposal management; 

    The seventh module is the DAO department management contract, which is mainly responsible for department management of DAO. 
   
    
   
  These three parts constitute the basic framework of the RainbowDAO protocol. In the future, the RainbowDAO protocol will be continuously upgraded and expanded on the basis of these basic frameworks, and will become the infrastructure of the DAO industry. 
  
  

### Ecosystem Fit

Help us locate your project in the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama landscape and what problems it tries to solve by answering each of these questions:


![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rainbowcitykun/Grants-Program/master/pic/11.png)

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?

    First of all, the Rainbowcity Foundation chose the Polkadot ecology of Dr. Gavin Wood. From a long-term perspective, we have a total of three levels of planning to integrate into the Polkadot ecosystem through three steps. 
    

   - In the first step, we will develop a series of smart contracts that belong to the DAO infrastructure based on the ink! framework. This is RainbowDAO Protocol ink!. All protocols exist in the form of smart contracts, so that they can be widely deployed on any Parachains and independent public chains developed based on Polkadot, Substrate and Kusama networks. 

   - In the second step, we will develop based on the parachains of Polkadot and Kusama, transform some of the smart contracts involving the underlying architecture into the form of a pallet, and we will create a parachain that belongs to the DAO infrastructure. Part of the DAO infrastructure exists in the form of pallets, and part of the DAO infrastructure exists in the form of ink! smart contracts. Pallet involves the creation of DAO facilities at the lower level of the parachain, while smart contracts tend to create DAO tool types with greater flexibility. In this way, we will build a parachain based on the DAO infrastructure and rely on this parachain to build an ecosystem. The project parties deployed on this parachain all use RainbowDAO Protocol ink! for project governance, building a fully community-driven, decentralized governance parachain.

   - The third step is that in the next 3 to 5 years, with the stable development of Rainbow DAO's smart contracts and parachains, we will start to build an independent public chain of Rainbowcity based on the substrate framework with an independent consensus mechanism. The ecosystem will be further built on the basis of the independent public chain of Rainbowcity. The focus of the ecosystem is on the token economy and community governance, with DAO governance as its soul. We will migrate a series of physical industries to the Rainbowcity independent public chain, which is a further extension and expansion of the substrate ecosystem.

- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?

   - First, for ourselves, we will initiate our independent project RainbowDAO based on RainbowDAO Protocol ink! in good time, committed to the creation of DAO infrastructure, and truly serve the Polkadot DAO ecosystem.

   - Second, any project party who wants to create a project based on Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama. Because our protocol  exists in the form of a smart contract, allowing anyone to use it. Therefore, any project party can refer to, modify or directly deploy our code to provide DAO infrastructure for the entire Polkadot ecosystem. We treat all participants with a completely open attitude.

   - Third, any parachain builder can directly adopt our code and deploy it on their parachain to provide DAO infrastructure for the project parties on their parachain.

   - Fourth, when RainbowDAO Protocol ink! is deployed on a large scale in the Polkadot ecosystem in different ways, any type of DAO can use our protocol to create their DAO, and help them operate and manage their own DAO to the greatest extent.  

- What need(s) does your project meet?


Provide DAO infrastructure and web3 tool suite for various types of DAO. 

- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?


We found that there are already DAO infrastructure-based projects in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as subDAO and dorafactory. At the same time, there are also a large number of related projects in the Ethereum ecosystem, such as aragon and DAOstack focusing on the DAO framework, gnosis-safe focusing on the management of  multi-signature wallets, and snapshot platform Snapshot focusing on off-chain voting. Compared with these existing projects, RainbowDAO Protocol ink! can handle more complex DAO governance and collaboration. Our protocol  itself is more extensible, more flexible, more vital, creative and innovative. For specific details, please refer to the three innovations, eight features, and eight concepts of the RainbowDAO protocol described in the text above. These are our core competitiveness, and are also the basis for the continuous development and evolution of our products.

### Team's experience

We have a full-time team of more than 20 people, including 11 full-time development teams, mainly Ethereum ecological development. Since 2019, under the leadership of RainbowKun, our team has prepared the Rainbowcity project entirely with our own funds. Rainbowcity is committed to building a digital city-state based on token economy and community governance. The core idea of Rainbowcity is DAO. We hope to build Rainbowcity into a trillion-dollar super-economy through 10 years of development, and create a virtual city-state based on the blockchain, and create a free state that adheres to the spirit of bitcoin, and to create a new civilization for mankind.

Rainbowcity is a DAO, and the design of the entire project is centered on DAO. In 2020 and 2021, the main work of our team is to design the Rainbowcity  project and develop Rainbowcity DAO. In the past, we focused on the Ethereum market and built the entire ecosystem of Rainbowcity on the Ethereum main chain and L2 network in the form of smart contracts. Therefore, our team mainly develops RainbowcityDAO smart contracts based on solidity.

In the past year, we have developed a complete product of RainbowcityDAO in solidity language. The entire product has more than 100 smart contracts, including more than 60 core contracts, more than 20 coordinator contracts for contract deployment, and more than 30 interface contracts. The development workload is one of the largest projects in the Ethereum ecosystem.

However, when we fully developed the RainbowcityDAO contract, after a comprehensive evaluation by our team, the Ethereum ecosystem could not support the operation of the entire Rainbowcity project. On the one hand, the cost of using the Ethereum main chain is getting higher and higher, on the other hand, the overall performance and future scalability of the Ethereum main chain cannot support the operation of the Rainbowcity project.

At this time, we are faced with multiple choices in the future development direction. One is to continue to stick to the Ethereum ecosystem, wait for the maturity of the Ethereum L2 network, and build the Rainbowcity ecosystem on the basis of the L2 network. The second is to build a completely independent public chain by ourself, and build the Rainbowcity ecology in the form of our own public chain. The third is to choose other emerging public chains in the market.

After various investigations, we chose the Polkadot ecosystem created by Dr. Gavin Wood to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems. We pay particular attention to the ideas and concepts of the Parity team and the web3 foundation team led by Dr. GavinWood to see if these concepts are decentralized. As we learn more about Dr. GavinWood, we find that Substrate and Polkadot are our best choices.

Therefore, in June 2021, we made the biggest decision of our team in the past three years to suspend our development and research in the Ethereum ecosystem and join the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem created by Dr. Gavin Wood. Our developers have also begun to switch development languages, starting from the original solidity to Rust and ink!. This is the most important decision our team has made in the past three years. Abandoning the familiar technology and learning new development technology is also a major challenge for our development team. However, we are not afraid of this challenge, and actively embrace this challenge. We firmly believe that Substrate and Polkadot belong to the future of blockchain.

At the same time, inspired by the relationship between Substrate and Polkadot, we have also adjusted the product structure. The original Rainbowcity was an independent project, an independent DAO, and our development was also based on this DAO. All our development needs are the needs of the project itself, and these DAO tools cannot meet the general needs of other DAOs. Inspired by the relationship between Substrate and Polkadot, we decided to abstract the product that was originally only applicable to RainbowcityDAO and make it applicable to various DAOs. This is why we launched RainbowDAO Protocol ink! today. Our team has been conducting research internally for the past six months, and now we have a preliminary and complete system. 

In order to quickly integrate into the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem, we decided to participate in the grant application of the web3 foundation to start our Polkadot journey. Through the grant application of the web3 foundation, participants in the entire Polkadot ecosystem can have a more systematic understanding of our development philosophy and future vision. We hope to use the grant platform as our first step to integrate into the Polkadot ecosystem, show our strength and our grand vision step by step, and become a part of the Polkadot ecosystem. 

At the same time, in the past two years, due to the need for project confidentiality, our development team has not released any project information. The github accounts of all our members are also newly registered, so there is not much history. In order to let the web3 foundation grant team have a simple understanding of our development capabilities, we uploaded the previously developed RainbowcityDAO project source code to github.

It is our regret that these codes were abandoned without formal use. We will start the creation on Polkadot from scratch. Of course, we will not completely abandon the development on Ethereum. In the future, we will also develop the solidity version of the RainbowDAO protocol simultaneously.

## Development Status :open_book:

Our leader RainbowKun is a believer in Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin. He has been thinking about the philosophy of Bitcoin for the past four years. Since July 1, 2021, he spent 3 months writing more than 50 original articles on Bitcoin thoughts, and published them on the Bitcointalk forum created by Satoshi Nakamoto, sparking a series of extensive discussions. This is also the underlying idea that we initiated the creation of the Rainbowcity project and the RainbowDAO protocol. Now we choose a few links for everyone to read, so that everyone can better understand the thoughts of Rainbowcity:

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

The entire RainbowDAO Protocol ink! is a huge project, involving 12 large modules and 60 small modules. It is estimated that it will take one to two years to complete the development. We decompose some core modules into 3 to 5 different phases, develop step by step, and apply for grant support from the web3 foundation.

In the first phase of our overall development, we mainly completed the basic framework part of the RainbowDAO protocol. The first part is the protocol layer of the RainbowDAO protocol itself, and the second part is the RainbowDAO factory contract, which is used for the construction of the DAO Factory. Both parts are basic functions, and the extended function part is not involved for the time being. When our first phase is completed and the RainbowDAO protocol can operate normally, we will develop various extension modules.

### Overview

- **Total Estimated Duration:**  8 weeks
- **Full-Time Equivalent (FTE):** 8
- **Total Costs:** 48000 USD

### Milestone 1 

- **Estimated duration:** 3 weeks
- **FTE:**  8
- **Costs:** 20,000 USD

For the first milestone, we focused on developing some basic contracts of RainbowDAO Protocol ink!, that is, the underlying structure of the entire protocol. Including governance DAO contract, ERC20 factory contract, multisig management system contract, user management system contract, income category management contract, role management contract, authority management contract, routing management contract, rainbowcore management contract, etc., a total of 9 systems.The name, function or quantity of the final developed contract may be different from the estimate in this table. At that time, the actual developed code shall prevail.
