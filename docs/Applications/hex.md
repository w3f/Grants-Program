## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Hex  Space Social Graph is  heavily inspired by Five Degrees protocol implementation [5degrees](https://github.com/5DegreesProtocol/5degrees-protocol.git)
Five Degrees propose a simple entity data ownership protocol and use the protocol to capitalize these core data. To make the protocol simple enough, permission-less, and composable, we choose to build the protocol under the existing ERC-1155 standard. Compatible with the ERC-1155 standard, meaning it will be easily implanted into any protocol or business of Web3 that supports ERC-1155. The NFT generated in the protocol can be traded in any NFT market, also any smart contract that requires user relationships can track this data on chain. Any application that supports ERC-1155, can easily integrate this protocol.


### Project Details

With the development of the Web3.0 industry, entities build a relationship network by minting target NFTs, thereby forming a huge transparent, unified, and permission-less relationship network
infrastructure. All DAPPs focus on their own business, and combine the relationship network to realize various products. For example, a social module can be added to Uniswap, so that users can easily know the detailed data of the transactions of the people they follow, or a moment feature can be added to OpenSea, so that users can easily know what kinds of NFTs are their friends trading or holding, just like integrating Twitter or Discord into OpenSea, or if a social network product uses this solution to start its business, the user's friend relationship can be reconnected in Sandbox even the product failed.
Core methods:
Set Entity's Info:Invoke setInfo to set entity's information
Get Entity's Info:Invoke contract's URI methods to get current entity's information Set entity's followers limitation:invoke increaseMaxSupply method
Build the relationship between entities:Invoke mint method to mint an NFT of the following, hold his NFT means your relationship is connected
Destroy the relationship between entities:Invoke burn method to destroy a following's NFT to disconnect the relationship
Get entity's follower list:Query through check the who is holding the entity's NFT Get entity's following list:Query through check the whose NFT is the entity holding.
