## Project Overview :page_facing_up:


### Overview

* Tag line: An infrastructure for a blockchain-based decentralized cloud data network.
* Brief description: Cumulus Encrypted Storage System (CESS) is dedicated to develop a new global decentralized cloud data storage platform – a blockchain-based network infrastructure that is transparent, efficient, and equal opportunity to all members of the global community. CESS encourages excess or under-utilized resources as nodes to join CESS’s unrestricted expandable network via the token economy incentive method. Each node joins the CESS peer-to-peer network by contributing data storage resources, computational resources, or network bandwidth. Built on our state-of-the-art virtualization and cloud computing technologies, CESS organizes and manages the participating resources providing clients with secure, high performance, and boundless cloud data storage services. Furthermore, the CESS protocol enables interconnection of network nodes, to build a large decentralized cloud storage system that supports up to 100PB storage scale to meet the demand of enterprise level data storage. CESS will adopt a phased approach to implement the above goals.
* Indication 1: With the goal of entering Polkadot ecosystem, CESS will build a blockchain system based on Substrate directly, and plans to develop custom pallets on FRAME. In the future, CESS will consider integrating to Polkadot in the form of Parachain to create a new decentralized cloud storage ecosystem, establish a large-scale distributed storage network.
* Indication 2: With rapid advances of new computing technologies such as big data and machine learning, the value of humanity’s digital assets, the so-called “Digital Gold”, are being discovered. Explosively growing amount of data in cyberspace calls for new technologies of secure data storage and efficient data sharing. The challenges are to achieve secure storage, efficient sharing, and trading with data owner’s rights protection, but current solutions are complex and worrisome. Distributed storage networks can better drive the arrival of Web3.0 and are one of the underlying technical infrastructure of Web3.0.

Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture, etc. to be deployed

* CESS is a high-speed, secure, scalable and decentralized cloud storage system. It can handle tens of thousands of transactions per second through parallel technology. Through Data slicing technology, it can achieve the secure storage of massive data, and it has the functions of Data confirmation and Data rights protection, which provides powerful data service ability. It provides DAPP with unlimited scalable storage capacity and perfect Data rights protection capability.

* Data storage workflow: When a client requests to store a data file, the CESS platform pre-processes the data file to obtain and store its meta-data and data fingerprints. The pre-process software also performs data file replication and fault tolerant erasure coding. The meta-data includes info of data owner, data keywords, and etc. The data fingerprints are for subsequent data rights confirmation.

* CESS client-platform interactions: A typical CESS data client and platform interaction flow is as follows: first, a data storage client interrogates CESS chain to get current storage price. The client then places an order for his/her data file via extrinsics on blockchain. Once the payment is made and order is approved, the client then uploads the data file using API provided by CESS platform. The data file is not directly uploaded to storage nodes, instead it is uploaded to a CESS storage scheduling node. The scheduling nodes are the ones with secure hardware environment (Trusted Execution Environment or TEE) and the data file will be pre-processed, encrypted, and sharded. Finally, the scheduling node distributes data segments to storage nodes to store. CESS storage miners do not make deal directly with clients, and they get rewarded from CESS system by providing storage space. Miners’ storage resources are uniformly managed by CESS system, which fairly distributes data files. Miners have the responsibility to maintain the integrity of clients’ data. Any malicious behavior will be punished (CESS token deduction).

* Overall system architecture: CESS adopts a layered and loosely coupled system architecture, which is divided into blockchain service layer, distributed storage resource layer, distributed content delivery layer and application layer.
<div align=center><img width="68%" height="68%" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cumulus2021/W3F-illustration/main/img7.png"/></div>

* CESS MDRC mechanism workflow: CESS have designed a unique **Multi-format Data Rights Confirmation Mechanism (MDRC)**, which extracts data fingerprint from each data file to generate data certificate ID. By comparing similarities between data fingerprints, the system identifies data lineages of data files, and may take appropriate actions to prevent possible violations, and to provide strong evidences for owners’ data rights protection.

### Ecosystem Fit

CESS is a distributed cloud data network with user friendly ledgers, novel consensus mechanism, multiple data authenticity proof schemes, and reliable network infrastructure. CESS offers data storage service with the advantages of low cost, privacy protection, security and robustness. With the implementation of CESS data confirmation and proxy re-encryption technology, CESS provides Web3.0 clients and DAPPs with trustworthy, secure and reliable data rights protection.

Compared to the similar projects in the Polkadot ecosystem including Ocean, DataHighway and Bluzelle, CESS storage service features:
* Encrypted data storage
* Multiple copies (3 copies by default, more upon request)
* Sharded and distributed on multiple nodes
* Highly scalable storage space
* Transactions secured by CESS blockchain
* Data rights protection for data owners
* Competitive cost
