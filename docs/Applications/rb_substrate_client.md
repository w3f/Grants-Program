# W3F Open Grant Proposal

* **Project Name:** Ruby Substate Client
* **Team Name:** UNI-ARTS
* **Payment Address:** 0xE7188c7e225D473eE9D99108482Af54952d71527 (USDT)
* **Status:** [Terminated](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/613#issuecomment-1122685293)

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Ruby Substate Client will support a efficient way to interface with substrate chain with ruby.

This library will provide convenience methods to deal with SR25519, ED25519 sign and verify message. 

Encode/Decode the chain message, submit the sign message to chain by rpc.

Through this grant, we hope to 

1. SR25519, ED25519 support.

2. Submit sign extrinsics to chain.

### Project Details

1. Develop SR25519 gem.

2. Develop rpc gems inlcude submit extrinsics and batch submit extrinsics.

#### Apis

- SR25519.keypair_from_seed(seed)
- SR25519.sign(message, keypair)
- SR25519.verify(address, message, signature_result)
- ED25519.keypair_from_seed(seed)
- ED25519.sign(message, keypair)
- Ed25519.verify(address, message, signature_result)
- RbSubstrateClient.submit_sign_extrinsics(params, keypair)
- RbSubstrateClient.utility_batch_submit(params, keypair)

#### Technology stack

- [ruby lang](https://www.ruby-lang.org/) 2.7
- [ruby on rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) 6.1, web framework

### Team Code Repos

* https://github.com/uni-arts-chain/sr25519
* https://github.com/uni-arts-chain/rb_substrate_client

## Development Status :open_book:

Much of the technology is already implemented [app.uniarts.network](https://app.uniarts.network/). But now the code is in the project, not written as a library. and it needs more tests. We expect that we can refactor, reuse and generalize existing code. write gems to help other ruby developers.
