# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project:** polkadot-java-client
* **Proposer:** splix
* **Payment Address:**  bc1qce0nvef6txyahe9xvrdjavvw7qemzvhyp4ux55

## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

We propose the creation of a Java client library to access Polkadot based networks. 
Witch is the main target of JVM based server-side applications. 
Java, and JVM in general, are the de-facto standard platform used by an enterprise or large-scale internet services. 
It's critical to have a JVM based client library to get adoption by enterprises. 

We have extensive experience with booth blockchain, including Polkadot, and Java technologies. 
As an example, we previously created a Java library for Ethereum called Etherjar https://github.com/emeraldpay/etherjar, and a have some implementation of Polkadot protocol in JVM with the project Moonbeam https://github.com/emeraldpay/moonbeam. 
We want to continue our work and create a JVM library targeting the Polkadot.

Please note that a full-featured client library is usually being involved during the whole lifetime of the target system (i.e., Polkadot).
Therefore, as a result of the current project, we expect to build only an initial implementation, which should meet most of the current critical needs by a Java developer.
But over the following months, maybe even years, the library is going to be developed with advanced features.

The main target is server-side Java 11, which is the current LTS release (2018-2023) of Java. 
But in addition, we want to leave a possibility to support older versions and/or Android.

The library is going to be released under the Apache 2 license. 
Build artifacts are going to be published to a publicly accessible Maven repository, with Javadoc and documentation in the Github repo and/or on the company website.
