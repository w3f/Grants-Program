## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

Fennel Labs and Whiteflag Foundation aim to improve the ways that organizations communicate with each other in calamitous situations and austere environments where coordination and deconfliction is vital.

This grant proposal describes the first step of a long-term plan to develop Fennel Protocol, a Substrate chain that will provide the Polkadot ecosystem with the Whiteflag Protocol specification, an open standard for a neutral and trusted messaging network based on blockchain technology.

The background of the Whiteflag specification is as follows:

> Current armed conflicts are highly complex, because of the sheer number of parties involved: regular military forces, armed groups, peacekeeping forces, neutral parties such as journalists and non-governmental human-rights and aid organisations, civilians, refugees etc. Even though parties are opposing forces, or neutral organisations that do not want to show any affiliation, they do require to quickly and directly communicate to one or more other parties involved in the conflict in different situations. 
> <br/> <br/> This is not new. The white flag is the original internationally recognized protective sign of truce or ceasefire, and request for negotiation. A white flag signifies to all that an approaching negotiator is unarmed, with an intent to surrender or a desire to communicate. 
> <br> <br> This standard for a digital white flag protocol, the Whiteflag Protocol, provides a reliable means for both combatant and neutral parties in conflict zones to digitally communicate pre-defined signs and signals using blockchain technology. These sign and signals can also be used to communicate information about natural and man-made disasters, thus creating shared situational awareness beyond conflicts. 
> <br/> <br/>  All in all, the protocol forms the basis for a neutral and open network, the Whiteflag Network, for trusted real-time messaging between parties in conflicts and disaster response.

### Project Details

Fennel Protocol will be a blockchain implementing the protocol outlined in our specification documents.
As such, the interface will be exposed through Substrate extrinsics, callable through normal RPC execution.
The protocol implementation itself will ship as a standard Substrate executable node.
Docker will be used to generate consistent testing environments, and Github Actions will provide continuous revision checking against a set of tests defined during the development process.

The Protocol will consist of 3 Runtime Modules - `fennel_trust_pallet`, `fennel_keystore_pallet`, and `fennel-signal`.
Documentation for the in-progress development of these modules is located on [GitHub](https://fennellabs.com/Fennel-Protocol/doc/fennel_protocol_runtime/index.html) and is refreshed as changes are accepted into the `main` branch of the source repository.
The high-level project specification is located on [Github](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fennelLabs/Fennel-Protocol-Paper/master/Paper.pdf) as well and is available as a PDF.

A proof-of-concept for the basic functionality of Fennel Protocol was completed as the winning entry to the Conflict Prevention track of the Odyssey Momentum Hackathon in 2020, under the name Theriak.
The repository for that project is located on [GitHub](https://github.com/fennelLabs/Theriak).
The features for this proof-of-concept included key management, basic trust operations, and a simple, preliminary version of the signaling mechanism.

Fennel Protocol is not a user-facing application.
Though applications are planned, they are beyond scope for this proposal.

### Ecosystem Fit
Fennel Protocol's key and identity management functionality is fine-tuned for decentralized communication that makes use of pre-defined signals and signs;
for example, the Whiteflag specification uses predefined signals and signs derived from International Humanitarian Law, the CRED Disaster Category Classification, and the OECD Economic Infrastructure Common Reporting Standard Codes.
Future proposals will build up Fennel Protocol to accomodate the full extent of the Whiteflag Protocol specification.
Substrate's interoperability will provide the Polkadot ecosystem with a shared conception of Whiteflag Protocol's predefined signals and signs;
this will allow users to seemlessly send Whiteflag messages across the decentralized Polkadot ecosystem. Critically, an interoperable Whiteflag Network ensures situational awareness is not siloed but is unified in critical use cases. This helps decision makers receive a full picture of the field of operations. 

#### Whiteflag Section 2.5: Minimally Viable Implementation:
Fennel Protocol will implement the minimally viable implementation of the Whiteflag functionality that allows for the sending of Whiteflag messages. 
We will implement further components of Whiteflag in further proposals. Whiteflag section 2.5 states: any implementation of the Whiteflag Protocol that sends messages on the Whiteflag Network, must implement at a minimum the following functionality:

* The Whiteflag Authentication message with at least one authentication option. At release, both Shared Secret and External Resource Authentication will be fully supported.

* The possibility to Recall, Update and Discontinue (Whiteflag Reference Codes 1, 2 and 4) any implemented sign or signal, if such Reference Type is valid i.a.w. Reference options. These will be implemented as low-level Fennel messages through the Sign extrinsic call, effectively creating a specialized transaction subtype for each of these.

Fennel Protocol will provide the Substrate infrastructure for two authentication methodologies that abide by Whiteflag Protocol’s specification.

* Method 1, External Resource Authentication: requires the user to declare their identity in some public and trusted place which can be referenced in their activities. This often requires a strong proof, such as a cryptographic signature and public key declaration, that can be verified to prove that a transaction comes from the identity declared.

* Method 2, Shared Secret Authentication:  requires an end user to establish a token known only to themselves and some authentication authority, similar to a password in more Web 2.0-oriented authentication.

Fennel Protocol will support both of these authentication mechanisms at launch, with shared secrets covered by our encrypted channel mechanism and external resources declared and submitted as public transactions through the Identity Update extrinsic.

In terms of a target audience, we have a small established userbase waiting for this protocol to be prepared for launch.
This proposal will set the stage for a greater effort to empower developers to build decentralized applications that allow users to transmit authentic, secure, and timely real-time messages based on pre-defined signals and signs.
Most importantly, we hope this effort will support decision makers working in critical environments in need of such communication, such as first responders, medical professionals, pharmacovigilance scientists, and investigative journalists.

## Development Status :open_book:

The Fennel Protocol source respository is located at https://github.com/fennelLabs/Fennel-Protocol.
Included is the runtime structure for a Substrate node and references to the three main submodules that will implement Fennel Protocol's core functionalities.
The most recent version of this is an updated version of the Theriak project's core functionality, ported to the most recent version of Substrate at the time of writing.
Any blockchain components will be implemented in Rust, with the initial implementations of chain-parallel components written in Python.

The initial Whiteflag implementation will cover AES 256 encryption as outlined in the Whiteflag specification.
Fennel Protocol will also include support for RSA with a minimal key size of 4096 bits.

## Future Plans

Fennel Protocol is intended to be a continuously-developing project.
The basic architecture was designed with extensibility in mind;
identity and signaling applications should be able to easily build on the runtime with expanding available features and continued support for existing features.


## Additional Information :heavy_plus_sign:

**How did you hear about the Grants Program?** 
We heard about the Grants Program from the Web 3 Foundation Website, as well as personal recommendations from Polkadot community members. 

Thus far, we've ported our Theriak repository to the most recent version of Substrate as of writing of this application.
Financial contribution has not yet begun for the Fennel Protocol project.
We've also begun writing function and trait stubs to ensure that thorough documentation can be generated.
