# Open Grant Proposal

* **Project:** Bit.Country by MVP.STUDIO
* **Proposer:** https://github.com/bit-country
* **Payment Address:** 12uaicGQziqP41nmpdWTMkorWijN3eAq8J

## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 


**Background**

MVP.STUDIO (New Zealand) is a talent & tech startup incubator, it manages a tech community with 1,500 members and has launched software products with a customer base across 8 countries. In recent years, the core team had started exploring blockchain technologies and created blockchain related education programmes and projects.

**Bit.Country Is**

Bit.Country provides a new way to socialize with a game feel, while also being driven by real economics.

* A decentralized world - putting community first. 
* An open NFT/game protocol for managing & incentivizing small-medium communities using gamification.

**Mission Statement**

Bit.country provides a platform that attracts classic internet users to experience the power of the decentralized web in the communities that they have involvement.

**The Goal**

After the 3-months plan, our final goal is to have a complete MVP solution (Both the app and chain) and onboard the rest of our network members (~1400 users remaining). Then, we will run our marketing campaign to onboard more users outside of our network, we are planning to onboard 50k users by Aug 2021.

**A Real World Case Study & Experiment**

We are currently piloting this concept with 109 active users from a tech education business called Industry Connect. Students joined the "MVP tech community", a bit country we created, and conducted incentivized activities such as creating useful posts & making meaningful comments, abreast they earn country-specific tokens (e.g., MVPC). With the MVPC tokens they possess, they start to take ownership of the community and will be able to perform voting, decision making, and other governance rights/permissions. 

We've observed it is a great way to let students/users get more involved in our community by giving them ownership through their contributions. (Since a bit country can be created off-chain first, this will provide a path way for classic internet users to onboard to decentralized web.)

To further accelerate the engagement, we will build the 3D voxel world so that students/users can do more things and interact more with each other in that dimension. For instances, walk & chat, attend events in the 3D world or video meeting.

With the Substrate technology/decentralization, Bit.Country will become a popular place to nurture, manage and grow a community.

### Overview
  * **A brief description of the project.**

    In Bit.Country, you can create your own space, communities, economies, and digital assets (NFTs). The dapp allow users to socialize in both a classical web view and a 3D in-browser view of the country or block. The decentralized marketplace allows users to trade their digital assets (NFTs) with each other.
      
    Bit.Country network is a blockchain and ecosystem focusing on community, social and marketplace with a game feel. 

    Its runtime modules also create the open Protocol for Managing & Incentivizing Small-Medium Communities.
      
    **Countries**

    Create your own country and community. Attract more people to join using the rules and policies you can set by your will.

    Grow your country and monetize your community in multiple ways without any intermediaries.

    **Blocks**
            
    Content will belong to one of the blocks that make up the whole country. Each block has a topic the content within should adhere to. Each block can also be visualized in a 3D voxel view, in the 3D world, you can create assets on the sections you own.

    **Economy**

    Create currency for your country, or import your existing tokens and incentivize the people who contribute to your community.

    As your community grows, your currency will gain value on the exchange. Everyone in the community will benefit from this. Countries can be auctioned, rewarding all who had a stake in it. (Imagine a bit country with 100,000 active users)

    **Residents**

    Explore countries created by other people. Become a resident and join the community. Countries can set their residential policies.

    Some welcome everyone and even reward you for joining, while others may need you to apply for residency.

    **Asset with Smart Contract**

    While residents can build their assets on the sections that they own, there will be Smart Contract enabled Assets that can transact with residents or visitors.
    
    There will be boundless possibilities of Smart Assets that residents can build for their communities.

    **Ownership & Governance**

    Residents can earn the country tokens to take ownership and perform their governing rights by voting.

    **Marketplace**

    Trade your NFTs with residents within the same block, bit country, or entire network.

    We are building the decentralized marketplace into the Substrate module. The auctions and deliveries of items will be completely decentralized and governed by the blockchain network. Not only we are supporting our assets, also we will support more assets from the network.



  * **An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.**

    We will build Bit.Country Chain with Substrate technologies. Our system will build pallets for Bit.Country Chain specific requirements.
    
    After completing the milestones set below, we plan to **become a parachain** on Kusama first to nurture and grow our community and benefit from shared security and communications(XCMP). We will create and support more assets (NFTsï¼‰and make them available in Bit.Country as well as trading in the marketplace.
    
    When the community starts to gain momentum, we would like to become a parachain on the Polkadot network in the near future.
        

  * **An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.**

    Our founder, Ray Lu, had a vision of building a decentralized world in 2018. The premium domain name Bit.Country has been registered since then. 
    
    After learning Polkadot and Substrate technologies (Inspired by one of Polkadot teams based in NZ), we are very excited to finally find the right infrastructure and technology to develop this ambitious vision.

* An overview of the technology stack to be used

  Blockchain - Substrate, Rust  
  Frontend - ReactJs  
  Backend - .NET Core, C# & Mongol DB.

### Ecosystem Fit 

  Bit.Country concept is uniquely invented and inspired by the decentralisation paradigm. It will fit in well for growing and scaling the Polkadot/Substrate community.

  With our incubated EduTech business Industry Connect, and the prospected outcome of the project, naturally, it will bring more blockchain enthusiasts to Polkadot/Substrate community worldwide. 

  Combined with our community being introduced to Polkadot/Substrate through their education and internship experience, we will be enabling new developers interested in blockchain to get a head start on Polkadot and Substrate.
