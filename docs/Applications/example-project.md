## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

We are building a Substrate RPC client in the programming language XYZ. The client will be modeled after polkadot-js/api. We want to lower the friction of using XYZ with Substrate and believe this will benefit the whole ecosystem. An XYZ client will help us with our own parachain project.
