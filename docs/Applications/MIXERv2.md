## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview
- We will extend our zero-knowledge mixer to support Arkworks proving backends
- We will extend our pallets to support multi currency support from ORML and pallet-assets
- We will build out the functionality for integrating this into front-end dApp applications.
- We will build out a CLI and a transaction relayer for using the mixer and securely storing notes in local DBs.
-
### Ecosystem Fit 
With newer projects using both ORML tokens and Substrate using pallet-assets, it makes sense to extend the mixer functionality to include various types of assets so that native tokens aren't the only available token for mixing.

### Team's experience
Our team has deep experience building on Substrate and growing experience building zero-knowledge proof based applications. I have been building on Substrate for 2 years and helped launch Edgeware. We also shipped an initial grant to build out the pallets for native token support using bulletproofs zero-knowledge arguments.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense |
| 0b. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 0c. | Testing Guide | The code will have unit-test coverage (min. 70%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 0d. | Article/Tutorial | We will write an article or tutorial that explains the work done as part of the grant. 
| 1. | Substrate module: Multi-Asset support for mixer | We will extend the mixer for ORML libraries and pallet-assets libraries. |
| 1a. | Substrate module: ORML support | Plug and play functionality for ORML tokens |
| 1b. | Substrate module: Pallet asset support | Plug and play functionality for Asset module |
| 2. | Substrate module: New ZKP backend support | We will add new backends to our pallets to allow users more flexibility over their target ZKP system. |
| 2a. | Substrate module: New ZKP backend support | Groth16 style proofs using BLS381, BN254 |
| 2b. | Substrate module: ZKP backend support | Bulletproof style proofs using Curve25519 |
| 2c. | Substrate module: New ZKP hash function support | More Poseidon configurations, MIMC |
| 3. | Zero-knowledge circuits | We will create new zero-knowledge circuits for mixer functionality using the Arkworks backend, which allows us to plug and play with different elliptic curves and SNARKs. |

    - [ ]  Add support to the merkle tree pallet for circuit specific setups using arbitrary backends (Groth16, Bulletproofs)
    - [ ]  Augment mixer data structure with setup/backend.
    - [ ]  Tests
- [ ] Add multi-currency support using widely used trait implementations from ORML and pallet-assetst.
    - [ ] Add ORML token style support
    - [ ] Add pallet-asset style support
    - [ ] Augment mixer creation flow to support creation for arbitrary token types and denominations.

**Circuit**

- [ ] A hash preimage circuit
- [ ] A non-zero circuit and bounded number circuit
- [ ] A merkle tree proof verification circuit
- [ ] Support for fees inside these circuits.
- [ ] All using `arkworks`

# Zero-knowledge Circuit

### Merkle Tree

Definitions: Secret Key(S), Public key(P), Nullifier (N), Leaf(L), Hash function(H), Secret Key  (SC), Public Key (PC), Merkle Root (R), Merkle Path (MP), Circuit Proof (ZKP)

- Leaf insert: User calculates L = H(S, N), submits L to the tree (add_member func)
- Proof of creation:
    - User submits L, SC, N, verifier calculates if H(SC, N) == L
    - Public: N
    - Private: S, L (really L gets replaced with path in membership section)
    - Relation: H(S, N)=L
- Proof of membership: User submits the path in zero knowledge
    - Public: R
    - Private: MP - Vec<(Scalar, u8)>
    - Relation: compute_root(H(S,N), MP) = R
- Verify:
    - User submits N, ZKP
    - If N exists, return
    - If N doesn't exist, store it if successful verification

### Commitments (leaves) in merkle trees

- Public nullifier_hash or serial number ***sn***.
- Merkle tree root

**Private variables to Spend (fixed deposit tree)**
