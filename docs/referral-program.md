title: 💰 Referral Program
---

We give away 500 USD to each referral of a successful grant application by _anyone having previously worked on a Web3 Foundation grant_ or _a [Polkadot Ambassador](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ambassadors)_. Web3 Foundation and Parity employees do not qualify for the program, even if they previously worked on a grant.

In order to be eligible for the referral bonus, the application itself must contain the name of the [Polkadot Ambassador](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/ambassadors) or the GitHub account of the grantee as well as the payment address for the referral bonus (see the [application template](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/application-template.md)). Payment is made in USDT/USDC on Polkadot AssetHub.
