# Guidelines

While applications are open to all, the W3F grants program prioritizes projects with a **strong technical focus** that demonstrably add value to the Polkadot ecosystem. Furthermore, successful applicants will be expected to present a solid and compelling long-term roadmap, supported by evidence of the project's significance to the community. This could include:

- Research-oriented projects: Demonstrated significance to the community and potential impact through academic publications or community engagement metrics.
- Business-oriented projects: A comprehensive market analysis documenting target audience, market size, competitive landscape, and go-to-market strategy.
- Open-source projects: Proven experience in building strong communities, evidenced by user adoption, active development contributions, and community engagement initiatives.

Generally, your project will have better chances to be accepted if:

- it presents a **well-researched** or tested concept, for which ideally you are able to show some prior work;
- you have tangible proof of how and to what extent the project is a **benefit to the Polkadot ecosystem** and its users;
- you can demonstrate that the project will be **maintained** after completion of the grant, be it through an obvious commitment to the technology from your side, additional funding sources, or an existing business model;
- your team has **proven experience** with the relevant languages and technologies and/or a strong technical background. You will be asked to provide the GitHub profiles of your team members as part of your application, which we will examine for past activity and code quality. Naturally, you can also link to projects on other platforms;
- your application is **rich in technical details** and well-defined;
- you can present how your project stands out among competitors or implements technology that **doesn't exist** in the ecosystem yet.

Additionally, it must fulfill the following requirements:

- All code produced as part of a grant must be **open-sourced**, and it must also not rely on closed-source software for full functionality. We prefer Apache 2.0, but GPLv3, MIT, or Unlicense are also acceptable.
- We do not award grants for projects that have been the object of a successful **token sale**.
- Applications must not mention a specific **token**. Furthermore, the focus of the application should lie on the **software** that is being implemented/research being carried out as part of the grant and less on your project/venture/operation. For the purpose of the application and delivery, think about how others might also benefit from your work.
- As a general rule, teams are asked to **finish a grant** before applying for another one.
- Lastly, we **do not fund** projects that actively encourage gambling, illicit trade, money laundering, or criminal activities in general.
- The beneficiaries of the grant must successfully go through a **KYC/KYB check** during the application phase in order to be eligible.

In addition to the information provided on your application, note that your project will need to comply with our [Guidelines for Milestone Deliverables](../Support%20Docs/milestone-deliverables-guidelines.md). In particular, we require all projects to create documentation that explains how their project works. At a minimum, _written_ documentation is required for funding. Tutorials or videos are also helpful for new users to understand how to use your product.

Please also heed our [Announcement Guidelines](../Support%20Docs/announcement-guidelines.md) for grant-related communications.

Finally, we take licensing and the right of all teams in and outside the ecosystem to be recognized for their work very seriously. Using others' work with no attribution or indication that this was not your own work as part of a milestone delivery **will lead to immediate termination**. Please reach out to us before submitting if you have any doubts on how to comply with a specific license and we'll be happy to help.

We also try to enforce our [code of conduct](../../CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and, based on this, may [block users](https://github.blog/2016-04-04-organizations-can-now-block-abusive-users/).
