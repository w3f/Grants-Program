# Support

The scope of our Grants Programs consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources. Generally, Parity's [Alpha Program](https://polkadot.com/alpha-program), which provides strategical long-term support and access to various resources, is available for anyone to join. You can find general documentation and more information on Polkadot and the Polkadot SDK on [polkadot.com](https://docs.polkadot.com/), and we encourage you to join the [community](https://polkadot.com/community/) in order to get help with specific issues or to stay up to date with the most recent developments. 

For real-time conversations, check out the Polkadot Developer Support groups on [Telegram](https://t.me/substratedevs) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#substratedevs:matrix.org).

For questions about the grants program itself, see our [FAQ](docs/faq.md#frequently-asked-questions).
