# Support

The scope of our Grants Programs consists of funding and feedback on delivered milestones. This means that we do not provide hands-on support as part of a grant, but if you face specific issues during development, we will do our best and try to direct you to the correct resources. You can find general documentation and more information on Polkadot and the Polkadot SDK on [polkadot.com](https://docs.polkadot.com/), and we encourage you to join the [community](https://polkadot.com/community/) in order to get help with specific issues or to stay up to date with the most recent developments. 

For real-time conversations, check out the Polkadot Developer Support groups on [Telegram](https://t.me/substratedevs) and [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#substratedevs:matrix.org).

For questions about the grants program itself, see our [FAQ](docs/faq.md#frequently-asked-questions).
