## :grey_question: What is an RFP?

An RFP (Request for Proposals) is a declaration of interest for others to submit a grant application regarding a specific project. They usually revolve around issues that the author (often someone from our team, but [anyone can suggest one](../suggesting_a_project.md)) deems useful and missing or unsolved in our ecosystem.

If you find an open RFP here that you think you can address, feel free to [submit a grant application](../Process/index.md). There is a [section in our application template](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/applications/application-template.md#project-overview-page_facing_up) where you can reference the RFP you are addressing.


## 📜 List of RFPs

**Status:**

- **🟢 Open:** We are looking for (additional) teams to implement this.
- **🟡 Under Development:** One or more teams are working on this. We might be interested in additional implementations, but it’s better to double check this with the grants team.  
- **🔴 Implemented:** This RFP is implemented. However, if it’s not maintained, we would be interested in signing a [maintenance grant](../maintenance.md).

## :mailbox_with_mail: Suggest an RFP

If you think that we should support the development of certain tools or projects (related to **Polkadot, Kusama or Substrate**) that aren't in the Polkadot/Kusama [tech stack](https://wiki.polkadot.network/docs/build-open-source), please submit a suggestion using the process described in our [Grants program README](../suggesting_a_project.md). We are particularly interested in supporting projects that could be leveraged by other builders in our ecosystem.
