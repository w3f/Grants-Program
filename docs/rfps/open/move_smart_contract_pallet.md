# Move Smart Contract Pallet
* **Status:** Open

## Project Description :page_facing_up:  

The Move Virtual Machine (MoveVM) was initially developed by Facebook and is now maintained by the Aptos Foundation.  Move is a smart contract programming language that emphasises access control and scarcity.

[Pontem Network](https://pontem.network/) initially developed the [Move virtual machine pallet](https://github.com/pontem-network/pontem/tree/master/pallets/sp-mvm) to execute Move smart-contracts on Substrate-based chains. However, they stopped working on this pallet to focus on other initiatives. 

The purpose of this RFP is to find other teams that are willing to pick up this initial work and continue with it or work on their own implementation of the Move virtual machine in Substrate.

## Deliverables

The structure of the grant and the milestones depends highly on the project itself. Itâ€™s therefore up to the applying team to come up with a milestone and delivery structure.
