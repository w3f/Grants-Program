## Project Description :page_facing_up:

The Upchain Specification, a framework for securing Substrate runtime upgrades and Substrate network upgrades, by extending The Update Framework and modeled on Uptane (The Update Framework Specification extended for automobiles).

Iâ€™ve come across several reports of a para-relay chain update/upgrade going awry and a chain is bricked, unable to produce blocks - hi-jinx ensue, and everyone lives happily ever after.

One such case is discussed here: [How to recover a parachain](<https://forum.polkadot.network/t/how-to-recover-a-parachain/673>). The consensus appears to be: Automatic rollback is not possible, and a Parachain being inoperable for some period is the way things will be (hi-jinx required).

Potential utility for the wider community is evidenced by the [Polkadot Summit: Barcamp (30 Nov, 1 Dec) topic Parachain Emergency Recovery](https://forum.polkadot.network/t/polkadot-summit-barcamp-submit-agenda-topics-30-nov-1-dec/669/8)

The Upchain specification envisioned here would also serve as an outline of the implementation requirements.

There is considerable prior art to inform and guide the initial specification.
A greenfield design should not be accepted.

Rather, the Milestone 2 document accompanying the design specification should reference:

* [The Uptane Standard for Design and Implementation 2.0.0](https://uptane.github.io/papers/uptane-standard.2.0.0.html)
* [The Update Framework Specification](https://theupdateframework.github.io/specification/latest/)

Articulating:

* Deviations
  * The section number and title in the Uptane and TUF specification that Upchain should deviate from.
  * The Relay-parachain functionality lost or gained by this deviation, described in terms of TUF/Uptane functionality
* Extensions
  * The section number and title in the Uptane and TUF specification that should be extended by Upchain
  * The Relay-parachain functionality removed or added by this extension, described in terms of TUF/Uptane functionality
* Omissions
  * The section number and title in the Uptane and TUF specification that should be omitted from Upchain
  * The Relay-parachain functionality lost or gained by this omission, described in terms of TUF/Uptane functionality

Specifically, elements of these two specifications should not silently vanish.
