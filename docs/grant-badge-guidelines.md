# Guidelines for Web3 Foundation Grants Program Badge

<img align="right" width="400" src="../src/badge_black.svg">

**Once the grants committee accepted a project's first milestone**, we want to help them acknowledge their grants publicly while observing the foundation’s guidelines.

To that end, we’ve created a badge for grant-winning teams. The badge in four formats will be available for download as a “.zip” file from [web3.foundation/grants/badge](https://web3.foundation/grants/badge). Think of it like a medal or trophy.

*Before you begin using the badge, please note the following points:*

- Grants are awarded **for specific projects**, not to teams in general as a blanket endorsement.
- Web3 Foundation and its grants program **don’t broker partnerships or joint ventures**; or cosign wholesale any external team’s work. Bearing that in mind, **the badge should only be displayed in project-specific contexts.**
- Please **do**: display the badge
  - in a GitHub repository that contains code connected with the grant-winning project;
  - on any project-specific webpages; and,
  - when appropriate, in a tweet or blog post announcing your grant in a project-specific context.
- Please **don’t**:
  - display the badge on your team’s landing page;
  - add it to any social media profiles; or
  - use it in any contexts that could misrepresent your relationship with the Web3 Foundation.

Also, please don't use the **name or logo of the Web3 Foundation** in any contexts that could misrepresent your relationship with Web3 Foundation. Infringement of these guidelines can result in an immediate annulment of the grant.

In case of any questions, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at grants@web3.foundation.
