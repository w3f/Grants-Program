# Browser based IDE for ink! Smart Contracts 

* **Status:** Open
* **Proposer:** [David Hawig](https://github.com/Noc2)

## Project Description :page_facing_up:  

[ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) is a domain-specific language for writing smart contracts in Rust and compiles to Wasm code. You can deploy ink! contracts on parachains that support the contracts pallet, as well as on stand-alone blockchains built with Substrate.

The goal of this RFP is to find teams that would like to develop or maintain a browser-based playground for editing, compiling & sharing ink! smart contracts. The [ink! Playground](https://ink-playground.substrate.io/), previously maintained by Parity, utilizes Typescript, React, Docker, and [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Teams could continue to work on the [ink! Playground](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground), or choose to build something new if desired. For example, it might be possible to leverage GitHub Codespaces in combination with GitHub Actions or the previously developed [ink! Remix plugin](https://github.com/blockchain-it-hr/ink-remix-plugin).

## Deliverables

The structure of the grant and the milestones depends highly on the project itself. Itâ€™s therefore up to the applying team to come up with a milestone and delivery structure.
