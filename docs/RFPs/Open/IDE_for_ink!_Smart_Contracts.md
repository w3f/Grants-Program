# Browser based IDE for ink! Smart Contracts 

* **Status:** Open
* **Proposer:** [David Hawig](https://github.com/Noc2)

## Project Description :page_facing_up:  

[ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) is a domain-specific language for writing smart contracts in Rust and compiles to Wasm code. You can deploy ink! contracts on parachains that support the contracts pallet, as well as on stand-alone blockchains built with Substrate.

The goal of this RFP is to find teams that would like to develop or maintain a browser based playground for editing, sharing & compiling ink! Smart Contracts. We are hereby specifically looking for a developer or team that wants to continue to work on the [ink! Playground](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground). The [ink! Playground](https://ink-playground.substrate.io/), previously maintained by Parity, currently utilizes Typescript, React, Docker, and [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/). Teams could stick with this tech stack, or choose to build something new if desired. For example, there has been some discussion around the viability of implementing GitHub Codespaces in combination with GitHub Actions and previously teams developed a [Remix plugin](https://github.com/blockchain-it-hr/ink-remix-plugin).

**Useful resources:**
- [ink!](https://use.ink/)
- [ink-playground](https://ink-playground.substrate.io)
- [GitHub ink-playground](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground)
- [GitHub: ink! Remix plugin](https://github.com/blockchain-it-hr/ink-remix-plugin)

## Deliverables

The structure of the grant and the milestones depends highly on the project itself. Itâ€™s therefore up to the applying team to come up with a milestone and delivery structure.
