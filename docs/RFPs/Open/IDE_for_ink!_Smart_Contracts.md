# Browser based IDE for ink! Smart Contracts 

* **Status:** Open
* **Proposer:** [David Hawig](https://github.com/Noc2)

## Project Description :page_facing_up:  

[ink!](https://github.com/paritytech/ink) is a domain-specific language for writing smart contracts in Rust and compiles to Wasm code. You can use it with blockchains built on Substrate.

The goal of this RFP is to find teams that would like to develop or maintain a browser based playground for editing, sharing & compiling ink! Smart Contracts. We are hereby specifically looking for a developer or team that wants to continue to work on the [ink! Playground](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground), which was originally developed and maintained by Parity. But we are also actively looking for teams that want to implement alternative solutions, like, for example, something based on [http://remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org/). 

**Useful resources:**
- [ink!](https://use.ink/)
- [ink-playground](https://ink-playground.substrate.io)
- [GitHub ink-playground](https://github.com/paritytech/ink-playground)
- [GitHub: ink! Remix plugin](https://github.com/blockchain-it-hr/ink-remix-plugin)

## Deliverables

The structure of the grant and the milestones depends highly on the project itself. Itâ€™s therefore up to the applying team to come up with a milestone and delivery structure.
