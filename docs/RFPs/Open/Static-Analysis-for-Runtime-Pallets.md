## Project Description :page_facing_up:  

[Runtime Pallets](https://docs.substrate.io/fundamentals/runtime-development/) are modules for writing the business logic of blockchains in [Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) (a Rust framework fo rbuilding blockchians). These are usually concise pieces of standalone code with relatively few dependencies and clear specifications, hence tractable targets for performing static analysis and verification. We would like to develop tools and techniques to perform static analysis with reasonable soundness guarantees. In particular, we would like to target vunerability classes that are detectable using dataflow analysis techniques like *tag analysis* and *taint analysis*. Just to give a flavor, relevant might vulnerabilities include:
* [incorrect origin](https://github.com/bhargavbh/MIRAI/blob/main/substrate_examples/incorrect-origin/description.md) of dispatchable functions. 
* [unsigned transaction](https://github.com/bhargavbh/MIRAI/blob/main/substrate_examples/unsigned-transaction/description.md) validation.
* tracking bad randomness: ensure bad randomness does not leak into sensitive functions.
* detect panics statically to avoid potential DoS attacks: these include [unsafe arithmetic operations](https://github.com/bhargavbh/MIRAI/blob/main/substrate_examples/arithmetic-overflow/description.md), access outside bounds, assertion failures, etc.
* tracking unsanitised input leakage for sensitive functions.

We seek applications that either extend existing static analysers for rust like [MIRAI](https://github.com/facebookexperimental/MIRAI/), [Prusti](https://www.pm.inf.ethz.ch/research/prusti.html), or build Rust front-ends to static analysis engines. Our preliminary feasibility study shows that MIRAI would be a good starting point as it includes a tag analysis framework, however, we are open to other tools and techniques.
