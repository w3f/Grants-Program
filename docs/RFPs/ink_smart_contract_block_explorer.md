## Project Description :page_facing_up: 

We are looking for a team or multiple teams to implement [ink! smart contract](https://paritytech.github.io/ink/) block explorer. Ink! is a domain specific language for writing smart contracts in Rust and compiles to Wasm code.

## Deliverables

The structure of the grant and the milestones depends highly on the supported features of the block explorer.
