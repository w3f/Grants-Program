The W3F Grants Program aims to be as open and accessible as possible. If you are interested in contributing or getting involved, there are several ways you can do that:

- We are open to milestone evaluations from third parties. If you are particularly interested in a certain project, or particularly knowledgeable on a relevant subject, [submit your own evaluation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery#ballot_box_with_check-external-evaluations).
- We encourage anyone to submit a request for proposals (RFPs). If you find that there is something missing in our ecosystem (a tool, a project, infrastructure, etc.), that we could help fund, please [submit an RFP](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project).
- Join us! We are looking for a Technical Grants Evaluator (among other things) to join us full time. Check out [our current job openings](https://web3.bamboohr.com/jobs/) and apply!

We strive to continue improving our grants program and are always open to feedback. If you would like to share any suggestions or criticism, please reach out to us on [Github](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/#w3f:matrix.org)!
