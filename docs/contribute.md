The W3F Grants Program aims to be as open and accessible as possible. If you are interested in contributing or getting involved, there are several ways you can do that:

📋 We are open to milestone evaluations from third parties. If you are particularly interested in a certain project, or particularly knowledgeable on a relevant subject, feel free to comment on any [open grant applications](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22ready+for+review%22+sort%3Aupdated-desc), or have a look at the [open pull requests on our milestone delivery repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/pulls) and [submit your own evaluation](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery#ballot_box_with_check-external-evaluations).

🔍 If you find that there is something missing in our ecosystem (a tool, a project, infrastructure, etc.) that we could help fund, please [submit a Request For Proposals (RFP)](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project). If writing an RFP seems too daunting a task, feel free to [submit it as an issue on our Github repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/issues) so anyone can contribute.

🤝 Join us! We are looking for a Technical Grants Evaluator (among other things) to join us full time. Check out [our current job openings](https://web3.bamboohr.com/jobs/) and apply!

We strive to continue improving our grants program and are always open to feedback. If you would like to share any suggestions or criticism, please reach out to us on [Github](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program) or [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!XpynPDLusWUWfDpaqr:matrix.org?via=web3.foundation&via=matrix.org)!
