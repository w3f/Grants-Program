**Ecosystem Funding Office Hours** are a chance to ask the W3F Ecosystem Funding team questions regarding a specific project, a (potential) grant application or about funding opportunities in general. It offers

- **general guidance** regarding the various funding and support programs,
- some quick **initial feedback** about project ideas, RFPs, roadmaps, etc. and
- help how to navigate the ecosystem and to find the right resources.

Applying is as simple as giving us a brief description of the project or idea you are working on and what questions you would like to discuss. To do so, please fill out the [W3F Ecosystem Development Contact Form](https://forms.gle/APhGNd1BCMVZJCNR6). We will then follow up with questions and/or an invitation to book a 30-minute call with one of our Ecosystem Development team members. Be as specific as possible, so we can help you as efficiently as possible. 

:::tip
Please note: Office Hours is **not** a chance to _pitch_ your project, especially since the various programs and prizes have different evaluation criteria and decision makers and only a small subset of the Ecosystem Development team will participate in the call.
