## 4.  Procedure

To apply for the Web 3.0 Foundation Open Grants Program, your application shall fulfill the following criteria:

-  it shall be a software-based project, which contributes to the advancement of the Polkadot ecosystem;
-  the total amount of funding requested for the project shall be below USD  30,000 and USD 100,000 for follow-up grants at the time of submission;
-  the Software shall be released under the Apache license version 2.0.;
-  You must accept payment in the blockchain tokens native to the Bitcoin Network ("BTCs") or the Ethereum based stablecoin DAI;
-  You will need to submit the application and deliver the milestones according to the process specified below;

The open grants process consists of five parts, each of them described in more detail below:

**(i)  Grant application process:**

To apply for a grant of the Web 3.0  Foundation Open Grants Program, You shall comply with the procedures established in the README.md file under <https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program> as well as the process defined inside this document.

To apply for a grant of the Web3 Foundation Open Grants Program, the grantee needs to fork (= create a copy on GitHub of) the Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository. In the newly created fork (=copy on GitHub), the grantee has to create a copy of the application-template.md. The copied application-template.md needs to be renamed as "project_name.md". "Project_name" needs to be replaced with the name of the project application. Additionally, the grantee has to fill out all mandatory parts of the application-template.md presented in bold letters. Once the grantees have completed the application, they need to create a new pull request (= in this case, a mechanism to submit the changes of the fork to the original Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository) by clicking on the "create new pull request" button shown inside the fork of the W3F Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository. After this, the grantee needs to sign off the terms and conditions presented via the CLA assistant.

**(ii)  Application review process:**

The Web 3.0 grants committee, which is specified on the [Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository ](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program)(the "Grants Committee"), can issue comments and request changes on the grant application pull request (the submission of the grant application on GitHub).  As soon as 1/3 of the Grants Committee approves the pull request, the terms and conditions are signed off and all requested changes are addressed, the application is officially accepted. The application is now a part of the [W3F Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program). The time point of the acceptance by the Grants Committee is hereby stored on GitHub and counts as the official beginning of the grant. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party. The final version approved by the Grants Committee of the Specifications, the Time Schedule and Milestones will be placed  in the applications folder of the W3F Open Grants Program Repository at <https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master/applications> via the merge function of GitHub.

**(iii)  Milestone delivery process:**

To submit one of the possible multiple milestones specified in the application, You shall fork the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery) with the same Github account, used to submit the initial application. In the newly created fork, You shall create a copy of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). Such [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) needs to be renamed as "project_name_milestone_number.md". "Project_name" needs to be replaced with the name of the project application and milestone number with the number of the delivered milestone. Additionally, You shall fill out all mandatory parts of the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md) as well as the invoice form linked inside the [milestone-delivery-template.md](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/blob/master/deliveries/milestone-delivery-template.md). Once You have completed the milestone delivery document, You shall create a new pull request by clicking on the "create new pull request" button shown inside their fork of the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery).

**(iv)  Milestone review process:**

The Grants Evaluators, who are specified on the [Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program), can issue comments and request changes on the milestone delivery pull request. 

a)  Purpose and object of the milestone review process

The purpose of the milestone review process is to examine whether the  Milestones and/or Software meets the requirements agreed in the Specifications. The milestone review process shall take place following the submission of each milestone as specified in the time schedule.

The test criteria that must be met in order for the Milestones and/or Software to be considered as acceptable by Web 3.0 are determined in the Specifications.

The milestone review process shall be deemed to have been successfully completed if no significant defects are found in any of the Milestones and/or Development Work. Insignificant defects shall not prevent acceptance by Web 3.0.

b)  Acceptance Procedure

If any of the Milestones and/or the Software does not meet the test, review or inspection criteria, Web 3.0 shall grant You a period of 14 days to rectify the defects and any deviations from the Specifications found and objected to during the milestone review process. Rectification shall be free of charge for Web 3.0.

If You are unable to remedy the defects within this additional period, You shall be considered to be in default, without any additional notice by Web 3.0.

In the event of default, Web 3.0 may either, at its discretion:

- insist on the rectification of the milestones and/or the Software;
- delegate the completion of the Software to a third party at your expenses;
- reduce payment of the Grant because of the reduced value of the Software; or
- refuse payment of the Grant in full (for the avoidance of doubt, this may require You to refund all milestone and advance payments made under these Terms and Conditions).

As soon as one evaluator approves the pull request, the delivery is officially accepted. The delivery is now a part of the [Grant Milestone Delivery GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery). The time point of the acceptance by the evaluator is hereby stored on GitHub. The original submission is stored with a unique commit hash (identifier) and can not be altered by any party.

**(v)  Payment process:**

The Operations Team specified in the [Open-Grants-Program GitHub repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program), gets notified once the above-specified delivery was accepted or after 2 weeks without any feedback after the initial delivery. As soon as any feedback is provided by the evaluators, this feedback first needs to be resolved. After this, the Operations Team makes the payment to the BTC or Ethereum address specified in the initial application.

## 5.  Scope of these Terms and Conditions

The subject matter of these Terms and Conditions is (i) the development of the Software by You in accordance with the Specifications, Milestones and Time Schedule, as well as any related activities (including any development activities undertaken before the Effective Date in relation to the Software) (collectively referred to as "Development Work") in accordance with the terms of these Terms and Conditions.
