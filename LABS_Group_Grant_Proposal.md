# LABS Group Grant Proposal
* **Project:** LABS Group
* **Proposer:** [LABSGroupIO](https://github.com/LABSGroupIO)
* **Payment Address:** 3M51Q6tjAHun6sxqKpTygY5ao4p7hKF2cF


## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 
LABS Group is an end to end real estate digitisation ecosystem on blockchain which consists of advisory, issuance and crowdfunding platforms, as well as a licensed digital security exchange. Its vision is to disrupt the largest asset class investment by solving the illiquidity and high costs of investment issues. This will be mainly done by fractionalisation by digitisation in security tokens and the offering of digital trading through both DeFi and CeFi solutions.

### Overview
LABS Group wants to bring the worlds first end to end real estate digitisation investment ecosystem mainstream. We will offer users a new way to invest and exit real estate investments all within our ecosystem. We will be the first to offer a full real estate securities exchange and crowdfunding ecosystem powered by the LABS token which powers our DeFi GAINS model which stands for Governance, Access, Incentives, Nomination, Staking. All of this stands to benefit the LABS Group ecosystem userbase. 

LABS is going to build on Polkadot for its token issuance platform, Securities Exchange and DEFI application in the real estate industry. LABS is going to incorporate Polkadot chain for fractionalizing real estate assets and building smart contracts and deal flows based on polkadot’s infrastructure. LABS will take advantage of Polkadot's cross chain technology to bring in existing projects built on other chains into our real estate ecosystem. Lastly our governance protocol will be built on Polkadot to power our GAINS Model within our ecosystem of a crowdfunding platform and our securities exchange.

LABS believes real estate, being the largest single asset class, should be made accessible to all people and not just to a select few who are privileged. This will in turn encourage financial inclusion which most governments encourage.  By building this ecosystem and thereby disrupting the real estate investment world through fractionalization, this allows everyone with a chance to get involved in sharing the fruits of economic growth, locally or globally. We want to offer investments that are faster and more efficient then the traditional real investment market therefore cutting out middle men and having an automated system handle all real estate transactions on chain

LABS team's vision is to help to build a fairer and more equal world while allowing the users to make the decisions.

### Project Details
LABS Group intends to democratize the traditional real estate investment world by fractionalizing real estate to allow everyone access to investment. 

LABS Group Ecosystem
* Advisory and Consultancy
* Crowdfunding platform for raising money for real estate developments and unit sales
* Primary security token issuance platform
* Licensed Real Estate focused Security Exchange
* Governance and Staking with LABS Token 

** Crowdfunding Platform (Built)

* Design the crowdfunding platform based on blockchain tech with polkadot parachain 
* Design the project smart contract to be project based tokens
* Display the project information to be known by potential investors
* Design the token standards and specifications for security asset tokens

** Primary Security Token Issuance Platform (Built)

* Display the means and methods to comply with security laws
* Design the token standards and specifications for security asset tokens
* Define the investors qualifications based on the jurisdictions
* Issue the security tokens for each project
* Define the security token sell or trading restrictions based on jurisdictions
* Smart contracts are built and defined by KYC and AML which is controlled by the LABS platform
* Whitelist 3rd party exchanges to all security tokens to move in and out of wallets while controlling KYC and AML

** Real Estate Securities Exchange (LABS Exchange)

* Connect the KYC with the security token issuance platform to verify the security aspects of tokens
* Provide liquidity of security tokens
* Verify the KYC and AML restrictions on security token trading based on the jurisdictions
* Determine the asset price on the exchange based on the liquidity of asset 

** LABS Utility Token for Governance and Staking

* Setup the functions on LABS platform that support the utility functions of the LABS tokens
* Design the rule of labs token for governing on the community operations (refer to GAINS model above)
* Setup staking mechanism for LABS rewards with LABS tokens in the ecosystem

** Implementation 

LABS real estate investment DAPP will be a substrate module application, We will combine the smart contracts of properties on the LABS platform with blockchain infrastructure (DEFI applications) to provide the liquify of assets and it will be a in pair token with cross chain functions on Polkadot. There is going to be an interface to be built between those asset tokens and Defi tokens based on those assets.

We will implement the LABS protocol as two parts:
* A substrate node that implements Labs DAPP protocol.
* A project that can initiate a smart contract and it will connect to the “mirroring interface” in order to get the cross chain token within the polk ecosystem. 

We will only build DAPP in this grant since the whole project is too large to be implemented in only one grant. 
 
### Ecosystem Fit

There are some real estate tokenization projects which pertain to primary issuance only, but none of those are a full ecosystem like LABS Group, LABS Group is able to build an ecosystem engaging DEFI and CEFI to tokenize real estate assets, and more importantly, LABS owns a Security Exchange license which enables our investors to invest within the LABS Ecosystem. to build a STO real estate business including issuing platform, security exchange, DeFi application to provide liquidity to real estate market.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

### Overview
* **Total Estimated Duration:**  3.5 Months
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):** 4
* **Total Costs:** 1 BTC

### Milestone 1 Implement Polkadot substrate into LABS Group Crowdfunding platform
* **Estimated Duration:** 2 month
* **FTE:**  2.5
* **Costs:** 0.5 BTC

The major deliverable of this milestone is the substrate pallet that supports the basic moonbeam for real estate tokens on the LABS Group crowdfunding platform:

1: Implement polkadot substrate into LABS Group crowdfunding in which a real estate security token can be created, transferred and transaction can be checked on Polkadot's public blockchain.

2: Create RPC-Ethereum module as a compatibility layer for Ethereum’s Web3 RPC API methods based on Moonbeam.

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicensed |
| 1. | Documentation | We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one Moonbeam node. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions and deploy a smart contract that will show how the new functionality works. |
| 2. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 3. | Moonbeam | Setup Moonbeam node | We will join the Polkadot parachain via Moonbeam Alpha testnet network to get familiar with the technology, so that we have an idea in customizing our own blockchain network with Substrate during Milestone 2. 
| 4. | Solidity Smart Contract | We will develop smart contracts and deploy on Moonbeam Alpha testnet for testing.
| 5. | Substrate Framework | We will develop our own blockchain network specifically design for LABS project base on the research and reference from Moonbeam.
| 6. |Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |

### Milestone 2 Governance and Staking and Utility Token
* **Estimated Duration:** 1.5 months
* **FTE:**  2
* **Costs:** 0.5 BTC

The major deliverable of this milestone is the smart contract for governance and staking with the LABS token. LABS will set up the nodes for LABS interacting with Substrate tools:

1: Create Substrate-based LABS chain that is fully compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, 

2: Using Substrate tools and designing Substrate runtime functions for LABS nodes to interact with polkadot chain. The Substrate runtime checks signatures and handles any extrinsic. Smart contract calls are ultimately passed to the EVM to execute the state transitions.

3: Setup governance and staking smart contracts on Polkadot's public blockchain for the operation, it includes the staking function for governance structures. This is meant to be built on a decentralized platform, everyone can vote with their LABS token for their part. 

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a.| License | Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicensed |
| 1. | Substrate module: Raft | We will create Raft module as an implementation of a Raft-based consensus mechanism (using TiKV’s Raft implementation) as an alternative to Ethereum’s default proof-of-work. This is useful for closed-membership/consortium settings where byzantine fault tolerance is not a requirement, and there is a desire for faster block times (on the order of milliseconds instead of seconds) and transaction finality (the absence of forking). |
| 2. | Substrate module: Permissioning| We will create Permissioning module as part of network permissioning model which controls which nodes can connect to a given node and also to which nodes the given node can dial out to.|
| 3. | Substrate module: EVM | We will create EVM module which is fully Rust-based EVM implementation based on SputnikVM with all gas related stuff stripped off for the special purpose of consortium chain. It provides the state transition logic for LABS-based smart contracts. 
| 4. | Substrate module: RPC-Ethereum | We will create RPC-Ethereum module as a compatibility layer for Ethereum’s Web3 RPC API methods based on Moonbeam, Edgeware or Frontier. 
| 5. | LABS chain | We will create Substrate-based LABS chain that is fully compatible with Ethereum's Web3 API and EVM, but with all gas related stuff stripped off for the special purpose of consortium chain. In order to better cater for diverse enterprise-level needs, our LABS chain is designed to support multiple consensus mechanisms such as PoA, Ripple, Tendermint and so on other than Raft, and advanced features like enhanced network permissioning as well as private transactions will be added. In addition, both on-chain governance mechanics and cross-chain integration are in our plans based on Substrate and Polkadot technique stacks.
| 6. |Docker | We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain |
