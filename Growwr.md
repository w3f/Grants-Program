## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

**Tagline:**

Empowering Africa’s workforce with AI and blockchain—building a transparent, trustless, and borderless future of work on Polkadot.
 
**Description:**

Growwr is an AI-powered work platform designed to connect verified African professionals with global businesses while ensuring trust, payment security, and transparency through blockchain technology. Today, 74% of freelancers across Africa experience payment delays of up to three months, and 16% never receive payment at all. Beyond that, millions remain excluded from financial systems—lacking access to credit, insurance, or even device financing.

Growwr solves these systemic challenges by merging AI and Web3. Our platform uses AI engines for talent verification, chemistry-fit matching, and performance intelligence, while integrating Polkadot’s blockchain to ensure trustless payments, on-chain work credentials, and transparent work histories. Every transaction and verified contribution will be recorded on Polkadot, creating an immutable professional identity that eliminates fraud, bias, and opacity in the hiring process.
By deploying on Polkadot, Growwr leverages its scalable multi-chain architecture, interoperability, and low-cost transactions to build a high-throughput infrastructure for millions of micro-transactions between businesses and workers. Our vision is to make Polkadot the core trust layer for the future of work across emerging markets—powering verified identity, instant cross-border payments, and decentralized professional reputation systems.

**Why We’re Building This:**
Our journey is deeply personal. In 2021, Growwr’s founder lost 17 international contracts simply because of nationality—a reflection of the systemic bias and payment insecurity facing over 300 million skilled professionals across emerging markets. That experience inspired the creation of Growwr: a platform that restores trust, opportunity, and inclusion using AI and blockchain.
Polkadot’s ecosystem offers the ideal foundation to scale this vision. With its Substrate framework and interoperable design, we can build a future-ready infrastructure that connects verified talent to global opportunities—securely, transparently, and without borders.

### Project Details

Growwr is building a trustless AI-powered work infrastructure on Polkadot, enabling verified identity, instant cross-border payments, and on-chain reputation for global talent.
We’re creating a decentralized layer that ensures freelancers and businesses across emerging markets can work and get paid instantly, securely, and transparently — powered by Polkadot’s scalability and interoperability.

The final platform will consist of three main layers:

**1. AI Work Intelligence Layer**
 Powered by Growwr’s proprietary AI engines:
- **TalentVerify™** – verifies identity, credentials, and skills using cross-referenced digital fingerprints, behavioral data, and social proofs.
- **SmartMatch™** – uses AI to match verified talent with projects using performance, culture-fit, and skill data.
- **PerformanceIQ™** – analyzes on-chain records and project outcomes to predict reliability and work quality.

**2. Blockchain Trust Layer (Polkadot/Substrate Integration)**
- **Decentralized Identity (DID)**: On-chain verified profiles for talent and businesses.
- **Smart Escrow Contracts:** Automate milestones, delivery, and secure payments using Polkadot stable assets.
- **Immutable Work Ledger**: Stores verified work transactions and performance metrics.
- **Reputation Protocol**: Builds transparent reputation scores based on verified contributions.

**3. Application Layer (Web + API)**
- Unified web platform and API suite for businesses and freelancers to hire, collaborate, and transact seamlessly — entirely on-chain.


**Mockups / UI Components**

Our UI is currently live and under continuous improvement.
Key interfaces include:
- **Employer Dashboard** – post roles, manage contracts, and execute escrow payments.
- **Talent Dashboard** – manage verified profiles, proposals, and track payouts.

**Scope Clarifications — What Growwr Will Not Implement**

- Growwr will not issue or manage tokens during the grant phase.
- The project will not handle decentralized exchanges or speculative financial products.
- We will not allocate grant funds to marketing, PR, or hosting overheads; all funds will be directed towards development and integration on Polkadot.

### Ecosystem Fit

**Where and how does your project fit into the Polkadot/Substrate/Kusama ecosystem?**

Growwr fits into the Polkadot ecosystem as a decentralized, AI-powered work infrastructure layer that brings trustless talent verification, on-chain identity, and borderless payments to the future of work. We leverage Polkadot’s multi-chain architecture to build interoperable components that serve both the talent and enterprise sides of hiring.

Our integration leverages:

- Substrate for building a decentralized Talent Identity Chain (TIC) — a registry of verified professionals, work history, and credentials.
- Polkadot parachains for cross-chain payment processing and smart contract settlement between clients and freelancers.
- Decentralized storage via IPFS for immutable portfolio records.
- Ink! smart contracts for escrow-backed milestone payments and automated performance releases.


**Who is your target audience?**

Our project serves two main user groups within the Polkadot ecosystem:

- Web3 companies and DAOs — who need verifiable, bias-free access to global talent (developers, designers, marketers, and community managers).
- Web3 professionals — who need on-chain proof-of-skill, verified reputation, and trustless payouts.

Indirectly, our work also supports parachain developers, dapp creators, and wallet builders, as Growwr can integrate their APIs for payments, identity, or analytics — expanding real-world utility across the ecosystem.

**What needs does your project meet?**

Growwr addresses three critical gaps in the decentralized work economy:

- Trustless Identity – Talent verification and credential validation on-chain, reducing fraud and bias.
- Secure Payments – Escrow-backed, automated payments for freelancers and employers across 180+ countries.
- On-Chain Reputation – Decentralized profiles showcasing verified work history, enabling transparent hiring and financing (credit, insurance, etc.).

We are effectively building the decentralized LinkedIn + Upwork for Web3, powered by Polkadot.

**How did you identify these needs?**

Our team validated these problems through:
- First-hand experience: Our founders lost contracts due to regional bias and payment failure — a reality faced by millions.
- User data: 17,000+ talent applications and 3,000+ businesses onboarded in our Web2 MVP show deep demand for verifiable, borderless hiring.
- Market research: 70% of freelancers in emerging markets experience delayed or missing payments; 54% of employers report poor hiring accuracy (Source: World Bank & IFC 2023).
- Community signals: Web3 DAOs and remote-first teams repeatedly cite the lack of trusted work reputation and compliance tools as barriers to scaling decentralized hiring.

**Are there similar projects in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?**

To date, there are no direct equivalents of Growwr within the Polkadot ecosystem. However, partial analogues exist:
- TalentLayer (EVM) – a decentralized hiring protocol, but lacks integrated AI vetting and productivity management.
- Braintrust (non-Polkadot) – focuses on tokenized work, not verified identity or performance.
- Dock.io (credentialing) – provides decentralized credentials but not work matching or escrow.

Growwr differs by offering an end-to-end AI + blockchain infrastructure covering:

1. Talent verification
2. AI-based matching
3. Escrow-backed payments
4. Productivity and upskilling

Verification systems were manual or non-scalable — Growwr’s AI engines automate that process.

**Are there similar projects in related ecosystems?**

Yes. In the broader Web3 space:
- Braintrust and TalentLayer target decentralized work but rely on self-attested data and don’t integrate AI.
- Deel and Remote.com solve cross-border payments but remain Web2, with no blockchain transparency.

Growwr bridges both worlds, combining AI vetting + decentralized infrastructure, making it the first trustless, AI-powered, multi-chain hiring ecosystem.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

This section should break the development roadmap down into milestones and deliverables. To assist you in defining it, we have created a document with examples for some grant categories [here](../docs/Support%20Docs/grant_guidelines_per_category.md). Since these will be part of the agreement, it helps to describe *the functionality we should expect in as much detail as possible*, plus how we can verify and test that functionality. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to this document to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an **example roadmap**. In the descriptions, it should be clear how your project is related to Substrate, Kusama or Polkadot. We *recommend* that teams structure their roadmap as 1 milestone ≈ 1 month.
