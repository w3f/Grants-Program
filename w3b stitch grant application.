W3b Stitch – Trust Engine for Decentralized Identity, Media Verification, and Credential Authentication

Status: Open (anyone is allowed to apply)

Proposer: rocketjays-cmyk

Your Project(s): https://github.com/rocketjays-cmyk/w3b-stitch

Projects you think this work could be useful for [optional]: Any ecosystem project requiring verifiable credentials, decentralized reputation systems, or authenticated media pipelines.

Teams/People that could deliver the RFP [optional]: W3b Stitch core contributors, with potential for open-source community collaboration.

Project Description :page_facing_up:

W3b Stitch proposes a modular trust engine for the decentralized web, focused on three core pillars:

Decentralized Identity (DIDs & Reputation): Enabling self-sovereign identity and trust scoring to empower users and organizations with verifiable digital presence.

Media Verification & Curation: Anchoring media artifacts (images, videos, text) with hash proofs and blockchain anchoring to combat misinformation and content manipulation.

Credential Authentication & Provenance: Issue, verify, and disclose credentials with privacy-preserving selective disclosure aligned with W3C Verifiable Credentials standards.

The project is useful for Web3 ecosystems where trust, provenance, and verification are critical — including decentralized social platforms, credential issuers, supply chain traceability, and DAO compliance.
