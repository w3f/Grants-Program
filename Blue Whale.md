## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

### Overview

- **Tagline:** Making Polkadot crypto transactions as easy as sending a WhatsApp message.
- **Description:**  
  Blue Whale is an AI-powered chatbot that allows users to send, receive, and manage Polkadot-based assets directly from WhatsApp. By integrating a smart wallet into a chat interface, we simplify crypto adoption and provide developers with open tools to build chat-based applications.
- **Integration with Polkadot:**  
  The project will integrate Polkadot smart wallets and dApps into WhatsApp via Westend Testnet for initial testing. Our SDKs and analytics tools will allow developers to connect Polkadot accounts, track user engagement, and build mini-apps within the messaging platform.
- **Team Interest:**  
  We are passionate about reducing barriers to crypto adoption and enabling non-technical users to interact with blockchain assets in familiar interfaces like WhatsApp.

### Project Details

- **UI Components:** WhatsApp mini-app interface for transactions, balance checking, and gamified interactions.
- **Data Models / API Specifications:** API endpoints for wallet creation, transaction signing, and mini-app interaction.
- **Technology Stack:** Polkadot/Substrate, Westend Testnet, Node.js backend, TypeScript SDK, analytics dashboard using React.
- **PoC/MVP:** Closed-beta version of the Blue Whale wallet is live on Westend.

## Ecosystem Fit

- **Fit in Polkadot:** Blue Whale enables mainstream user adoption by embedding Polkadot functionality into WhatsApp.
- **Target Audience:** Developers, mini-app creators, and non-technical users seeking simple Polkadot wallet access.
- **Needs Addressed:** Simplified onboarding, user-friendly crypto transactions, and actionable analytics for developers.
- **Evidence of Needs:** Feedback from Web3 developer communities, adoption challenges identified in forums, and prior Avalanche-based prototype results.
- **Comparable Projects:** There are no existing WhatsApp-integrated Polkadot wallets. Blue Whale is unique in combining chat-based UX with Polkadot smart wallets and developer tooling.
