# ParaSpell Maintenance

- **Team Name:** ParaSpell‚ú®
- **Payment Address:** 0xB7d45Ef044fD9342e4c03e28D9e9bddA2d4Fe3e1 (USDC)
- **[Level](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/tree/master#level_slider-levels):** 2 üê§

## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Previously completed grants:
- [Phase 1](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1118)
- [Phase 2](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1245)

What is ParaSpell:
ParaSpell is XCM & XCMP Developer tool ment to ease integration of cross-chain functionality into dApps. As we have learnt by now, cross-chain experience between Parachains can be very diverse. ParaSpell means to unify this experience by doing all the research for developers. We have wrapped all XCM pallets from compatible nodes into simple patterns from which it is easy to create XCM call. As an example we provide image below.

In this image we can see, that ParaSpell saves much time to developers. Just one call can contain multiple lines of JSON which would otherwise have to be integrated manually by developer. ParaSpell does it in marginally less lines and hides complex logic of building message which ensures, that messages are constructed correctly. This call in the end results into following lengthy extrinsic:

Following extrinsic can be subscribed into and we can check for it's events on front end. ParaSpell provides front end for testing XCM transactions and XCM called [UI-V2](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v2). This UI is also deployed on netlify so users only have to run local network to start testing. UI also provides ability to open or close HRMP channels or test out XYK pool functionality that was implemented in collaboration with HydraDX team. In the picture below we provide overview of the UI.

### Overview üé®

ParaSpell is split into three main repositories at the moment:

- [XCM SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk): Meant to unify cross-chain experience on Substrate. Can serve any dApp developer that wishes to integrate XCM or other pallets support for they app.
- [UI-V2](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v2): Allows for launching local network and testing XCM or HRMP channels across that local network
- [Docs](https://github.com/paraspell/docs): Extensive documentary for overview of ParaSpell, guide for SDK and UI


#### SDK
This SDK currently support 42 compatible XCM nodes.  They can transfer XCM messages in three different scenarios. 
- Parachain to Parachain - HRMP
- Parachain to Relay chain - UMP
- Relay chain to Parachain - DMP

SDK contains many useful features that allow for easier inntegration:
-  Builder pattern implementation, easy to construct XCM calls, much more used recently for simplicity of implementation.

- Suggestions, SDK contains TYPES that help to guide developer through integration. For example he get's compatible nodes suggested.

- Console printouts, SDK allows for printing into console so developer can alway check if call they constructed is correct.

- Exporting registered assets for each compatible node in many useful functions

- Exporting supported XCM pallets for each compatible node in useful functions

And more.. 

#### UI-V2
UI is used as testing tool for Parachain developers, they can simply add their node into network and test it with HRMP channels as well as XCM transfers. UI also allows dApp developers to test and learn XCM before integrating it from our SDK.

UI is made to be as simple to use as possible. It is now also deployed on netlify so developers only have to start local network from configuration file provided by ParaSpell which starts network of Relay chain and 3 different Parachains (Bifrost,Karura & Pichiu)

Below are some examples of UI with running network:
<img width="1341" alt="Screenshot 2023-02-16 at 13 31 06" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55763425/219366458-8873418e-9487-4762-8327-56c3294accdd.png">

Above we can see open/ close channel screen. It is simple to work with and intuitive. Nodes are pulled from relay chain by query so if network is not running you cannot see any nodes.

Above we can observe, that UI contains simple Wallet login with test accounts.

Above we can see XCM screen which is also very simple to navigate and nodes are pulled from relay chain by query.

Many more useful guides are yet to come during this 5 month period.

#### Why ParaSpell needs daily support

As XCM is still in development (With V3 being released just recently) more and more Parachains integrate support for XCM pallets with time. We need to check for this support periodicaly so we can keep up with new nodes being added so we can satisfy as many developers as possible. We also get some issues and suggestions which can further improve experience for developers.

- Du≈°an is the founder & researcher behind this project and he has successfully presented it at the international conference ICECET2022 held in Prague from which there is an article regarding XCMP & ParaSpell project. It is published by [IEEE](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9872938). Du≈°an also studies Blockchain technology and had a bachelor's thesis about cross-blockchain sharing from which this idea was born. Du≈°an also continues research on this idea in his Master's thesis. He is actively working on [ParaSpell](https://github.com/paraspell) full-time & has also participated in other ecosystem projects. Recently he attended Polkadot Blockchain Academy 2023 in Buenos Aires which gave him a lot of insight into the ecosystem and he also graduated from the academy successfully.

- Michael is a dedicated TypeScript developer with 2 years of full-time experience in the Web2 sphere. Michael's expertise in this field was further solidified in 2019 when he won first place in the Junior Internet Web competition for his online multiplayer game, which was written in JavaScript. In addition to his professional background, Michael also achieved a bachelor's degree in the same computer science University as Du≈°an and he is currently pursuing a master's degree which focuses on Blockchain. His passion for technology led him to explore Blockchain technology in his free time. He was recently offered the opportunity to work on ParaSpell XCM SDK with Du≈°an and he delivered many of the key features SDK now offers.

## Development Status :open_book: 

[SDK](https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk) is currently released into main and is in version that is fully operable. There are still some tweaks we plan to add and make, they are mentioned below. [UI-V2](https://github.com/paraspell/ui-v2) currently runs on state-of-the-art technology version VueJS 3 and newest version of Nuxt. It deprecated V1 and introduced much smoother interface and modules brought from subscaffold template ParaSpell contributed to. [Docs](https://github.com/paraspell/docs) are currently in ready state but there is still some tweaking to do.

## Maintenance Responsibilities :nut_and_bolt:

Both me and Michael will do monthly XCM support checkups (One of us in the beggining of the month and the other one in the middle of the month)
Michael will be in charge of implementing suggested features and issues raised in SDK.

Below we provide **example maintenance responsibilities**.

Issues we want to fix:
- Merge currency ID and currency symbol into one so user do not need to enther both. Raised in issue: https://github.com/paraspell/xcm-sdk/issues/16
- Add inline documentation where necessary.
- Remaster documentation to be more intuitive and more diverse with examples.
- Add suggestions we received in our previous grant evaluations (If not added already).
- Make more UNIT tests and make old tests run faster and more efficiently

Our responsibilities:
- We will maintain the project's documentation.
- We will answer issues and discussions.
- We will fix new bugs as we receive and help contributors who have pull requests get any needed information.
- We will do monthly checkups for XCM support on nodes ( that become compatible or if compatible nodes change their XCM pallet and it becomes incompatible with our SDK)  

Extras:
- We recently created new article about ParaSpell and Polkadot ecosystem which will soon be released on IEEE and presented at international conference (Which is yet to be selected)
