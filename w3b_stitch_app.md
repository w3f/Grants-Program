Project Description :page_facing_up:

W3b Stitch is a decentralized trust engine designed to solve misinformation, fake credentials, and weak identity systems. It enables verifiable media, authenticated credentials, and decentralized identity with dynamic reputation.

The system packages events into Trust Delta Records (TDRs), compiles them into Verifiable State Bundles (VSBs), and anchors them across multiple blockchains for scalability and auditability.

This proposal is valuable to the ecosystem because it provides a modular trust layer that other dApps, wallets, and enterprises can plug into — enabling users to verify media and credentials directly on-chain, while preserving privacy through selective disclosure.
