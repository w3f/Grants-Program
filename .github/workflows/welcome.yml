            Congratulations and welcome to the Web3 Foundation Grants Program! Please refer to our
            [Milestone Delivery repository](https://github.com/w3f/Grant-Milestone-Delivery/) for
            instructions on how to submit milestones and invoices, our
            [FAQ](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/faq.md) for frequently asked questions and the
            [support section of our README](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/README.md#support)
            for more ways to find answers to your questions. <br/><br/>
            Before you start, take a moment to read through our
            [announcement guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/blob/master/docs/announcement-guidelines.md)
            for all communications related to the grant or make them known to the right person in your organisation.
            In particular, please <b>don't announce the grant publicly before at least the first milestone of your
            project has been approved.</b> At that point or shortly before, you can get in touch with us at
            grantsPR@web3.foundation and we'll be happy to collaborate on an announcement about the work youâ€™re doing.<br/><br/>
            Lastly, please remember to let us know in case you run into any delays or deviate from the deliverables
            in your application. You can either leave a comment here or directly request to amend your application
            via PR. We wish you luck with your project! :rocket:
