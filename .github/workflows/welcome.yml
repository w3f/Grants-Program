            Congratulations! As part of the Open Grants Program, we want to help winning teams acknowledge their grants publicly. To that end, we’ve created a [badge for projects](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/grant-badge-guidelines.md)
            that successfully delivered their first milestone. Please observe the 
            [foundation’s guidelines](https://github.com/w3f/General-Grants-Program/blob/master/grants/announcement-guidelines.md) when making any announcements; in particular, <b>don’t announce the grant publicly before you've completed at least the first
            milestone of the project.</b> <br/><br/> 
            At that point, we will be happy to collaborate on an announcement about the work you’re doing. 
            Please get in touch with us at grantspr@web3.foundation in case you're interested (at least two weeks notice is preferred).
