## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Protico is at the forefront of developing the "Web3 Lobby," an ambitious project that aims to integrate "Social" as a foundational layer across various enterprise products.

### Overview

Protico is a social layer that empowers brands to build social assets directly on websites and apps, also offers them a new alternative to third-party cookies in their digital marketing efforts.

With Protico, brands can easily add a social widget onto their products where users can seamlessly leave comments, ask questions or share information as a native community with their crypto wallets anytime.

With the wallet-based community built, we also empower brands a new marketing tool by levegaring on-chain data which can be used as an alternative to third-party cookies in their digital marketing efforts.

A key aspect of our product design involves utilizing infrstructure like Polkadot to facilitate necessary transactions for our clients to their users. This integration will inevitably drive a significant uptick in users for Polkadot, fostering an ecosystem of symbiotic growth and development.


### Project Details

The project consists of two core parts:

1. The Web3 Lobby: Brands can embed this onto their products using JavaScript, or create it using our SDK & APIs.
2. The Dashboard: Brands can use this to manage communities, gaining insights into user behavior through on-chain data analytics. It also allows them to reward users with airdrops based on their level of engagement.

A quick demo can be checked here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7JBQW08wwQ
And, recently we have made some significant progress. We are on the verge of collaborating with several leading brands (we call them, the Web2 Legends), primarily in the media industry across Asia, with a combined audience base exceeding 10 million!

### Ecosystem Fit

- Where and how does your project fit into the ecosystem?
  Our project addresses a problem that is faced by 99.99% of Web2 brands, which also make up 99.99% of the user base. By achieving success, we aim to contribute to the "Massive Adoption" of the entire Web3 world, benefiting everyone in the Web3 ecosystem.
- Who is your target audience (parachain/dapp/wallet/UI developers, designers, your own user base, some dapp's userbase, yourself)?
  Web2 brands that care about communities and are seeking alternatives to third-party cookies for their digital business.
- What needs does your project meet?
    1. Many brands, whether they are web2 or web3, lack social assets such as user feedback or product discussions. We help them build these social assets quickly.
    2. With third-party cookies being deprecated on all browsers next year, brands are looking for alternative tools that can track users' cross-site behaviors and use them in their digital marketing strategies. Protico provides a new GDPR-compliant method to help brands maintain their understanding of user personas across different websites.
- Are there any other projects similar to yours in the Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama ecosystem?
  There are a few projects working in the "Social" field as well, but we are the first comprehensive and total solution for brands and users. We have a solid scenario and several success stories to support our claims. And if you search "Web3 Chat" or "Web3 Lobby" on Google, you will find that we are at the #1 in the results globally.
