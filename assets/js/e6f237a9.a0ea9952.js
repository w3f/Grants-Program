This cost is more market-oriented, and at the same time it is equivalent to the inflation rate of stablecoin to world assets.  In general, the stable currency cUSD and the synthetic asset issuance and contract exchanges in the Coinversation Protocol constitute a complete Defi system in the Polkadot ecosystem.
