The challenged claimer can dispute the state and find the first differing state interactively with the challenger. When either the differing PC or state is found, the chain will re-execute partially from the state and PC with consensus (i.e., state and PC before the differing ones) using LLVM bytecode virtual machine. Since the execution would lead to a concrete result that is directly equal to that of either challenger or claimer, the chain can decide which party is gaming. Partial re-execution is not costly since the chain only needs to execute the basic block with dispute, which is usually a few simple instructions.
