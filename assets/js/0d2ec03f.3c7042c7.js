The more bandwidth a device shares, the more credit will be earned by the account. Each device will delegate its credit to a validator. The consensus of the deeper chain will be the GRANDPA/BABE hybrid consensus built in the Substrate node. The validator election algorithm is initially based on both popularity of the validator and a white list, and the white list will be removed in future so that any party can run validator nodes once the network run smoothly for a certain period and is proved to be stable and secure. The popularity of a validator is simply calculated as the number of deeper network devices that delegate its credit to the validator.
