The new fair democracy provides an elegant way of governance that separates the representative responsibility according to their specialization and can grow into any complexity. The governance is divided into various departments, and each department is supervised by representatives with expertise in the field. Voters are rational and need to have enough knowledge about the departments and the department problems, in order to vote for the selecting representatives of a department.
