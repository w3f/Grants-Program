Seigniorage-style, uncollateralized or algo stablecoin is a token that uses algorithms to control the circulating supply to get a stable value of the asset. In general the price volatility of cryptocurrencies is one of the biggest barriers to widespread adoption. Stablecoins therefore have become a key component of DeFi applications. However, all successful existing stable coins (e.g. DAI, USDT, USDC, etc) are asset backed. Therefore they are subject to the same volatility and risk associated with the backing asset and the underlying process.
