The average person doesn\u2019t want to spend multiple hours to ensure the security of their keys. This leads to people having difficulties to join the blockchain space or even worse leads to the loss of funds. One solution to this problem is the implementation of a social recovery system. It allows users to recover their accounts if their key or other authentication mechanism has been lost. Therefore you usually set up at least 3 "guardians" (e.g. other devices, friends or family or institutions), of which a majority can cooperate to change the key of the account (often after some delay).
