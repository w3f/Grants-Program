Our solution, e.g., does not prioritize connecting existing NFTs but enables bidirectional binding of the NFT and proxy.\nConsequently, upon ownership of an NFT, we can discern from the NFT metadata indicating its status as an NFTAA.\nFurthermore, we enhance transparency by ensuring the atomic creation of the NFT and proxy within a single transaction, thereby promoting seamless integration.\nLikewise, our design does not need the registrar service to create the TBA address as opposed to TBA.\nIn our case, the pallet creates the NFTAA with functionality that also works as the NFTAA address (TBA uses one more address than NFTAA).\nAnother difference is that in TBA, you could have more accounts on one NFT, which, in our case, is not possible due to the atomic creation of exactly one NFT at the time of creating the NFTAA.\nRegarding security, there are at least two differences between NFTAA and TBA. The first is the possibility of generating the address of TBA sooner without having the deployed contract (as the create2 function for creating contracts is deterministic, i.e., you can calculate the future contract address).\nIn this case, if the upcoming smart contract is badly developed (does not contain an execute function for byte calls to other contracts) or is not upgradeable, it can happen that assets or liquidity sent to the TBA will not be withdrawable and become locked forever (even the NFT bounded in TBA can be sent by a mistake (if not safeguarded) to the address of TBA. Therefore you lock yourself from it).\nThe problem is that TBA uses only the address of any contract you want in the registry contract and does not look for any details on how the contract looks or if it is already deployed.
