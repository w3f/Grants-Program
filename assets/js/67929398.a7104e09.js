The white flag is the original internationally recognized protective sign of truce or ceasefire, and request for negotiation.

In addition, Fennel Protocol provides Whiteflag with basic identity and key management features based on the web of trust concept. The second grant project will expand our Whiteflag implementation beyond the minimally viable implementation, aiming to fully implement Whiteflag Protocol's messaging specification in Substrate; more concretely, the second grant project will implement Whiteflag Protocol's functional messages.
