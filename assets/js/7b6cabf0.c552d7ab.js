What we'd like to introduce is a mechanism for parachain collators to achieve consensus among themselves on the \"best\" block. This mechanism would most likely be realised as an additional runtime module in which all collators can (but don't have to) participate, thus providing a faster way for the users of parachain applications to see quasi-finalised blocks -> note that this sub-consensus on parachains will have no effect on the decision of relay chain validators' votes and can at times diverge from the outcome on the relay chain.\nShould this mechanism be opt-in for collators, they could be incentivised to participate honestly by bonding a small stake, that is later slashed (the stick) in case a relay-chain-finalised-block causes a reorg on the sub-consensus mechanism.
