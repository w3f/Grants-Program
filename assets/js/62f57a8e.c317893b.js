To start a match, the server must request that a \"match\" be created on chain via ink! smart contract after collecting a nominal fee from connected players.

In game events, such as when a player eliminates another player or environment enemy, will be written to chain.

Our engine will be similar to that used in Quake (id Software, Microsoft) and Half-Life (Valve, Sierra Studios), using various methods to compensate for latency and ensure a pleasant user experience, the key difference being that interactions leading to specific events will be logged to the chain.
