That is, when everyone is willing to add their free resources to the hamster network, it can be assumed that there are near-infinite computing resources in the network, and more quality services can be built and constructed in the hamster network. For example, service providers no longer need to rely on the support of a single cloud vendor, but only need to use the computing resources in the hamster network, and the system automatically schedules the resource arithmetic needed for the services to build their own services in the form of edge computing. In addition to this, we can also provide some toolkits so that these computing resources can participate in other services with one click, such as becoming a chain node of Thegraph, so that they can participate in other networks, and later on, we can also use incentives to encourage people to develop toolkits for different blockchain ecosystems.
