Societies with great social trust grow faster than those that do not trust each other. Today we have many private reputation systems: Airbnb, which allows travelers and homeowners to trust each other, Uber, which ranks taxi drivers and passengers by their history and comments about each other, Google Places, which ranks restaurants and other businesses... \\\nThe reputation systems mentioned above collect recommendations from people and centrally accumulate this value within a private company. \\\n",(0,r.kt)("a",{parentName:"li",href:"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/176431/1/10.1186_s40854-016-0039-4.pdf"},"It\u2019s known")," that such systems are vulnerable to ballot-stuffing, bad-mouthing, and various attack models including constant attack, camouflage attack, whitewashing attack and sybil attack. \\\nTraditional reputation systems try to solve such problems by tying economic interactions to reputation or ranking, for example Amazon.com flags a product's rating if it comes from a \"verified purchase\". However, such ratings can be influenced by the seller imitating the buyer and rating their own product. \\\nHowever, there is a well-known working orthogonal approach that has proven to be effective and stable for more than centuries and is decentralized - letters of recommendation. \\\nA letter of recommendation is a document issued by a person with a social reputation. Such a person (referee) recommends an employee for hiring in the company. The company can downgrade and ultimately damage the referee's reputation if they refer a bad employee, so the referee makes some profit from the employee before recommending them, often not in monetary terms to deal with such risk. Thus, the referee acts as an insurer. \\\nA letter of recommendation divides the rating system into two parts: a statement about the employee and the reputation of the referee. For example, if Uber uses this approach, then the taxi driver rating will consist of a series of letters of recommendation, and referees will lose reputation if they recommend a bad taxi driver to a new client. \\\nThe recommendation letter system has limited applications due to the difficulty of disseminating information about bad-faith referees who cheat the system, and the difficulty of calculating the actual reputation of the referee. \\\nWe are aiming to create a blockchain recommendation letter system that can solve the problems of maintaining the reputation of referees and punishing them in case of bad recommendations."),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"Our team has an experience of using a recommendation letter system at a public school education.

The referee key is linked to a publicly visible reputation balance. If the referee\'s balance falls below the amount of the letter penalty, the letter of recommendation is considered temporarily void. If the worker wants to present the employer with an active letter of recommendation for employment, the employee signs an agreement to give the employer the right to impose fines. The worker knows the real identity and public keys of the employees and referee, the referee know the real identity and public key of the worker. The referee knows the public key of who fined him and the real identity of the worker who had the letter. This information is enough to prevent "silent" fines. Referees can keep track of each penalty with the help of a worker. A Sibyl attack is basically impossible in such a system, since all transactions are carried out between real individuals. Note that the worker can be his own referee, but it is economically unprofitable for him, because he cannot adequately determine the risk of being a bad worker. It is safer for the employee not to issue the letter himself, but to ask the referee to do it.'),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"A letter of recommendation is NOT registered on the blockchain when issued. This design principle saves blockchain space and hides important personal information from intruders. A letter of recommendation is a sign by guarantee of a string consisting of the letter_id, the public key of the guarantee, the public key of the worker, and the amount of reputation staked on this letter. The worker can sign the employer's right to send a letter of recommendation to the blockchain to penalize the guarantee."),(0,r.kt)("li",{parentName:"ul"},"We plan to use Rust / Substrate to complete this part of the project. We initially thought that smart contracts on Ethereum/Polka etc would be enough. However we implement the system that should process requests from millions of users every day. \\\nLet's calculate the required number of transactions per second. \\\nThere are two types of transactions that are sent: first - usual for any blockchain - transfer of SLON between holders. We will not count this type of transaction because the number of second type transactions is large enough to convince us that we need a parallelization.\nThe second type transaction is a reimbursement where the person who is eligible to punish the recommender uses that right. \\\nWe will take into account only our educational project where we do have real world statistics about reimbursement transactions.\nUsually we process about 30 reimbursements per 45 minutes lesson per class of 20 students or 0.67 transactions per minute per 20 students.\nIn Russia there are about 15 million pupils at schools. If we assume that all teachers will use such a system at lesson we get (0.671510^6/20) transactions per minute or 8375 transactions per second. \\\nSubstrate gives about 1000 transactions per second per chain. Thus we need at least 9 chains only for Russia to make this blockchain work. One can argue that in Russia there are different time zones and transaction load will be lowered by this means. But don't forget that on Earth we have about 50x more pupils than in Russia. \\\nThus no single chain can process transactions if all pupils in Russia will use our educational model at classes - too many transactions, even considering that we use offchain as much as possible. Thus we look for any approach to shard and parallelize transaction processing. Polkadot design with relay and parachains looks great to solve this parallelization issue. As we need a lot of parachains to make the system work it's unlikely to include all of them in Polkadot or Kusama directly. Instead we plan to use our own relay chain with our parachains.
