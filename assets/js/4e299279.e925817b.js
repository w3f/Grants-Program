To achieve this design purpose, Rust leverages static compiler checks to rule out severe memory and thread safety issues at the compilation time. At runtime, Rust behaves like C/C++ and could deliver performance that is as good as C/C++. Due to its safety and performance benefits, Rust has seen increasing adoption in building low-level systems software, such as OSs and browsers. Rust is also used to implement many software systems in the Web3 technology stack (e.g., substrate, polkadot, ink!)."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Rust's compiler checks are based on a suite of ownership and lifetime rules. The basic rule allows one value to only have one owner variable, and the value is dropped (freed) when its owner variable ends its lifetime. Rust extends the basic rule to allow ownership to be moved and borrowed, while still guaranteeing all accesses to a value to be within its owner variable's lifetime scope. Besides safety checks, lifetime is also used for automated resource management. For example, there is no explicit Unlock() in Rust. A Lock() function call returns a reference to the protected variable, and when the reference ends its lifetime, Rust automatically releases the acquired lock (by implicitly calling Unlock())."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Rust's lifetime rules are complex and different from all other existing languages.
