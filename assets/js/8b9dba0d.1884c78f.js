Rainbowcity is committed to building a digital city-state based on token economy and community governance. The core idea of Rainbowcity is DAO. We hope to build Rainbowcity into a trillion-dollar super-economy through 10 years of development, and create a virtual city-state based on the blockchain, and create a free state that adheres to the spirit of bitcoin, and to create a new civilization for mankind."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Rainbowcity is a DAO, and the design of the entire project is centered on DAO. In 2020 and 2021, the main work of our team is to design the Rainbowcity  project and develop Rainbowcity DAO. In the past, we focused on the Ethereum market and built the entire ecosystem of Rainbowcity on the Ethereum main chain and L2 network in the form of smart contracts. Therefore, our team mainly develops RainbowcityDAO smart contracts based on solidity."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"In the past year, we have developed a complete product of RainbowcityDAO in solidity language.

The development workload is one of the largest projects in the Ethereum ecosystem."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"However, when we fully developed the RainbowcityDAO contract, after a comprehensive evaluation by our team, the Ethereum ecosystem could not support the operation of the entire Rainbowcity project.

One is to continue to stick to the Ethereum ecosystem, wait for the maturity of the Ethereum L2 network, and build the Rainbowcity ecosystem on the basis of the L2 network. The second is to build a completely independent public chain by ourself, and build the Rainbowcity ecology in the form of our own public chain. The third is to choose other emerging public chains in the market."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"After various investigations, we chose the Polkadot ecosystem created by Dr. Gavin Wood to conduct a comprehensive investigation on the Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama ecosystems.

As we learn more about Dr. GavinWood, we find that Substrate and Polkadot are our best choices."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"Therefore, in June 2021, we made the biggest decision of our team in the past three years to suspend our development and research in the Ethereum ecosystem and join the Substrate and Polkadot ecosystem created by Dr. Gavin Wood. Our developers have also begun to switch development languages, starting from the original solidity to Rust and ink!. This is the most important decision our team has made in the past three years. Abandoning the familiar technology and learning new development technology is also a major challenge for our development team. However, we are not afraid of this challenge, and actively embrace this challenge. We firmly believe that Substrate and Polkadot belong to the future of blockchain."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"At the same time, inspired by the relationship between Substrate and Polkadot, we have also adjusted the product structure. The original Rainbowcity was an independent project, an independent DAO, and our development was also based on this DAO. All our development needs are the needs of the project itself, and these DAO tools cannot meet the general needs of other DAOs. Inspired by the relationship between Substrate and Polkadot, we decided to abstract the product that was originally only applicable to RainbowcityDAO and make it applicable to various DAOs. This is why we launched RainbowDAO Protocol ink! today. Our team has been conducting research internally for the past six months, and now we have a preliminary and complete system.
