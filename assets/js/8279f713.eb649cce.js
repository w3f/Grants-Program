Coretime was introduced in this context, addressing the issue of slot auctions to some extent. Additionally, the development of the Tanssi network has shown the appeal of low technical barriers for initial teams. In summary, the above solutions address the technical and financial barriers for startup teams, all aimed at promoting the widespread adoption of Polkadot technology. However, all of this assumes that these projects have a centralized team (in reality, many community projects do not have such a team, such as the Dota Inscription project on Polkadot) and have the financial capability to pay for these services, as well as sufficient profitability or passion to support the long-term operation of the chain. This, to some extent, causes their users to lose long-term confidence. Essentially, it does not solve the dilemma of developers needing to pay for the project in advance and for the long term, nor the issue of reliance on centralized teams.I believe the best model should be the coexistence of solo chains and parachains. When a project has not yet found a profitable model and more users, it should use the solo chain approach. This way, it can fully utilize the technical advantages of Polkadot Substrate and have greater flexibility than parachains. In fact, staking can fully mobilize community activity and participation in new projects. When the business reaches a certain scale and there is a need for shared security, and there is funding, parachains can be considered.
