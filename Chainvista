ðŸ“„ Project Overview

Overview:
ChainVista is an all-in-one Web3 security and discovery platform that protects investors from scams, high-risk presales, and dangerous token contracts by combining native smart contract scanning, presale scoring, whale intelligence, and airdrop eligibility into a unified interface.

Relation to Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama:
The security scanning and wallet intelligence tools will be adapted to support Substrate-based chains and provide a public safety layer for presales, parachain tokens, and airdrop discovery within the Polkadot ecosystem.

Why are we building this:
We are deeply committed to solving the trust and transparency gap in Web3 investing. By simplifying smart contract security and presale verification, we aim to reduce losses, improve safety, and drive sustainable user adoption across Polkadot and its parachains.

ðŸ“„ Project Details

Designs / Mockups:

Mockups and design wireframes available and will be provided with MVP.

Data Models / API Specs:

Token Scanner API integration (GoPlusLabs + Custom Parser)

Whale tracking API (The Graph + on-chain wallet data)

Airdrop Eligibility Checker (wallet interaction scoring)

Admin backend (presale listings and audit aggregation)


Tech Stack:

Frontend: Next.js, React, TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js serverless functions, PostgreSQL DB

APIs: The Graph, Moralis, Alchemy, GoPlusLabs, RugDoc

Wallet Connect: WalletConnect v2, RainbowKit

Admin: React-Admin Stack


Documentation:

Full documentation will be provided with milestone deliveries.

PoC/MVP:

Early MVP functional demo already architected and designed. Backend modules partially implemented.

Scope Limitations:

We will not deliver tokenomics, token launch, or DAO governance in this grant scope.

This phase excludes advanced production-level smart contract audits and legal certifications.
ðŸ“„ Ecosystem Fit

Fit into Ecosystem:
ChainVista will become a trusted security discovery layer for Polkadotâ€™s parachains, presales, and DeFi projects.

Target Audience:
Retail investors, launchpads, DAOs, Web3 communities, parachain presale platforms, wallets.

Needs Solved:
Security transparency for presales, token contract risks, whale monitoring, and airdrop eligibility scoring.

Evidence of Need:
Billions lost in crypto scams (e.g. rug pulls, honeypots). Community demand for presale vetting tools and contract transparency is validated in multiple Web3 forums, research studies, and security incident reports.

Existing Alternatives:
TokenSniffer, GoPlus, CryptoRank, DEXTools (standalone tools only).
Our Difference: ChainVista unifies all these functions into one platform with affiliate-powered presale discovery, scoring, and whale intelligence in one interface.
