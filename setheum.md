## Project Overview :page_facing_up: 

### Overview

Please provide the following:
  * A brief description of the project.
  * An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
  * An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

The Setheum Network MVP will include the following parts

* **The STP258 (Setheum Tokenization Protocol [to-fiat]) Stablecoin Standard Module:** 34 fiat currencies that can be spent on SettPay and are also represented in a basket token.
* **The SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) Token Elasticity Module:** Designed to make cryptocurrencies that are backed by other cryptocurrencies with the PES (Price Elasticity of Supply) algorithm utilized for token elasticity of supply (TES) algorithm.
* **Setheum Chain using Substrate** to enable all in one DeFi & DeCo development and interoperability including the following modules:
  - The STP258 Module, which we are developing and is open-sourced for the community to use and build upon. It is a stablecoin protocol that offers 34 fiat-pegged stablecoins and a family stablecoin that is pegged to all the 34 stablecoins as a basket of tokens.
  - The SERP Module, which we are developing and is open-sourced for the community to use and build upon. It is an elastic fully decentralized stablecoin protocol that functions like a decentralized Central Bank
  - Various modules specific to manage Distribution of STP258/SERP-TES Monetary Issuance, Ecommerce payment, et al.
* **SettPay:** The Setheum Wallet for the STP258 Stablecoins, to function like a traditional Bank. Later on to add features to pay on ecommerce platforms with any cryptocurrency through the STP258 protocol, to enable minting of STP258 stablecoins, peer to peer transactions, and later on in the near future we will add Subsocial in the SettPay Dapp as a micro-service just like Alipay chat in AliPay.

Setheum Labs props, supports, nurtures and stewards applications in the fields of Decentralized Finance protocols particularly e-commerce (Decentralized E-Commerce or DeCo) and protocols that can serve as open finance building blocks such as stable currency and synthetic assets. Setheum Network is a focal R&D project initiated the Setheum Labs. Setheum Labs is founded by Muhammad-Jibril B.A. participant of the Polkadot ecosystem. Deco is now like a store where anyone can sell anything, it is basically a financial framework and infrastructure for normal eCommerce platforms/apps to integrate or build their payment gateways on to give free discounts to their users/customers through Setheum's elastic distribution of stablecoins by the SERP-TES.
We will integrate this project into Substrate, Polkadot and Kusama by developing Substrate Modules and running Polkadot & Kusama Parachains.
Our Team is more than interested in creating this project because we see a gap in the cryptocurrency industry, how cryptocurrency is being used and the limited access to more diverse stablecoins. And we want to create fully decentralized stablecoins that function like Central Banks and have their own decentralized Monetary Policy and Fiscal Regime. I am an eCommerce entrepreneur and I know the pain points of the seller especially the most painful - that is the Payment Systems, the payment gateways are too complicated and have unreasonable difficulty in selling to a worldwide audience. Setheum makes a payment gateway I can use on my App to sell anywhere in any cryptocurrency and in fiat.

### Project Details 
We are building a decentralized, cross-chain, community-owned DeFi (Decentralized Finance)and DeCo (Decentralized Commerce) system - the Setheum Network, to enable true economic interoperability, cross-chain liquidity and scalability. Along with the system, we are also building an economic model and governance framework to sustain the development, and continuous participation in the Polkadot ecosystem (e.g. as parachain and will setup a non-profit foundation to foster development on the Polkadot Ecosystem - especially in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia), until ultimately transitioning the network to community ownership. The Setheum Network will serve as a building block for DeCo and DeFi applications such as SettIndex in the Polkadot Ecosystem, and will provide new use cases for quality assets in the Polkadot ecosystem, such as DOT and new upcoming Polkadot projects such as Kylin, ChainLink, Open Ethereum et al..
   
As for the SettPay Wallet UI, it is not simply based on polkadot.js, it will be separate UI? We currently don't have mock-ups. We are planning to use ReactJS or VueJS frameworks written in JavaScript.

The stablecoins are backed by the DNAR, just like the gold standard. The DNAR is the Gold.
A partial derivative stablecoin (SETT) - pegged to 34 fiat-pegged stablecoins (a basket of currencies just like the IMF's SDR).

Setheum also offers a Central Bank type of monetary regime to issue it's elastic stablecoins, but unlike the Central banks, SERP-TES is decentralized and it distributes the new supply of stablecoins as discounts and cashback when users pay with SettPay. SettCard will soon be offered.

### Ecosystem Fit 
Are there any other projects similar to yours? If so, how is your project different?
Setheum offers a stablecoin market unlike any orher, unique.
Libra offers a basket token pegged to various fiat currencies that can only be spent as a basket token, we offer a basket token of Fully Decentralized Algorithmic Crypto-Collateralized Elastic Stablecoins backed by our governance token. I invented the SERP-TES and the STP258 Protocols. And the STP20 Protocol is coming soon. We designed everything from the ground up to repell any economic catastrophy that Libra can not withstand. We developed a Monetary Policy that even large Banks would love to immitate and we do it under the Apache 2.0 License.

Acala provides a single multi-collateral USD-pegged stablecoin.
We offer an elastic stablecoin protocol (SERP-TES) that mints and contracts the supply of SETT depending on the Demand Curve.
As if it increases in value over it's peg then more is minted as inflation, and the protocol will buy back during contraction.

The stablecoins are backed by the DNAR, just like the gold standard. The DNAR is the Gold.
A partial derivative stablecoin (SETT) - pegged to 34 fiat-pegged stablecoins (a basket of currencies just like the IMF's SDR).


The jSETT will be multi-collateral and pegged to the SETT, so you can mint jSETT by locking DOT or KSM et al, it is still linked to the DNAR, because as jSETT is transacted, DNAR gets transaction fees thus increasing the Value of the DNAR and thus minting more SETT for discounts and cashback. So the jSETT is also far from same with Acala's aUSD.

Setheum also offers a Central Bank type of monetary regime to issue it's elastic stablecoins, but unlike the Central banks, SERP-TES is decentralized and it distributes the new supply of stablecoins as discounts and cashback when users pay with SettPay. SettCard will soon be offered.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt: 

The Setheum Network Milestone 1 will be a 6 week project, aims to deliver a running MVP Substrate chain testnet providing algorithmically elastic stablecoins - the STP258 Sett tokens. Upon the testnet launch, we will implement a basic version of its economic model and work towards a Canary Network Launch and an Initial Parachain Offering of the Canary network on Kusama. And then work towards launching the Mainnet with all of the future plans we provided above and move towards an Initial Parachain Offering (IPO) of the Mainnet of Setheum network, participation in the IPO auction will depend upon the readiness of the Polkadot network.

### Overview
   
* **Total Estimated Duration:** 6 Weeks
* **Full-time equivalent (FTE):**  1.5
* **Total Costs:** 1.5 BTC

### Milestone 1 - The SERP Modules
* **Estimated Duration:** 6 Weeks
* **FTE:**  1.5
* **Costs:** 1.5 BTC

| Number | Deliverable | Specification |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 0a. | License | Apache 2.0 |
| 0b. | Testing Guide | The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests | 
| 1. | Substrate module: `stp258` (0.3 BTC - 2 weeks)| We will Implement The STP258 (Setheum Tokenization Protocol to-fiat Module) Stablecoin Standard Module - 34 fiat currencies that can be spent on SettPay and are also represented in a basket token. The `stp258` module will fetch the prices of the fiat pegs of the `stp258` tokens / sett tokens and create stablecoins that are pegged to those fiat currencies and back the supply of the currencies by the `serp_tes`. The module will have a `basket_token` that will be pegged to a number of currencies. We will implement a `sett_swap` module that will utilize the `stp258` to offer atomic swap between `stp258` tokens. |  
| 2. | Substrate module: `serp_tes` (0.8 BTC - 2 weeks) | We will Implement The SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) Token Elasticity Module: Designed to make cryptocurrencies that are backed by other cryptocurrencies with the PES (Price Elasticity of Supply) algorithm utilized for token elasticity of supply (TES) algorithm. The serp_tes module will bring the serp modules together to interact. It will compute the contraction and supply of `DNAR-SETT`, trade with the `serp_market`, mint and burn `DNAR_SETT` to and from the `serp_market` and the `settpay_serp`. There are 2 scenarios where the `serp_tes` comes into play, the contraction of `DNAR-SETT`, and the supply of `DNAR-SETT`. There are two scenarios that deal with both the contraction and the supply of `DNAR-SETT`, what happens when SETT dumps / bearish, and what happens when SETT pumps / bullish. When SETT pumps, the `serp_tes` does this: `price_cp` is the price of the `SETT` compared to the peg and `neg_sett` is returned when SETT is negative against the peg, and `change_in_price` is the change in price of `SETT` then for `elast`, `if stable_price < peg_price`, then execute `sett_mint`, `else if stable_price > peg_price`, then `dinar_mint`, `return elast`. `elast` is `p2 - p1`, `p2` is the current price while `p1` is the previous price in a given amount of time, lets say 6 seconds - the blocktime. The `serp_tes` does the same during contraction but in the opposite direction. |
| 3. | Substrate module: `serp_market` (0.4 BTC - 2 weeks) | We will Implement The SERP (Setheum Elastic Reserve Protocol) Token Elasticity Market Module: Designed to make contraction and supply with the validators. During `SETT` contraction, the `serp_tes` mints `DNAR` to the `serp_market` to buy back `SETT` from the `sett_stake` in return for `DNAR` to be staked for the validators, the `SETT` is then bought more valuable than it's market price, the `buying_price` is set through this: `buying_price = (market_price + (mint_rate * 2))`; so the buying price is the `market_price` of the `SETT` plus twice the percentage of `DNAR` minted, which is the change in price of `SETT`. So, if the `market_price` of `SETT` is $2.0 USD and the `mint_rate` is 10%, meaning 10% of `SETT` price needs to be raised back to the peg, then the `serp_market` buys back `SETT` from the validators at the price of $2.44 USD with `DNAR`, then `staking_rewards` reduce in proportion to the newly minted `DNAR`, in the case of our example the `staking_rewards` are contracted not by 20% of the staking rewards but by the `staking_reward` percentage `- (mint_rate x2)` which is - 0.44, therefore the `new_staking_reward` should be 29.56. And if you calculate it, when a nominator stakes $100 worth of `DNAR` then they get $15 of `DNAR` rewards and during `dinar_mint` they get more `DNAR` without losing `staking_rewards`, because the `staking_rewards` increase when `sett_mint` and decrease when `dinar_mint`. And the `trades` with `serp_market` buys from the validators with more value than the `market_price`. Later in the future we will let the validators get `jSETT` as a liquid incentive to stake more `SETT` for the `serp_market` to trade with, that also increases the price of `SETT`, which in turn increases minting which in turn increases discounts in `SettPay` and `DNAR` buyback from the validators which in turn still increases the price of both `DNAR` and `SETT`.

### Community engagement

As part of the Program, we will produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on our [Medium Publication](https://medium.com/setheum-labs)). It should explain our work done as part of the grant. 
We will publish multiple articles after the completion of different deliverables.
