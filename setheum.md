Project Overview 📄

If this application in response to an RFP then please indicate this on the first line of this section.
Overview

Please provide the following:

    A brief description of the project.
    An indication of how you will integrate this project into Substrate / Polkadot / Kusama.
    An indication of why your team is interested in creating this project.

Project Details

We expect the teams to already have a solid idea about the project's expected final state.

Therefore, we ask the teams to submit (where relevant):

    Mockups/designs of any UI components
    API specifications of the core functionality
    An overview of the technology stack to be used
    Documentation of core components, protocols, architecture etc. to be deployed
    PoC/MVP or other relevant prior work or research on the topic

Development Roadmap 🔩

This section should break out the development roadmap into a number of milestones. Since the milestones will appear in the grant contract, it helps to describe the functionality we should expect, plus how we can check that such functionality exists in the product. Whenever milestones are delivered, we refer to the contract to ensure that everything has been delivered as expected.

Below we provide an example roadmap. In the descriptions it should be clear how the project is related to Substrate and/or Polkadot. We recommend that the scope of the work can fit within a 3 month period and that teams structure their roadmap as 1 month = 1 milestone.

For each milestone:

    Please be sure to include a specification of the software. The level of detail must be enough so that we are able to verify that the software meets the specification.
    Please include total amount of funding requested per milestone.
    Please note that we require documentation (e.g. tutorials, API specifications, architecture details) in each milestone. This ensures that the code can be widely used by the community.
    Please provide a test suite, comprising unit and integration tests, along with a guide on how to run these.
    Please commit to providing a dockerfiles for the delivery of your project.
    Please indicate the milestone duration, as well as number of Full-Time Employees working on each milestone, and include the number of days along with their cost per day.

Overview

    Total Estimated Duration: Duration of the whole project
    Full-time equivalent (FTE): Workload of an employed person (see)
    Total Costs: Amount of Payment in BTC for the whole project. The total amount of funding needs to be below $30k at the time of submission.

Milestone 1 Example — Implement Substrate Modules

    Estimated Duration: 1 month
    FTE: 1
    Costs: 0.75 BTC

Number 	Deliverable 	Specification
0a. 	License 	Apache 2.0 / MIT / Unlicense
0b. 	Documentation 	We will provide both inline documentation of the code and a basic tutorial that explains how a user can (for example) spin up one of our Substrate nodes. Once the node is up, it will be possible to send test transactions that will show how the new functionality works.
0c. 	Testing Guide 	The code will have proper unit-test coverage (e.g. 90%) to ensure functionality and robustness. In the guide we will describe how to run these tests
1. 	Substrate module: X 	We will create a Substrate module that will... (Please list the functionality that will be coded for the first milestone)
2. 	Substrate module: Y 	We will create a Substrate module that will...
3. 	Substrate module: Z 	We will create a Substrate module that will...
4. 	Substrate chain 	Modules X, Y & Z of our custom chain will interact in such a way... (Please describe the deliverable here as detailed as possible)
5. 	Docker 	We will provide a dockerfile to demonstrate the full functionality of our chain
Milestone 2 Example — Additional features

Community engagement

As part of the Program, we require that you produce an article/tutorial and publish it (for example on Medium). It should explain your work done as part of the grant.

Normally, we ask you to submit the write-up upon the completion of your grant, although for larger projects it might make sense to publish multiple articles after the completion of different milestones.
Future Plans

Please include the team's long-term plans and intentions.
