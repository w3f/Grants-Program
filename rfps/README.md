## :grey_question: What is an RFP?

An RFP (Request for Proposals) is a declaration of interest for others to submit a grant application regarding a specific project. They usually revolve around issues that the author (often someone from our team, but [anyone can suggest one](/README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project)) deems useful and missing or unsolved in our ecosystem.

If you find an open RFP here that you think you can address, feel free to [submit a grant application](../README.md#1-application). There is a [section in our application template](../applications/application-template.md#project-overview-page_facing_up) where you can reference the RFP you are addressing.


## :scroll: List of RFPs

**Status:**
- **:green_circle: Open:** We are looking for (additional) teams to implement this. 
- **:yellow_circle: Under Development:** One or more teams are working on this. We might be interested in additional implementations, but it’s better to double check this with the grants team.  
- **:red_circle: Implemented:** This RFP is implemented. However, if it’s not maintained, we would be interested in signing a [maintenance grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program#hammer_and_wrench-maintenance-grants).

## :mailbox_with_mail: Suggest an RFP

If you think that we should support the development of certain tools or projects (related to **Polkadot, Kusama or Substrate**) that aren't in the Polkadot/Kusama [tech stack](docs/polkadot_stack.md), please submit a suggestion using the process described in our [Grants program README](../README.md#mailbox_with_mail-suggest-a-project). We are particularly interested in supporting projects that could be leveraged by other builders in our ecosystem.
