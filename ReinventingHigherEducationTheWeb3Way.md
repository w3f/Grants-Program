## Project Overview :page_facing_up:

Women in Blockchain Canada will collaborate with Sydtek to deliver high-quality Substrate training globally as well as enable the general public to see the unprecedented benefit of using the Polkadot ecosystem to allow for greater community impact. Many projects thus far have addressed nearly every facet of need within the blockchain and crypto industry, from lending, borrowing, yield aggregation, fast-settling and low-cost infrastructure, payment rails, collectibles, blockchain ecosystems, gaming, security, automation, decentralization - and yet few attempt to address the core issue of the space: how to attract a new generation of developers to build novel blockchain applications for a more ethical and sustainable future. In this proposal, therefore, we will address the need for building a new generation of developers within the Polkadot ecosystem. 

### Our Vision

At Women in Blockchain Canada (WIBC), we are a not-for-profit organization aiming to inspire women to become involved in blockchain technology through educational conferences, social networking, and hands-on workshops. 
SydTek aims to solve this by creating a token-powered incentive mechanism to encourage students and new developers to learn how to build blockchain programs on SydTek’s Substrate blockchain. 


### Overview

- This project is anticipated to be part of a series of events that will promote the use of the Web3 ecosystem to a diverse audience. 
- The events will run as workshops and hackathons that target those who are technical and non-technical. Indeed, our instructors will teach how to use a wallet and how to develop in Substrate.  
- The users will be integrated in the Polkadot ecosystem through our promotion via the social-media platforms including Twitter, Discord, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube. 
- WIBC is interested in working on this project as it aligns with our vision to inspire women to become involved in blockchain technology through educational conferences, social networking, and hands-on workshops. 
- We believe in the Polkadot ecosystem and their governance structure and want to collaborate to build a community that is inclusive. 
- Many women are new to cryptocurrency and they deserve a safe and welcoming environment to help them learn and grow in confidence in using digital assets.
- All of this growth is incredibly promising for the blockchain and crypto space - new platforms are finding real-world use cases for their applications and token ecosystems are finding their way into everyday lives.
- Yet the supply of blockchain developers remains extremely thin. For example, among software developers in India, one of the leading technology outsourcing markets, only 0.4% of developers have blockchain skills. 
- However, as with every new fast-growing industry, there is a shortage of talent, SydTek will aim to close the gap through the workshops/events it will host with WIBC.
- Our team consists of developers who are Substrate certified and already involved in projects within the Polkadot ecosystem, including the Phala Network. 
- Our team has a proven track record of hosting events online and in person. 
- SydTek University will be built within the Bit.Country metaverse where the Founder of Sydtek holds 10,000 land blocks.


### Project Details

The proposed project will be part of a series of events that will promote the use of the Web3 ecosystem to a diverse audience. Logistically, the events will run as workshops and hackathons that target those who are technical and non-technical. Indeed, our instructors will teach participants how to use a wallet and how to develop in Substrate. The users will be further integrated in the Polkadot ecosystem through community-building efforts on social media platforms including Twitter, Discord, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube. The relevant course materials that will be distributed to participants are as follows:

### Ecosystem Fit

There are many Women in Blockchain organizations. However, there are few companies that are already partnered with startup accelerators, companies, and international universities. Our team consists of developers who are substrate certified and already involved in projects within the Polkadot ecosystem, including the Phala Network. Our team has a proven track record of hosting events online and in person. Further, our partnership with the University of Nicosia allows us to invite over 60 thousand participants to our event. Additionally, we have a broad audience on our social-media channels. For example, our companies and team members have over 20 thousand crypto enthusiast followers on Twitter alone. In addition, to those 20 thousand crypto enthusiasts, our twitter accounts can collectively reach over 150 thousand impressions per month (i.e., the number of times a tweet appears to users in either their timeline or search results). This is compounded by the fact that our past and current sponsors, such as Invest Ottawa and Ubitquity, actively promote our events to their networks. Further, our unique twist on the kind of topics that are covered during events is an advantage. We focus on innovating within the space. As such, the proposed events will enhance the current ecosystem by bringing in a broad audience from our partnerships with startup incubators and university partners.

## Development Roadmap :nut_and_bolt:

The scope of the work is quite broad as it is first necessary to design and develop the learning materials. As such, this requires further research and analysis of relevant information and selection of an appropriate format for delivery. Here, we propose two parts within the development phase: **1) Event materials specific to the Polkadot governance; 2) A guide for running a node; 3) An introduction to the metaverse.**

Once developed and approved, the learning package, as set out above, is to be delivered to three groups of 100-200 participants as well as be posted on YouTube in an attempt to maximize knowledge dissemination. There will be prescheduled opportunities for the participants to ask questions. This will not only serve to enrich the learning materials but also form the basis for the creation of an annotated outline for the future development events.
The work can be broken down into three parts:

- Design and production of course materials 
- Preparation of marketing materials and community building
- Delivery of training
